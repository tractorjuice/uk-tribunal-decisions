The Old School Rooms (“the Building”) is an apartment block on the south\nside of Great Moor Street on the edge of the town centre of Bolton. The\nBuilding is a Grade II listed property built in 1897 and was the former\ncounty grammar school. The Respondent converted the Building into 35\nresidential apartments in 2004. The Building is laid out over four floors\nincluding one floor below ground. Half of the floor below ground is\nundeveloped but is referred to as “the commercial unit” and that is how\nit was designated in the original planning permission. There is no\ncommercial lease for the commercial unit. The original external walls of\nthe Building are solid brick. There is a pitched original roof with two\ninternal valleys and mostly original slate. The windows are mostly\noriginal timber sliding sash windows with secondary internal glazing\nfitted internally. There is a main entrance, three internal staircases and\na lift. Internally, original features have been retained such as doors,\nwood panels and bookcases. Externally, there are car parking areas to\neither side of the building, to the west and to the east.\n2\n\n2. This case concerns a dispute about the service charges payable by the\nleasehold owners of those residential apartments. The case was brought\nby many leaseholders who say that the amount of the service charges\nthey have been required to pay over several years are unreasonable.\nSome of the leaseholders have withheld their service charge payments.\n3. The totality of the residential service charge expenditure has increased\nsignificantly in recent years: in 2017-2018, for example, it was £41,036\nand, by 2021-2022, that figure had risen to about £311,936. This is due\nto major works which were carried out by the Respondent in 2019-2020\ncosting over £300,000 which created a large sinking fund deficit and led\nto further significant demands being sent to the leaseholders.\n4. The Building was in a poor state of repair before the major repair works\nwere undertaken (something which is substantiated by both parties’\nevidence). The state of the Building led to damage to some of the\nindividual apartments; the repair of which the Respondent paid for. The\nRespondent also funded some of the repairs to the Building itself. The\nApplicants believe that the state of disrepair which the Respondent\nallowed the Building to reach exacerbated the cost of the subsequent\nrepair work. Furthermore, the Applicants have concerns as to the\nstandard of the work and services provided by the Respondent. Given all\nthat and the amount by which the service charge has increased over the\nyears, it is understandable that the Applicants might be dissatisfied with\nthe Respondent.\n5. However, for the reasons set out below, we are, in the main, satisfied that\nthe costs comprised within the residential service charge for each year\nwere reasonably incurred by the Respondent landlord and that the works\nand services carried out were of a reasonable standard. There are,\nhowever, some instances were that is not the case.\n6. The reasons for these conclusions are explained in the paragraphs that\nfollow.\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n7. In October 2022, an application was made to the Tribunal under section\n27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) for a\ndetermination of liability to pay and reasonableness of service charges in\nthe respect of the residential parts of the Building. The application\nconcerned the service charge years which ended on 31 March in each\nyear from 2017 to 2022. At the time that the application was made, the\nservice charges for the year 2021-2022 had not been certified. However,\nthey had been certified by the hearing. The Applicants were the long\nleaseholders of 24 of the 35 residential apartments in the Building,\nrepresented by JMW Solicitors LLP. By the time of the final hearing, the\nApplicants were the long leaseholders of 23 of the residential apartments\n(as listed in the Annex hereto), and the Applicants had ceased to instruct\nJMW Solicitors LLP but had instructed Ms Ackerley to represent them\nat the hearing on a direct access basis.\n3\n\n8. In addition, an application has been made for an order under section 20C\nof the 1985 Act preventing the costs incurred by the Respondent in\nconnection with these proceedings from being recovered as part of the\nservice charge, as well as an application for an order under Paragraph 5A\nof Schedule 11 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002\npreventing the costs incurred by the Respondent in connection with\nthese proceedings from being recovered as an administration charge.\n9. The Respondent is Irwell Valley Housing Association Limited, the\nApplicants’ immediate landlord.\n10. The Respondent subsequently made a protective application under s\n20ZA of the 1985 Act on 21 August 2024 (“the s 20Z Application”) for\ndispensation in respect of some additional work undertaken during the\nrelevant service charge years as part of the major works, which s 20ZA\nApplication has been joined to these proceedings to be heard together.\nThe Applicants opted not to file and serve a Statement of Case in\nresponse to the s20ZA Application.\n11. Directions were initially issued on 3 March 2023, and a hearing date was\noriginally listed for 15 April 2024 which was subsequently adjourned.\nCase management hearings took place on 22 August 2024 and 13 May\n2025 and further directions were issued which included permitting the\nparties to rely upon their own expert evidence and to call oral expert\nevidence. Judge Christopher Goodall’s case management note dated 15\nMay 2025 helpfully set out the issues for consideration at the hearing\nwhich were:\na. Major Works\ni. Has R consulted in respect of the major works. If not,\nshould they have dispensation for those works not\nconsulted on;\nii. Do A’s have a claim for historic neglect, if so, what is the\nvalue of that claim;\niii. Does the standard of the major works fall below a\nreasonable standard (s.19 (1) (b)).\nb. General Service Charge\ni. Has R issued proper demands\nii. Has R properly apportioned that SC\nc. Individual Items (s 19 challenges) as per the Schedule of Items in\ndispute\n12. The hearing took place in Manchester over three days on 11, 12 and 13\nNovember 2024. The Applicants were represented at the hearing by Ms\nRebecca Ackerley and the Respondent by Mr Daniel Dovar, both of\ncounsel. We are grateful to both for their assistance in navigating the\nprocedural complexities of this case, and to Mr Dovar for his helpful\nskeleton arguments.\n4\n\n13. We heard oral evidence from the Applicant’s expert Mr Adrian Dawson\nand from the Respondent’s expert Mr Stephen Macey.\n14. In addition to hearing the oral expert evidence and submissions from\ncounsel, we were provided with bundles containing witness statements\nand documentary evidence running into thousands of pages. The\nTribunal did not hear oral evidence from the witnesses but read the\nwitness statements.\n15. The Tribunal inspected the Building on the morning of 11 November,\naccompanied by the parties’ representatives, the parties’ respective\nexperts, by six of the leaseholders and Mr Parlett and Ms Pickup both of\nthe Respondent. The Tribunal did not inspect the basement of the\nBuilding.\n16. Judgment was reserved.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThe Leases\n17. Each of the apartments is demised to its leasehold owner for a term of\n99 years from 1 January 2001, with the Respondent being the current\nlandlord. These residential leases are all in materially the same terms.\n18. The pertinent parts of the service charge provisions contained in the\nLease are as follows:\nClause 2 [to pay] the Service Charge by equal monthly payments in\nadvance on the first day of each month

accordance with sub-clause (4) of this Clause\n7(4) The Service Provision shall consist of a sum comprising-\n7(4)(a) the expenditure estimated by the Surveyor as likely to be\nincurred in the Account Year by the Landlord upon the matters\nspecified in sub-clause (5) of this Clause together with\n7(4)(b) an appropriate amount as a reserve for or towards such of\nthe matters specified in sub-clause (5) as are likely to give rise to\nexpenditure after such Account Year being matters which are likely\nto arise either only once during the then unexpired term of this Lease\nor at intervals of more than one year including (without prejudice\nto the generality of the foregoing) such matters as the decoration of\nthe exterior of the Building (the said amount to be computed in such\nmanner as to ensure as far as is reasonably foreseeable that the\nService Provision shall not fluctuate unduly from year to year) but\n7(4)(c) reduced by any unexpended reserve already made pursuant\nto paragraph (b) of this sub-clause in respect of any such\nexpenditure as aforesaid\n7(5) The relevant expenditure to be included in the Service Provision\nshall comprise all expenditure reasonably incurred by

Charge corresponding to the Service Charge payable under\nthis Lease provide in respect of all such premises a sum equal to the\ntotal that would be payable by the tenants thereof as aforesaid by\nway of contribution to the reserve referred to in paragraph (b) of\nsub-clause ( 4) and the said reserve shall be calculated accordingly\n19. The Respondent’s repairing obligations, as landlord, are set out in clause\n5 (3). These include the obligation to “maintain repair redecorate and\nrenew…the roof…and main structure of the Building and all external\npart”.\nThe Major Works\n20. In March 2017, the Respondent commissioned a report by BWP\nConstruction and Property Consultants (“BWP”) called the Sinking Fund\nReview Report (“the 2017 Report”). The 2017 Report came after an\nearlier report by BWP in 2015 or 2016 (which earlier report was not\navailable to the Tribunal). The purpose of both reports was to undertake\na site survey of the communal areas of the Building to assess the\ncondition of the building fabric and review the sinking fund allocation\nfor planning future budgets. The 2017 Report records (with some\nphotographic evidence) the condition of the Building at that time. Whilst\nsome internal areas are deemed to be in reasonable condition, other\nelements are deemed to be defective including plasterwork and paint\ndecoration to internal wall and ceiling surfaces to west facing elevation,\nrotten timber window frames and boards to west facing elevation,\ninternal wall surfaces within rear staircases affected by water ingress/\ndamp, and damaged plasterwork exposing potentially rotten timber\nlintel to front staircase. Externally, the condition of the brickwork is said\nto be consistent with the age of the property, recording that various areas\n7\n\nof weathered pointing are evident and the brickwork is soiled\nparticularly with algae staining, mis-aligned / disturbed brickwork at\nhigh level to east elevation and vegetation growth, window and door\nframes are soiled and weathered, to the west elevation window frames\nare rotten. The roof was inspected from ground floor level, and the roof\ncovering was found to be in reasonable condition in the main, although\ndisrepair was identified – in particular, pointing to terracotta copings\ncracked, numerous cracked, damaged and slipped slates, indications of\nmovement to coping stone along east elevation, rainwater goods to two\nflat roofs are defective, missing or blocked. It was said that a number of\nmetal rainwater goods were believed to be leaking.\n21. The 2017 Report set out a summary of the cyclical work necessary to\naddress the identified issues with the Building and the budget for those\ncosts for the years from 2017 to 2046. The total cost of the work, over\nthat 29-year period, was over £1.5M.\n22. Towards the end of 2017, the Respondents commenced a consultation\nexercise under s 20 of the 1985 Act for the project management of the\nworks identified by the 2017 Report. Subsequently, the Respondent’s\nconsultant, BWP, commenced a consultation exercise under s 20 in\nrespect of works identified as follows:\na. Isolated roof repairs to pitched roofs where missing/slipped\nslates identified\nb. Repairs to low level flat roofs where ingress currently recorded\nc. External joinery repairs to windows and doors\nd. Full external decoration of all joinery items and metalwork\nincluding windows and doors, railings, car park gates\ne. Removal of all vegetation growth from all brickwork elevations\nf. Isolated re-pointing of brickwork where mortar eroded\ng. Cleaning of all brick elevations removing all staining\nh. Overhauling of rainwater goods including cleaning/rodding of all\ndownpipes and gutters ensuring all are free flowing and re-sealing\nof all joints to eliminate all leaks\ni. Replacement of broken glazing to windows\nj. Reinstatement of external high-level lighting to elevations\n(“the Major Works”).\n23. By the hearing, there was no dispute between the parties that the\nRespondent had complied with its obligations to consult under s 20 of\nthe 1985 Act both in relation to the project management of and in\nrelation to the Major Works.\nThe Additional Works\n24. The Respondents sent the leaseholders an update letter on 13 July 2020\noutlining additional work which had been identified and which the\nRespondents carried out. The additional works included:\n8\n\na. Extensive masonry repairs identified at high level;\nb. Full re-pointing of the elevations to the upper levels whilst the\nscaffolding is in place;\nc. Inclement weather;\nd. Additional scaffolding cost associated with the above.\n(“the Additional Work”)\nPRELIMINARY ISSUES AND APPROACH\n25. Unfortunately, when the case came to the hearing, it was in somewhat\nof a disordered state; there was not a complete set of documents and the\ndocuments received had arrived in a piecemeal fashion. As a result, the\nTribunal needed to make several case management decisions at the\noutset of the hearing.\nBundles of documents\n26. The Tribunal initially had three bundles called “the Final Trial\nBundle_Optimized” (874 pages) (“the Final Bundle”), “the Major Works\nBundle” (82 pages) and “the Leaseholder Bundle” (1321 pages). The first\nbundle had been filed by the Applicants, the latter two by the\nRespondents.\n27. Ms Ackerley raised a number of issues with the bundles. First, that the\nRespondents had not included in their bundles documents (running to\n1900 pages) which the Respondents had disclosed earlier in the\nproceedings (“the Respondent’s Earlier Disclosure”) which included a\ncopy of all the leases for all the leaseholders and all vouchers for each\nservice charge year. Second, the Applicants had omitted to include in\ntheir bundle the exhibits to the witness statements. Third, the\nRespondent’s Major Works Bundle and Leaseholder Bundle contained\nsome new documents, in particular the Major Works Bundle contained\nsome new drawings of the Building showing the major works to be\nundertaken which Mr Dawson had not seen when he prepared his report\n(“the New Drawings”) and the Leaseholder Bundle contained some other\ndocuments which related to other properties and seemed to have been\nincluded in error.\n28. Having heard from Ms Ackerley and Mr Dover on these points, the\nTribunal took a practical approach, using its broad case management\npowers under rule 6 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)\n(Property Chamber) Rules 2013 and having regard to the overriding\nobjective and, in particular, the need to deal with the case\nproportionately, flexibly and to avoid delay, and determined that it\nwould overcome the irregularities in relation to the bundles of\ndocuments as follows so that the case could proceed:\na. The Tribunal would permit the inclusion by the Respondent of the\nNew Drawings in the Major Works Bundle notwithstanding their\n9\n\nlate disclosure on the basis that they will assist the Tribunal and\nthat Mr Dawson would be permitted to comment on the New\nDrawings when he gave evidence so the Applicants would not be\nprejudiced.\nb. In terms of the missing Respondent’s Earlier Disclosure, there\nwas a sample lease contained in the Final Bundle and the Tribunal\ndid not need to see all the leases as it was agreed they were all in\nthe same form. There were some missing documents that would\nbe useful for the Tribunal to have which were the underlying\nvouchers in relation to the outstanding disputed invoices. The\nRespondent would provide them to the Tribunal and Ms Ackerley\nby email.\nc. The parties would send to the Tribunal and each other by email\nthe missing exhibits to the Witness Statements of Giles Parlett\nand Mr McCarthy also.\nThese documents were subsequently sent by email to the Tribunal\nand the respective other party during the hearing.\nNew evidence\n29. There was a late evidence application from the Applicants, to introduce\na new witness statement from Chris Bridgeman, one of the Applicants,\ncontaining details of works (including internal paintwork) undertaken to\nthe Building by the Respondent ahead of the inspection and finished\nonly the Friday before the hearing, and photographs of the condition of\nthe Building prior to that which the Applicants said demonstrated the\nsubstandard nature of the Major Works. It also exhibited a notice of\nintention to undertake further work from the Respondents, which work\nthe Applicants said was similar in description to the Major Works. Mr\nDovar objected.\n30. Having adjourned the hearing briefly to consider both parties'\nsubmissions, the Tribunal determined not to allow this late evidence on\nthe basis that it would not assist the Tribunal. In particular, the\nproceedings were in relation to the service charge for the years 2017-\n2022, and the statement related to events which had occurred\nsubsequently. There was no prejudice to the Applicants who had\nadduced expert evidence as to the standard of the Major Works\nundertaken and had had the opportunity to adduce photographic\nevidence of the condition of the building upon completion of the Major\nWork earlier in the proceedings. It was not relevant that further works\nwere being planned in the future, since there was a cyclical maintenance\nschedule for the Building. Furthermore, it was not in the interests of\njustice nor proportionate to allow the new evidence, which the\nRespondents would necessarily want to respond to, and which would,\ntherefore, if introduced, most likely require the hearing to be adjourned,\ncausing further delay and wasted Tribunal costs.\n31. The Respondent had, with Mr Dovar’s skeleton argument, also\nsubmitted to the Tribunal, the day before the hearing, an updated\n10\n\nversion of the Applicant’s Schedule of Items in dispute, into which the\nRespondent had inserted its responses to the leaseholders’ queries (“the\nUpdated Schedule”). The Respondents had omitted to provide these\nresponses earlier in the proceedings in breach of the directions.\n32. The Tribunal considered whether to permit the Respondent to introduce\nthis late evidence notwithstanding that non-compliance. The Tribunal\ndetermined that it would assist the Tribunal to have this information\nwhich was required for the proper and just determination of the disputed\nissues, and so would permit this late evidence. The Tribunal also had in\nmind proportionality and the low value of the disputed items, in\ncomparison to the Major Works, and the need to find a practical way to\nresolve this matter without further delay. To avoid any prejudice on the\npart of the Applicants, the Tribunal determined that it would permit Ms\nAckerley to raise by email to Mr Dovar overnight any questions or seek\nany clarification in relation to the Respondent’s responses, and to make\nfurther submissions to the Tribunal in respect of those items if required.\nIn the end, Mr Dovar’s responses were adequate, and no further\nsubmissions were required or made by Ms Ackerley.\nApproach\n33. The Tribunal sought clarification from the parties on which of the issues\nidentified for consideration at paragraph 11 above were still at issue and\nhow the Tribunal would resolve them giving the time limits of the\nhearing:\na. S 20ZA Application - Given that the Applicants had not responded\nto the s20ZA Application, Ms Ackerley confirmed that was no\nlonger a live issue between the parties.\nb. Major Works - In terms of the allegation of historic neglect and\nthe standard of the Major Works, the Tribunal agreed that those\nissues could be dealt with together, and that it would make sense\nfor the two experts to give evidence simultaneously (i.e. “hot\ntubbing”) so that they could go through the final account for the\nMajor Works on a line-by-line basis.\nc. General service charge issues - the Tribunal agreed that the\ndemands and apportionment could be addressed in legal\nsubmissions only. This was on the basis that the Tribunal agreed\nthat Ms Ackerley could raise some questions with the Respondent\nvia Mr Dover outside of the hearing by email in relation to the\ndemands, to avoid the need to hear oral evidence from Ms Pickup,\nwhich Ms Ackerley duly did and received responses.\nd. Other items - The Applicants had initially taken what could be\ndescribed as a detailed audit approach to the service charge. The\nScott Schedule in which they originally set out all the individual\ncosts they disputed was 24 pages long. It would not be practicable,\nor proportionate, for the Tribunal to adopt a similar, full audit\n11\n\napproach to the service charges. However, a large majority of\nthose items had been included in the schedule only on the basis\nthat the Applicants disputed the validity of the demands (which\nwould be dealt with as set out above). The parties agreed that the\nremaining outstanding items to be resolved were\ni. the door entry system (which appears on the Updated\nSchedule)\nii. the management fee\niii. the cleaning charges\niv. the responsive repairs carried out in 2021 which the\nApplicants alleged overlapped with the Major Works and\nwere set out in the Updated Schedule.\nIt was agreed that these outstanding items would also be dealt\nwith by legal submissions.\n34. Having adopted that approach, we have framed our decision with\nreference to those headings.\nDemands\n35. The Applicants’ original position was that the demands were defective\nrendering the services charges unrecoverable. However, during closing\nsubmissions, Ms Ackerley accepted that the demands (or subsequent\ncopies of demands served prior to the hearing) complied with the\nstatutory requirements such that the initial allegations raised by the\nApplicants had all been resolved.\n36. The Applicant’s representative sought to introduce, during closing\nsubmissions, a new issue in relation to the demands which was that the\nRespondent had not complied with clause 7 (4) (a) of the Lease in that a\nsurveyor ought to estimate the annual expenditure for the year in\ncalculating the service charge budget. This was an entirely new issue\nwhich had not been raised by the Applicants before closing submissions.\nThe Tribunal considered that the Applicants could have raised this\nmatter at the outset of the proceedings, when they did have the benefit\nof legal representation, and that the fact that they may not have received\nall of the documents from the Respondent until later in the proceedings\nhad not prevented them from raising this point sooner, and that there\nwas no justification for allowing the Applicants to raise this new issue\nnow, which would be to ambush the Respondents. Therefore, the\nTribunal determined that the Applicant could not pursue this new line\nof argument during closing submissions. The outcome of that was that\nMs Ackerley conceded during closing submissions that the validity of the\ndemands was no longer a point being pursued by the Applicants.\nTherefore, the Tribunal was not required to determine that issue in the\nend.\n12\n\nLAW\nRecoverability of service charges\n37. Section 27A(1) of the 1985 Act provides:\nAn application may be made to the appropriate tribunal for a\ndetermination whether a service charge is payable and, if it is, as to–\n(a) the person by whom it is payable,\n(b) the person to whom it is payable,\n(c) the amount which is payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it is payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it is payable.\n38. The Tribunal is “the appropriate tribunal” for these purposes and it has\njurisdiction to make a determination under section 27A of the 1985 Act\nwhether or not any payment has been made.\n39. The meaning of the expression “service charge” is set out in section 18(1)\nof the 1985 Act. It means:\n... an amount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition\nto the rent–\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services,\nrepairs, maintenance, improvements, or insurance or the\nlandlord’s costs of management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to\nthe relevant costs.\n40. In making any determination under section 27A, the Tribunal must have\nregard to section 19 of the 1985 Act, subsection (1) of which provides:\nRelevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the amount of\na service charge payable for a period-\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the\ncarrying out of works, only if the services or works are of a\nreasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.\n41. “Relevant costs” are defined for these purposes by section 18(2) of the\n1985 Act as:\nthe costs or estimated costs incurred or to be incurred by or on behalf of\nthe landlord, or a superior landlord, in connection with the matters for\nwhich the service charge is payable.\n42. There is no presumption for or against the reasonableness of the\nstandard of works or services, or of the reasonableness of the amount of\ncosts as regards service charges. If a tenant argues that the standard or\nthe costs of the service are unreasonable, they will need to specify the\nitem complained of and the general nature of their case. However, the\n13\n\ntenant need only put forward sufficient evidence to show that the\nquestion of reasonableness is arguable. Then it is for the landlord to meet\nthe tenant’s case with evidence of its own. The Tribunal then decides on\nthe basis of the evidence put before it.\nS 20 consultation and dispensation\n43. S.20 of the Act provides for the limitation of service charges if the\nstatutory consultation requirements are not met. The consultation\nrequirements apply where the works are qualifying works (as in this\ncase) and only £250 can be recovered from a tenant in respect of such\nworks unless the consultation requirements have either been complied\nwith or dispensed with.\n44. Dispensation is dealt with by s.20ZA of the Act which provides:-\n\"Where an application is made to a leasehold valuation tribunal for a\ndetermination to dispense with all or any of the consultation\nrequirements in relation to any qualifying works or qualifying long\nterm agreement, the tribunal may make the determination if satisfied\nthat it is reasonable to dispense with the requirements\"\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nS 20ZA Application\n45. Given that the Applicants failed to respond to the s 20ZA Application\nand, therefore, have not provided any evidence of prejudice in respect of\nthe Additional Works, Ms Ackerley acknowledged at the hearing that this\nwas no longer a live issue. The Tribunal does not need to consider\nwhether the Additional Works came within the scope of the Major Work.\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that, as the s 20ZA Application is uncontested\nand there is no suggestion of prejudice, it is reasonable to dispense with\nthe consultation requirements in respect of the Additional Work insofar\nas they were not included within the scope of the consultation for the\nMajor Works.\nMajor Works – Historic Neglect and Standard of Works\n46. The allegations made by the Applicants in relation to the Major Works\ncarried out in 2019 and 2020 can be summarised as follows:\na. The Applicants allege that the Building was in disrepair and that\nthe Respondent’s breach of the Lease led to the deterioration of\nthe condition of the Building and to an increase in the cost of\nrepair; and\nb. In terms of some of the items of the Major Works carried out, the\nApplicants either dispute that the work was carried out at all or\nthat the work was a reasonable standard.\n14\n\n47. As set out above, the Tribunal heard from the parties’ respective experts\nsimultaneously; they went through the final account for the Major Works\non a line-by-line basis, dealing with the allegations in terms of historic\nneglect and the standard of the work as they went along.\n48. The final account for the Major Works in Mr Dawon’s report was stated\nto be £338,590.41. Of that, Mr Dawson concluded in his report that\n£247,715.12 was not chargeable to the leaseholders, meaning that\n£90,875.29 was not disputed.\n49. Mr Macey’s report gave a lower figure for the final account of\n£328,839.98 which was not explained. As Mr Macey is the Respondent’s\nexpert, the Tribunal has taken this as the correct starting point. In his\nreport, Mr Macey agreed that deductions of £30,259.97 net of VAT\nshould be made from the final account based upon £23,534.35 of works\nwhich he found to have been ineffective, together with proportionate\nadjustments to the preliminaries and scaffolding costs of £6,725.63. In\naddition, the contingency sum of £5000 was excluded entirely.\n50. During evidence, Mr Macey said that having now seen the New\nDrawings (which he said he had not been provided with when he\nproduced his report) he considered that his conceded reductions were\ngenerous and that some areas of work he had discounted had in fact been\ncompleted. The Tribunal considered that it was for the Respondent to\nhave provided its own expert with the New Drawings at the relevant time\nand, in the absence of Mr Macey having seen those drawings, his report\nhad been prepared based upon his visual inspection of the Building.\nTherefore, the Tribunal did not think it would be reasonable to permit\nMr Macey to revisit the deductions he had made in his report. Rather,\nthe Tribunal accepted the concessions which Mr Macey made\nin the sum of £30,259.97 plus £5000 in respect of the\ncontingency as its starting point and determined that those\namounts had not been reasonably incurred and are not\npayable.\nGeneral approach to Historic Neglect\n51. Mr Dawson’s principal argument is that, in his expert opinion, had the\nBuilding been inspected and maintained on a regular basis, most of the\ncosts would not have been incurred by the Respondent. He said that\ngeneral regular inspection and maintenance of the water maintenance\nsystem would have picked up issues earlier and would have avoided the\nsignificant issues arising down the line because of long-term water\ningress. In his report, Mr Dawson quantified the cost of the regular\n(twice annual) inspections of the Building at £6000 plus VAT (albeit he\ndid not reflect that amount in his final account).\n52. Mr Macey’s opinion was that this was a timing issue only; the fact that\nthe work was done later does not impact the cost. The costs of\nmaintenance would still have existed if the work was carried out at an\nearlier date. If the works had been carried out earlier on a one-off basis,\n15\n\nMr Macey said that it would not have saved costs due to economies of\nscale. In Mr Macey’s opinion, had it been done earlier, it may have cost\nmore.\n53. Mr Dovar referred the Tribunal to the case of Daejan Properties v\nGriffith [2014] UKUT 206 (LC) and paragraphs 88 and 89 which states:\n88. As the Lands Tribunal …explained in Continental Ventures v\nWhite [2006] 1 EGLR 85 an allegation of historic neglect does not\ntouch on the question posed by s 19 (1) (a), Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985, namely, whether the costs of remedial work have been\nreasonably incurred and so are capable of forming part of the\nrelevant costs to be included in a service charge. The question of\nwhat the cost of repair is does not depend on whether the repairs\nought to have been allowed to accrue. The reasonableness of\nincurring the cost of remedial work cannot depend on how the need\nfor a remedy arose.\n89. The only route by which an allegation of historic neglect may\nprovide a defence to a claim for service charges is if it can be\nshown that, but for the failure by the landlord to make good a\ndefect at the time required by its covenant, part of the cost\neventually incurred in remedying that defect, or the whole of the\ncost of remedying consequential defects would have been avoided.\nIn those circumstances the tenant to whom the repairing\nobligation was owed has a claim in damages for breach of\ncovenant, and that claim may be set off against the same tenant’s\nliability to contribute through the service charge to the cost of the\nremedial work. The damages which the tenant could claim, and the\ncorresponding set off available in such case, is comprised of two\nelements: first, the amount by which the cost of remedial work has\nincreased as a result of the landlord’s failure to carry out the work\nat the earliest time it was obliged to do so; and, secondly…general\ndamages…if the demised premises were affected by the landlord’s\nbreach of covenant.”\nThe second element is not relevant to this case.\n54. Mr Dovar submitted that Mr Dawson’s approach overlooked accounting\nfor the cost of work which would have had to be carried out in any event\nincluding actual maintenance of the rainwater goods, items above the\nrainwater goods such as ridge and roof tiles, and the cost of general\nmaintenance. Mr Dawson had not provided any cost for that work and\nMr Macey said that the costs would not have changed. Furthermore,\nwhilst Mr Dawson accepted the £62,468.50 for access costs (initial\nscaffolding), he had not appreciated that economies of scale meant that\na landlord would not incur that cost to remove a small amount of\nvegetation. The cost of maintenance such as removing vegetation,\ncleaning brickwork and fixing high up items was in fact the cost of\ngaining access.\n16\n\n55. Ms Ackerley accepted Daejan Properties v Griffith set out the correct\ntest to be applied in relation to set off for historic neglect. However, she\nsubmitted that the broad repairing obligation on the Respondent here\nplaced an obligation on the Respondent to proactively maintain the\nBuilding, rather than simply repair the Building when it fell into\ndisrepair, and that, in the absence of evidence from the Respondents that\nthey were carrying out regular inspections / maintenance since the\nconversion, the Applicant’s position was that the work which had been\nundertaken would not have been required to have been carried out at all\nif regular inspections and maintenance had been carried out. Ms\nAckerley invited the Tribunal to reflect Mr Dawson’s estimate of £6000\nplus VAT for a twice annual inspection in the amount it found payable.\n56. It was not disputed that the Respondent had been in breach of covenant\nin relation to its repairing obligations although it is not clear when that\nfirst arose. The Tribunal considered that it did not need to determine the\ncause of the issues with the Building (whether water ingress or\ncondensation or otherwise) nor to determine when the Respondent was\nfirst in breach of its repairing obligation in this instance. Given the test\nset out in Daejan Properties v Griffith, the crucial question was whether\nthe Applicants had shown that the cost of the work had increased\nbecause of the Respondent’s failure to carry out the work at the earliest\ntime it was obliged to do so (or indeed at an earlier time).\n57. The Tribunal found, on the evidence before it, that it was more likely\nthan not that the costs which the Respondent would have incurred in\nundertaking earlier inspections / maintenance work over the years\nwould have been broadly equivalent to or greater than those incurred on\nthe Major Works in any event. The Tribunal made that finding on the\nfollowing basis:\na. The Tribunal considered it is reasonable and common for\nlandlords to factor in economies of scale, and this included the\nsignificant and potentially disproportionate cost of obtaining,\nsafely, access to high up areas of buildings. Whilst Mr Dawson had\nmade a comment in evidence that a cherry picker could have been\nused, the Applicants had neither provided any evidence to\nsubstantiate that claim nor any costings. Therefore, in the\nabsence of evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal accepted Mr\nMacey’s evidence that scaffolding would have been required at\nleast on some occasions to inspect and maintain the higher areas\nof the Building and, on the basis of the Respondent’s costs, those\ncosts would easily have become disproportion to the cost of the\nwork undertaken and could have accumulated, over the years, to\na cost in excess of that being disputed now;\nb. The Tribunal did not accept the Applicant’s assertion that, had\nregular inspections been undertaken, that would have avoided the\nneed for carrying out any of the work. There would inevitably have\nbeen some work required to remedy issues found on inspection\nand the Applicants had not allocated any costings for such\n17\n\nmaintenance. Therefore, insofar as part of the cost might have\nbeen avoided, the Applicants had not provided a reliable figure by\nwhich such savings could be assessed. Furthermore, the Tribunal\nconsidered that any building (and particularly one of the age and\ncharacter of the Building) would require some more significant\ncyclical repairs to the fabric of the Building over time and these\nwere likely to be of significant cost (based upon the Respondent’s\ncostings).\nc. The costing provided by the Applicants of £6000 for twice yearly\ninspections was an estimate only. Furthermore, it did not include\na breakdown and did not include any maintenance / repair costs\nnor access costs and so was of very limited value.\n58. In light of the above finding, the Applicants did not satisfy the test in\nDaejan Properties v Griffith; they have not demonstrated that part of the\ncost eventually incurred in remedying the disrepair, or the whole of the\ncost of remedying the disrepair, would have been avoided by the\nRespondent carrying out the work or inspecting the Building earlier.\nTherefore, the Applicants do not have a claim in damages which they are\nentitled to set off against the service charge. Furthermore, even if the\nApplicants had made out a potential claim in respect of part of the costs,\nthe Applicants also failed to evidence an amount by which the cost of\nremedial work increased as a result of the landlord’s failure to carry out\nthe work sooner. Therefore, the Tribunal is not willing or able to\nmake a set off against the Applicants’ service charge liability\nbased on alleged historic neglect.\nCovid / furlough items\n59. A significant proportion of the sum disputed by Mr Dawson related to\nwhat was termed “Covid” or “furlough”. These were listed in the final\naccount under the headings “Additional Prelims”, “Additional Scaffold\nHire” and “Additional Scaffold Hire (COVID-19 Lockdown Period) and\namounted to £74,454.07 of costs in total which Mr Dawson had\ndiscounted in his report on the basis that these “costs would have been\ncovered by government furlough and grant payments, do not form part\nof service charge costs”.\n60. In evidence, Mr Dawson expanded on his rationale, saying that, in his\nexperience, sites were not charged for scaffolding and plant hire during\nlockdown periods because the equipment couldn’t be used elsewhere,\nand that grants were also available beyond the lockdown period when\nrestrictions were still in place. He also referred to employers obtaining\nbounce back loans.\n61. In contrast, Mr Macey said that whilst government schemes were in\nplace at the time, the items in the final account, which had been signed\noff, told him that employees were still working on the site, at a distance,\nalbeit things had to be done differently during that time. The discount\n18\n\nthat was agreed was likely the outcome of negotiations when that was\nnot possible.\n62. Ms Ackerly in closing submissions argued that the Respondents could\nhave produced evidence of negotiations for the reduction if that was the\ncase, and that, in the absence of evidence, there might have been other\nreasons for the reduction being given.\n63. Having considered the final account, the Tribunal is satisfied that only a\nsmall number of the items listed under these headings related to the\nCovid lockdown period. Those are:\na. NV P2 which refers to “site shutdown period, following\ngovernment COVID-19 guidelines” for the period 27/03/2020-\n05/06/2020 during which the charge for additional preliminary\ncosts is specified as 10 weeks @ £287.50 (which appears to be a\nsignificant reduction from the cost of £1,550.41 per week\nattributable to the other items listed under that heading);\nb. NV Sc8, NV Sc9 and NV Sc10, all of which are listed under the\nspecific heading “Additional Scaffold Hire (COVID-19 Lockdown\nPeriod)” and refer to additional scaffold hire for the gable\nelevation for the period wc 30/03/2020-wc 01/06/2020, 10\nweeks @ £358.80, additional scaffold hire to front elevation for\nthe period w/c 30/03/2020 – wc 01/06/2020, 10 weeks @\n£652.50 and additional scaffold hire to gable elevation (left\nsection) for period wc 30/03/2020- wc 01/06/2020, 10 weeks @\n35% £365.10. These costs do not differ from the costs incurred for\nthe scaffolding of the same areas during different weeks.\n64. The Respondent said that the work halted in March 2020 and resumed\nin July 2020, and the dates specified in those entries above broadly\ncorrespond with that description and the first lockdown in relation to\nCovid.\n65. It seems to the Tribunal that Mr Dawson erred in assuming that all the\ncosts in these sections related to the Covid period simply because some\nof the costs related to (and expressly refer to) the Covid lockdown period.\nRather, the Tribunal considers it more likely than not that most of the\ncosts under these headings were simply what they said they were;\nadditional preliminary and additional scaffolding costs necessitated by\nthe project and incurred in addition to the original budget.\n66. In relation to those costs that were incurred during the Covid lockdown\nperiod (as set out above), it appears to the Tribunal that a reduction in\ncosts was put in place in respect of the additional preliminary costs\nduring the 10-week period of 27/03/2020 to 05/06/2020. The\nRespondents have not provided any evidence as to how that reduction\nwas achieved whether by contractual negotiation or actual reduced costs\nor otherwise. However, the Tribunal did not consider that the\nResponded needed to. In the absence of any specific evidence that other\n19\n\ncost savings means were available, Mr Dawson’s broad comment that\nthese costs (and the other costs under this heading) would have been\ncovered by government furlough and grant payments was mere\nspeculation. The Applicants have put forward no evidence to\nseriously question the reasonableness of the charges under\nthis section, and the Tribunal finds that these costs were\nreasonably incurred and are payable.\nPreliminaries\n67. The final account includes “Preliminaries” in the sum of £23,036.65. Mr\nDawson’s position was that these should be excluded because the\nRespondents had provided no further breakdown as to what these\nrelated to and because preliminaries usually include scaffolding costs\nbut those have been specified elsewhere in the account. Mr Macey’s\nconsidered that it was likely that the scaffolding costs had been specified\nseparately because it was such a large item, but maintained that there\nwould be other overheads which always make up preliminaries on any\nsite, and that the figure of £23,036.65 seemed right given that it was\nroughly 10% of the total costs (albeit Mr Macey had adjusted the\npreliminaries to account for the ineffective costs as set out above).\n68. The Tribunal did not accept Mr Dawson’s position that the preliminaries\nshould be excluded in their entirety because no further breakdown had\nbeen provided, and because the scaffolding costs had been accounted for\nelsewhere. Even without the scaffolding costs, the site would have had\nother costs which would be classified as preliminaries. The Tribunal\nconsidered that the term “preliminaries” was a standard term in\nconstruction, and it was understood what sorts of costs were included in\nthat description. The Applicants had not provided an alternative figure.\nIn contrast, Mr Macey’s expert opinion was that the figure was an\nappropriate one for a project of this size. The Tribunal accepted that\nevidence and determined that the preliminaries in the sum of\n£23,036.65 had been reasonably incurred and were payable\n(subject to the adjustment which the Tribunal has made to the\npreliminaries below).\nAdjustments\n69. These are the Additional Works which the Respondent carried out (as\ndiscussed above).\n70. Mr Dawson’s approach in respect all items from AI 1.1 – AI 7.5, work\ntotalling £51,51,140.65, is first, this work should have been included in\nthe original work package and, second, that all items have been caused\nby the historic neglect and would not have been required but for that\nneglect, such that he costed them at £0.\n71. Ms Ackerley accepted, in closing submissions, that these were variations\nto the contract and the first point was not a valid one.\n20\n\n72. Therefore, the Tribunal has considered these items with reference to the\ngeneral positions put forward by the parties in relation to the historic\nneglect. As set out above, and for the same reasons, the Applicants have\nnot demonstrated to the Tribunal that the cost of the remedial work\n(which includes the Additional Work) has increased because of the\nRespondent’s failure to carry out the work or inspect earlier.\nFurthermore, the Applicants have not evidenced a figure by which it\ncould be said to have increased either. Therefore, the Tribunal is not\nwilling or able to make a set off against the Applicants’ service\ncharge liability for the additional work based on the historic\nneglect claimed.\n73. Mr Macey had, however, made deductions in his report to\nsome of these costs in recognition of ineffective work which\nthe Tribunal has already determined are not payable.\nMAJOR WORKS – STANDARD OF WORK – S 19\nGable Elevation overlooking car park\n74. Having now seen the New Drawings, Mr Dawson took the view that there\nwas no evidence that a number of items at 4.02.1, 4.02.2 and 4.02.6\n(relating to rake out and repointing work) totalling £4,337.17 had been\ncarried out (which he said he would have queried had he had sight of the\nNew Drawings at the time he produced his report). These items were not\nlisted on the New Drawings and so, Mr Dawson said, there was no\nevidence that the work had been undertaken.\n75. Mr Macey acknowledged that the New Drawings did not show this work\nand, further, that he could not say with certainty exactly what work was\ndone and where: he was relying on his visual inspection, the drawings he\nhad seen, and the contract administrator having undertaken its role.\n76. The Tribunal considered that the Applicants had raised sufficient doubt\nas to whether these items had been carried out, and the Respondent had\nfailed to address that doubt adequately. The Respondent’s New\nDrawings did not demonstrate that the work had been undertaken, and\nMr Macey himself acknowledged that he could not say with certainty that\nit had. It was not adequate simply to say that the Respondent relied upon\nthe final account having been signed off, or that Mr Dawson had visually\ninspected the Building. The Tribunal preferred the Applicant’s\nposition and found, as a fact, that the disputed items of work\nhad not been undertaken. Therefore, the cost of £4337.17 had\nnot been reasonably incurred and is not payable, and that sum\nshould be deducted from the final account.\nRear Elevation- Ivy\n21\n\n77. There was a dispute as to whether the ivy at the rear elevation and on the\nrailings had been removed effectively. Items 5.01.0 and 5.01.08 related\nto this.\n78. Mr Dawson said that the ivy had not been removed effectively; he had\npointed out during the inspection that ivy was still present on the\nrailings, and he said that would not be the case had it been removed\neffectively the first time. Furthermore, he said that the ivy that had been\non the rear elevation had been the same plant, from the same source, and\nso would grow back in future on the basis it had not been removed fully.\n79. Mr Macey conceded that if there was ivy currently present on the railings\nthen the root system may not have been dealt with adequately. However,\nno ivy was present on the rear elevation, and he queried whether it was\nthe same plant and whether it was of the invasive variety.\n80. The Tribunal clearly saw the ivy present on the railings during\nthe inspection and so, on that basis, found that the treatment\nof that issue had not been dealt with adequately such that item\n5.01.8 in the sum of £455 should be excluded as that work had\nnot been carried out to a reasonable standard and was not\npayable.\n81. The Applicant had produced no evidence, however, that the ivy which\nhad been present on the rear elevation had come from the same plant /\nsource, nor was there evidence that that ivy had regrown. Therefore,\nthe Tribunal found, as a fact, that the work to that plant had\nbeen properly carried out and, therefore, to a reasonable\nstandard, such that the sum charged for item 5.01.0 was\npayable.\nRoof Works\n82. Item 5.03.3 is for the sum of £4,777.50 and states “re-bed all ridge tiles\nto the roof, sand, cement and mortar”. Mr Dawson understood this to\nmean that all the ridge tiles to the roof should have been rebedded, which\nhe said had not been undertaken (from a visual inspection) and, further,\nthat over pointing was seen to have failed in several locations.\n83. Mr Macey’s view was that it can never have been intended to re-bed\nliterally all the tiles, since that would have costed far more than circa\n£5000. The cost of circa £5000 was in line with the work which had been\nundertaken, which was to re-bed the tiles as necessary. Mr Macey\nconceded that there was some erosion of the over pointing and\nquantified that at 20% of the cost, being £955.50.\n84. The Tribunal noted that the original specification for the Major Works\nstated, “Isolated roof repairs to pitched roofs where missing/slipped\nslates identified”. This was consistent with Mr Macey’s version of events.\nMr Macey’s evidence that £5000 was an appropriate amount for such\nisolated roof repairs, and that the cost of re-bedding the whole of what\n22\n\nwas a very large roof would have been much more, seemed very\nplausible. Therefore, the Tribunal preferred the Respondent’s\nposition and found, as a fact, that the cost of £4,777.50 was for\nthe rebedding of some ridge tiles (not literally all ridge tiles)\nand that that work had been undertaken to a reasonable\nstandard, such that the charge was payable (save for the\n£955.50 already discounted by the Respondent).\nFront Elevation – removal of vegetation and cleaning\n85. Mr Dawson challenged whether items 6.01.2, 6.01.3, 6.01.5, 6.01.6,\n6.01.7, 6.01.8 and 6.01.9 had been carried out since they were missing\nfrom the New Drawings.\n86. Mr Macey pointed out that there had been no charge for 6.01.6 and\n6.01.7. He had already made a partial concession in respect of these\nworks in the sum of £2751.58.\n87. The Respondent had not been able to explain the absence of these works\nfrom the New Drawings. However, unlike in the case of the repointing\nabove, some of this work was work which was quite significant in nature\nand could have been seen easily from a visual inspection. However, Mr\nDawson had not challenged whether that work had been done in his\nreport. Items which would have been visible on inspection being 6.01.03\n“Clean down all brick work and remove all staining to all areas”\n£7,452.90 and 6.01.5 “Undertake full clean of all glazing units to the\nelevation” £3,460.28 were quite significant in nature. The Tribunal\nconsidered that Mr Dawson would surely have queried the completion\nof that work in his report if it had been evident at the inspection that that\nwork had not been carried out. Therefore, the Tribunal found, as a\nfact, that those works had been carried out notwithstanding\nthat they did not appear on the New Drawings, such that they\nare payable.\n88. In terms of the other disputed items, it was possible that Mr Dawson\nhad not been able to fully observe those on a higher level visually and,\nhad he seen the New Drawings, he might have reconsidered whether\nthose had been carried out. However, the total cost of those items\nwas significantly less than the £2,751.58 deducted by Mr\nMacey already, and so the Tribunal did not need to determine\nwhether those items had been completed since the\nRespondent’s deduction already covered the cost of that work.\nFront Elevation – Building Work\n89. Mr Dawson says Items 6.02.5 and 6.02.6 were not completed because\nthey do not appear on the New Drawings. These both relate to extensive\nrake out and repointing work, to all feature brick window cills and the\nheads and joints of all feature brick plinths top head of the ground, first\nand second window floor. This made up nearly £6000 of costs.\n23\n\n90. Mr Macey in his report has made deduction of £1,077.77 to account for\nsome failure in pointing work.\n91. Again, Mr Dawson did not raise the issue of the work having not been\ncarried out in his report. Again, the Tribunal considers that this work\nwould have been evident on visual inspection as it is not all high level.\nTherefore, the Tribunal makes a finding of fact that this work\nwas carried out, and the cost is payable save for the £1,077.77\nalready conceded by Respondents.\nGeneral dispute in relation to mortar type\n92. A dispute existed in relation to the standard of the repointing work\nbecause of the mortar mix used. The total repointing work amounted to\naround £60,ooo of work in total, although the dispute arose from the\ndescription given at item AI 11.2 of the final account, the repointing of\nthe upper section of gable elevation overlooking the car park for\n£7,963.20. The description on the final account stated, “Mix 1:1:6\ncement hydrated lime, sand”.\n93. The experts gave significant technical testimony on this matter, but in\nsummary, their respective positions were as follows:\na. Mr Dawson said that a mortar containing cement was not suitable\nfor repointing the brickwork at the Building, and so the work\ncarried out had not been effective and, therefore, to a reasonable\nstandard. Mr Dawson also queried whether the old mortar had\nbeen raked out sufficiently;\nb. Mr Macey said that the mortar was a mix which contained cement\nat an acceptable level, was entirely appropriate, that the\ncontractor was experienced, and the fact that this detail was\nspecified in the final account demonstrated that it had been\nconsidered. Further, there was no evidence of inadequate\npointing; if it had been ineffective, it would have fallen out.\n94. Mr Macey had made some deductions, in his report, for areas where he\nhad accepted (at that time) that repointing had not been carried out.\nHowever, that did not mean that the standard of the repointing which\nwas carried out was ineffective. Whilst noting Mr Dawson’s expert\nopinion on the mortar, it was based upon a sentence in the final report\nonly and the Applicants had not obtained nor presented any evidence as\nto the actual make-up of the mortar and its alleged unsuitability.\nFurthermore, even if there was a theoretical issue with the mortar make\nup, the Tribunal would need to be satisfied that the work had been\ndefective. The Tribunal did not consider that there was adequate\nevidence that the repointing carried out was ineffective; during its\ninspection, the Tribunal observed that the repointing looked to be in\nreasonable order. Therefore, in the absence of evidence as to the\nunsuitability of the mortar and, in particular, the\nineffectiveness of the work as a whole, the Tribunal preferred\n24\n\nMr Macey’s evidence and found, as a fact, that the mortar was\nof a suitable specification and that the repointing work had\nbeen effective and to a reasonable standard such that the costs\nassociated with it are payable. Therefore, the Tribunal did not\nmake any deductions to the cost of the repointing generally\n(save for the exceptions set out elsewhere in this\ndetermination).\nConclusions in relation to final account\n95. In addition to Mr Macey’s deductions of £23,534.35, the\nTribunal has determined that a further £4,792.17 should be\nremoved from the final account as it is not payable. That gives\na total of £28,326.52 deductions plus the contingency of\n£5000.\n96. Mr Macey also made a proportionate adjustment to the\npreliminaries and scaffolding costs on account of the\nreduction in overall costs. Having accepted Mr Macey’s\napproach as a starting position, the Tribunal considers that\nthis is an appropriate adjustment and adopts a similar\napproach. The Tribunal finds that a proportionate adjustment\nof 8.75% should be applied to those figures meaning that the\nfollowing sums should be deducted on the basis they have not\nbeen reasonably incurred and are not payable:\nPreliminaries: £2,015.71\nAdditional Preliminaries: £3,356.54\nScaffolding: £2,801.26\n97. In total, therefore, the Tribunal finds that £41,500.03 should\nbe deducted from the final account for the Major Works, and\nthat the remaining costs which make up the final account are\nreasonable and payable.\nGeneral service charge issues\nApportionment – Commercial Unit\n98. In relation to “the commercial unit” in the basement, there is no dispute\nthat it had never been developed or let as a commercial unit. The\nRespondent has taken an inconsistent approach over the years in dealing\nwith it in relation to the service charge. Some years it had included the\nunit in its calculation and had divided the Service Provision (or part of\nit) between 36 (i.e. the 35 residential units plus the commercial unit).\nOther years, the Respondent had excluded the commercial unit and\ndivided the Service Provision between the 35 residential units only.\n99. Clause 7(1)(b) of the Lease sets out that the \"Specified Proportion\" (the\nproportion payable by means leaseholder) means “a reasonable\n25\n\nproportion of the Service Provision such proportion to be determined\nfrom time to time by the Landlord as being attributable to the Premises”\n(underlined for emphasis). Therefore, the Respondent had discretion\nunder the Lease to decide what proportion of the Service Provision to\nallocate to each of the leaseholders, which included deciding how to\napproach the commercial unit in that calculation, albeit that the\nRespondent was required to act “reasonably” in exercising that\ndiscretion.\n100. The Applicant’s position, set out in their Statement of Case and Reply,\ncan be summarised as a “reasonable proportion” would be a proportion\nof the cost of the service charge that reflects a contribution from the\ncommercial unit, which unit enjoys the benefit of repairs and\nmaintenance to the Building and that the inclusion of the commercial\nunit would reflect an equitable proportionate split. The Applicants\nfurther questioned the reasonableness of the Respondent’s approach\ngiven the inconsistent way it has approached the commercial unit.\n101. Mr Dovar directed the Tribunal to the case of Bradley v Abacus [2025]\nEWCA Civ 1308, a recent Court of Appeal decision which considered how\nthe Tribunal was to approach a similar discretion on the part of a\nlandlord to apportion a service charge at a “fair and reasonable\nproportion”, and, in particular, paragraph 79 of that decision which\nsuggests the test to apply as follows\n“the role of the FTT is limited to deciding whether a landlord has acted\nin breach of contract; that a landlord will only have acted in breach of\ncontract if the decision it has made was not one open to it in the\ncircumstances; and that where the lease requires the landlord to act\nreasonably or exercise reasonable discretion, that will only be so if the\ndecision is one that no reasonable landlord could have reached”.\n102. In closing submissions, Ms Ackerley referred to correspondence in\nwhich it had been raised that the Respondent had previously calculated\nthe apportionment on a square footage basis. However, insofar as the\nApplicants sought a return to a square footage basis, Ms Ackerley\nacknowledged that square footages had not been provided and so that\ncould not be put forward.\n103. The Tribunal had some sympathy with the Applicants on this issue. It\nseemed a contradiction for the Respondent on the one hand to exclude\nthe commercial unit on the basis there was no physical unit and no lease,\nbut on the other hand to include the commercial unit in its\napportionment of the service charge some years. However, the Tribunal\nconsidered that the approach set out in Bradley v Abacus was the correct\none for it to take; the Respondent had discretion under the terms of the\nLease and the Tribunal’s role was to decide whether a landlord had acted\nin breach of contract which, in this case, would require the course of\naction to be one which no reasonable landlord could have reached.\n26\n\n104. The Tribunal determined that it was not unreasonable for a landlord to\nhave reached the decision to exclude the commercial unit from its\napportionment on the basis that the unit was not just unlet but had not\neven been physically developed.\n105. Similarly, it was not unreasonable for a landlord to have reached the\ndecision to include the commercial unit either.\n106. The fact that the Respondent had done both at different times was\ninconsistent. However, the fact that it had adopted an inconsistent\napproach did not make its approach unreasonable, in the Tribunal’s\nview, and it had in fact benefitted the Applicants in the sense that they\nhad paid a lower contribution where the commercial unit had been\nincluded than they would have done if the commercial unit had been\nexcluded every year.\n107. The Tribunal found that the Respondent was reasonable in\nits approach and was entitled, under the terms of the Lease, to\napproach the apportionment in respect of the commercial unit\nin the way that it had done.\nOther items\nManagement fee\n108. Although the Applicants had initially challenged the recoverability of\nsuch a fee under the terms of the Lease, the Applicants accepted that was\nnot an issue at the hearing. Therefore, the only issue was the amount of\nthe management fee and whether it was reasonable given the standard\nof services provided.\n109. In relation to the management fees charged, the Applicants alleged that\nthe management had been inadequate; the Respondent’s\nmismanagement and lack of proactive response had allowed the\nBuilding to fall into a state of disrepair, resulting in significant water\ningress which had damaged several individual apartments. The\nApplicants had sent numerous complaints to the Respondent over the\nyears, the Respondent’s communication was poor, there was a lack of\ntransparency, and the Applicants are unclear what exactly they were\ngetting for their money.\n110. The Respondent’s position is that the management fee covers all the\nusual management tasks including arranging insurance, sorting out\ncleaners, paying bills, reacting to issues raised by leaseholders etc. In\naddition, during the years in question, the Respondent had undertaken\nwork planning the Major Works programme including dealing with the\ns 20 consultation. The issues raised by the Applicants in terms of the\nstandard of management received was just one aspect of the\nmanagement function and does not warrant a reduction in the fees.\n27\n\n111. The Tribunal considers that the management fees charged are not high\nones. Furthermore, the Tribunal acknowledges that the charges will\ninclude a host of work which the Respondent has undertaken in terms of\nthe management of the Building, as well as the more significant work\nassociated with dealing with the Major Works. However, it is not\nnecessary (nor would it be proportionate) for the Tribunal to consider\nindividual complaints made by the Applicant and whether they were\nresponded to by the Respondent in a timely fashion to reach the\nconclusion that the Building has been mismanaged. That is self-evidence\nfrom the fact that the Building was allowed to get into such a state of\ndisrepair, to the extent that damage was caused to individual\napartments. Furthermore, there has clearly been issues on the part of the\nRespondent in communication and transparency since much of the\ndocumentation and other clarificatory information were only provided\nto the Applicants during these proceedings, and some of it late.\nTherefore, the Tribunal accepts the Applicant’s evidence and finds as a\nfact that a proportion of the management function carried out by the\nRespondent has not been of a reasonable standard.\n112. The Respondents calculated the amount of the management fees (to\ninclude all the work carried out), and the Applicants are entitled to\nexpect the service provided to be of a reasonable standard. It cannot be\nsaid by the Respondent now that, even discounting a proportion of the\nservices which may not have been up to standard, the overall amount of\nwork done at a reasonable standard is sufficient to justify the fee in full.\n113. As no further breakdown of the management fees has been\nprovided, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to take a\npractical, broadbrush approach and has determined that 30%\nof the management fees for each year which is the subject of\nthis application should be deducted on the basis that it broadly\ncorresponds with the estimated proportion of the service/\nwork not to a reasonable standard. The Tribunal considers\nthat this proportion takes account of the mismanagement and\npoor service provided by the Respondent whilst\nacknowledging that significant other tasks were undertaken\nby the Respondent to a reasonable standard, such that 70% of\nthe management fees for each year which is the subject of this\napplication are reasonable and payable.\nCleaning charges\n114. The Applicants had two concerns in relation to the cleaning charges.\nFirst, that they had not seen evidence of general cleaning being carried\nout at the Building (for example, a failure to mop up leaked water in a\ntimely fashion) and, second, that the cost of the cleaning had been\nexacerbated by the disrepair at the Building and water ingress, for\nexample, by requiring additional cleaning to carpets due to stains and\ncleaning of woodwork. In closing submissions, Ms Ackerley said that,\nwhilst the Applicants acknowledged that there would have been some\n28\n\ncleaning undertaken by the Respondents, there should be some discount\nto reflect the issues raised.\n115. The Respondents said that since 2013 or 2014, J Morson Cleaning\nServices had provided a good service. The Respondents had provided a\nschedule of the routine cleaning undertaken. In 2021, a new company\nwas appointed but, after a few months, that contract was terminated due\nto poor service, and a new cleaner was brought in whom, the Respondent\nsaid, is performing satisfactorily.\n116. The Tribunal considered the schedule of routine work undertaken by J\nMorson Cleaning Services until they were replaced in 2021. The Tribunal\nconsidered that it was evidence that cleaning was undertaken three days\na week, and that more significant cleaning tasks were undertaken\nquarterly, six monthly and annually. This included a “steam clean” of\ncarpet quarterly and cleaning woodwork / window frames quarterly.\nWhilst acknowledging that J Morson Cleaning Services had been\nreplaced some time in 2021, and that there had been a period of a few\nmonths when the replacement service was not adequate, the Tribunal\nconsidered it was reasonable to assume that the new cleaners had\nundertaken similar tasks at a similar regularity to J Morson Cleaning\nServices.\n117. Considering the above, the Tribunal considered it more likely than not\nthat the regular cleaning undertaken at the Building would have\nincorporated any items of additional cleaning which arose as a result of\nthe disrepair, because those areas of the Building would have been\ncleaned anyway. For example, the carpets would have been steam\ncleaned quarterly anyway. Therefore, the Tribunal did not think that the\ncleaning costs were likely to have been exacerbated because of the\ndisrepair.\n118. Whilst the Applicants had raised a general issue as to the standard of\nthe work, they had not provided evidence to demonstrate that the\nstandard of the service had fallen short of reasonable. Furthermore, the\nApplicants acknowledged that general cleaning work had been\nundertaken. The Tribunal acknowledged that the Respondent had\nidentified an issue with the standard of the service provided by the\ncompany which undertook the cleaning for a short period in 2021, but\nthere was no evidence of any incidents in that period.\n119. Considering the above, the Tribunal determined, on the\nevidence before it, that the standard of the cleaning was\nreasonable and that the disrepair did not exacerbate the\ncharges, such that no reduction is made to the cleaning\ncharges which are reasonable and payable.\nOutstanding invoices in dispute in the Updated Schedule\nCleaning faeces and photocell replacement (door entry system)\n29\n\n120. These charges of £234 plus VAT and £495 plus VAT related to the same\nincident; the Applicant’s alleged that inadequate security led to the need\nfor the waste to be removed before the work could be undertaken. The\ndoor entry system was then repaired another day. The Applicants had\nconcerned that they had paid for a duplicate visit. The Respondent\nprovided two separate invoices (one for the cleaning and one for the\nrepair) and explained that parts had to be ordered before the repair could\nbe done, and there was no separate second call out charge. Based upon\nthe Respondent’s evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied that there\nwas no duplicated cost and that these charges were reasonably\nincurred and payable.\nDMC Scaffolding Services Ltd\n121. There were several instances where the Respondent had incurred costs\ncarrying out repair work shortly after the completion of the Major Works\nand the Applicant had concerns that this was due to the Major Works\nbeing defective, and that these were effectively duplicated costs. The\nApplicants are unclear why further repair work would be required less\nthan 12 months after completion of the Major Works. The Respondents\nsay that the work was required to repair new leaks in the roof / issues\nwhich occurred after the Major Works; that it is an Old Building and the\nMajor Works were not a complete set of works such that it will be the\ncase that new leaks arise. In closing submissions, Ms Ackerley said that\nit is possible that the leaks stemmed from the Major Works, and that the\ninvoices for the work did not clarify the exact location nor exactly what\nthe works were.\n122. The Respondent has provided evidence that the works were\nundertaken, and the charges were incurred by way of the invoices. The\nTribunal did not consider that the Respondent needed to show the exact\nlocation of the leaks / works nor provide further details of what the works\nentailed. The Respondent’s explanation that the work related to new\nleaks which had appeared after the Major Works, and that the Major\nWorks were not a complete set of work such that new leaks would arise,\nseemed perfectly plausible to the Tribunal. The Tribunal accepted\nthe Respondent’s evidence and, therefore, found that the\ncharges were reasonably incurred and payable.\n123. There were some other scaffolding charges in respect of which the\nRespondent confirmed they had not been charged to the leaseholders\nsuch that they were no longer live issues.\nRepair works to window\n124. The Applicant challenged an invoice in the sum of £1,250 plus VAT\ndated 15/09/2021 in respect of repair work to windows. The Applicants\nsaid that several windows were repaired during the Major Works, and\nthey did not know which window this related to. Furthermore, they said\nthey had observed repairs being undertaken to resolve the issue of\nwindows having been painted over during the Major Works. The\n30\n\nRespondent said this was a new leak around a window (after the Major\nWorks).\n125. Similarly to the case in respect of new leaks to the roof, the Tribunal\naccepts the Respondent’s evidence that the Major Works were not a\ncomplete scheme of works and that new leaks will arise. Therefore, the\nTribunal considers it to be perfectly plausible and accepts that this was a\nnew leak which needed to be addressed. Therefore, the Tribunal\nfinds that this charge was reasonably incurred and payable.\nOther items\n126. Ms Ackerley confirmed in closing submissions that none of the other\nitems in the Updated Schedule were still in dispute, the Respondent\nhaving provided copies of invoices and explanations.\nAPPLICATIONS UNDER SECTION 20C OF THE 1985 ACT AND\nPARAGRAPH 5A OF SCHEDULE 11 OF THE 2002 ACT\n127. The Applicants arguments were like those in respect of the\nmanagement fees; that the Building had been managed badly and that\ncommunication / transparency had been poor on the part of the\nRespondent and it was necessary for the Applicants to bring these\nproceedings to obtain information which the Respondent had not\nprovided previously despite repeated requests. In addition, they queried\nwhether the Lease permitted the Respondent to recover legal costs as\npart of the service charge. Ms Ackerley also pointed out that the\nRespondent had made concessions in the Updated Schedule of disputed\ninvoices.\n128. Mr Dovar directed the Tribunal to clause 7 (5) (c) of the Lease which\nstated that the Service Provision shall include:\n“all reasonable fees charges and expenses payable to the Surveyor any\nsolicitor accountant surveyor valuer architect or other person who the\nLandlord may from time to time reasonably employ in connection with\nthe management or maintenance of the Building…”\n129. Mr Dovar said that the Applicants’ approach had been unacceptable;\nthey had run arguments in respect of which they had then made\nsignificant concessions during the hearing in relation to the s 20ZA\ndispensation and the demands. He said that the major dispute relating\nto the Major Works, which had led to it being listed for a three-day\nhearing, had not been warranted. Furthermore, the Applicants accepted\n£90,ooo of the Major Works from the start, but some Applicants had\nwithheld all the service charges.\n130. The Tribunal found that clause 7 (5) (c) did permit the\nRespondent to potentially recover its legal costs. Whilst there\nwas no express reference to legal costs, it referred to the “reasonable\n31\n\nfees” of “any solicitor” which the Tribunal considered to be the same\nthing.\n131. Generally, it will be just and equitable to make an order depriving the\nRespondent of the ability to recover their costs of proceedings as part of\nthe service charge in the normal way if leaseholders have been successful\nin their challenge to the service charge. In the present case, the\nApplicants have been successful, but only to a small extent. In the main,\nthe Tribunal has found in favour of the Respondent. That said, in\naddition to the reductions made by the Tribunal, it is noted that the\nRespondent also made several, late, significant concessions in the\nUpdated Schedule.\n132. It is the case that the Applicants decided not to pursue a few significant\npoints at the hearing. However, the Tribunal considers that the\nApplicants cannot be criticised too much for that, since they no doubt\nrelied upon the legal advice they received initially, and there was a period\nbefore the hearing when they were without legal assistance and without\nthe benefit of Ms Ackerley’s input. The decision to concede those points\nat the hearing was a sensible, albeit late, one.\n133. Whilst acknowledging that the length of the hearing was not\nproportionate to the outcome for the Applicants in terms of the\ndeductions made, the Tribunal had some sympathy for the Applicants in\nthat the Building had been mismanaged by the Respondents over the\nyears and that had clearly caused significant distress to the Applicants.\nFurthermore, the Respondent’s failures in terms of communication and\ntransparency meant that the Applicants felt they had to pursue the\nproceedings to obtain clarity. That had not, however, justified the\nposition of some of the Applicants in withholding all the service charges,\nand the Tribunal also acknowledged that the Respondent had acted\nreasonably in paying for some of the repair work itself.\n134. Having balanced all the above, the Tribunal determined that\nit was just and equitable to make limited orders under section\n20C of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and paragraph 5A of\nSchedule 11 to the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act\n2002, restricting the Respondent to recovering 90% of its legal\ncosts (and extinguishing 10% of the Applicants’ liability).\nSigned: J L Hadley\nJudge of the First-tier Tribunal\nDate: 16 December 2025\n32\n\nANNEX\nList of Applicant Leaseholders\nFlat 1 Michelle Neighbour\nFlat 2 Henry Semanda\nFlat 3 Denise Senior\nFlat 6 Mohammed Zubair\nFlat 7 Alicia Leontieff and Wendy Davis\nFlat 8 Tuesday Holder\nFlat 9 Peter Dyer\nFlat 11 Kevin Marshall\nFlat 14 Adam Clough and Andy Entwistle\nFlat 15 Nina Brocklehurst and Levi Brocklehurst\nFlat 16 David Williams\nFlat 18 Samantha Owens\nFlat 19 Mark Williams\nFlat 20 Andrew Charlton and Gemma Wardle\nFlat 21 Marco Li\nFlat 22 Chris Bridgeman\nFlat 23 Huma Ali\nFlat 26 Tom Cotton\nFlat 30 Matt Hatton\nFlat 31 Heather Rylance\nFlat 32 Dylan Longworth\nFlat 33 John McCarthy\nFlat 36 Michael Del Rosso\n33"

Richard James\n2. Hilary James\nType of : Housing and Planning Act 2016 –\nApplication Section 41(1)\nTribunalMembers : Judge L. F. McLean\nMr J. FaulknerFRICS\nDate of Hearing : 17th December2025\nDate ofDecision : 23rdJanuary2026\nDECISION\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2026\n1\n\nDECISIONSOF THETRIBUNAL\n(1) The Tribunal is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that\nthe Respondentscommitted an offence under section 95(1)\nof the Housing Act 2004 without reasonable excuse.\n(2) The Tribunal makes a Rent Repayment Order against the\nSecond Respondent in the sum of £6,477.20 to be paid to\nthe Applicant within 28 days of the date of this Decision.\n(3) The Tribunal further orders that the Second Respondent\nshall pay the Applicant an additional £337, as\nreimbursement of the application and hearing fees,within\n28 days of the date of this Decision.\nREASONS\nTheApplication\n1. On 14th November 2024, the Applicant applied to the Tribunal for a\nRent Repayment Order (i.e. an order under Section 41(1) of the\nHousing and Planning Act 2016 requiring the landlord under a\ntenancy of housing in England to repay an amount of rent paid by a\ntenant) (“RRO”) against the Respondents in respect of rent paid by\nthe Applicant under a tenancy of 30 Douglas Road, Liverpool, L4\n2RQ (“the Property”).\nBackground\n2. The Second Respondent is (or was at the material times) the\nregistered proprietor of the Property at HM Land Registry (and thus\nthelandlordthereof).\n3. The First Respondent is reportedly the husband of the Second\nRespondent. The evidence of the Applicantshowsthat he effectively\nmanaged the Property and received the rent for it.\n4. The Applicant was the tenant of the Property from around 20th\nDecember 2022 until 5thDecember 2023.\n5. The Applicant initially signed a temporary accommodation\nagreement for the Property offered on 12th December 2022 and\ncounter-signedon around 14thDecember 2022,pending the eviction\nof the existing tenants of other premises – which, presumably, the\nApplicant had originally intended to rent. The initial rent was stated\nto be £600 for the period from 20th December 2022 to 20thJanuary\n2023(which was paid on 12thDecember 2022), and £750 per month\nthereafter (expressed, somewhat inaccurately, as “£187.50 per\nweek”). The agreement was signed by the First Respondent. The\n2\n\nlandlord was not clearly named or identified, but the document was\nbranded under the name of “James Development Group”.\n6. The Applicant paid a total of £8,096.50 in rent payments for the\nProperty between12thDecember 2022 and 20thNovember 2023.\n7. On17thSeptember 2025, the Tribunal gave directions for each party\nto prepare an electronic bundle of relevant documents, including\nwritten submissions and copies of evidence upon which each party\nrelied. The Applicant submittedherbundle, consisting of some108\npages and to which the Tribunal has had regard. The Respondents\ndid not produce any bundlein readiness for the hearing.\nGrounds of the Application\n8. The Applicant’s grounds for seeking a RRO were set out in her\napplication notice dated 14th November 2024 and expanded\nstatement of reasonsdated7thOctober 2025, and theseincludedthe\nfollowing criminal offence whichshe allegedhad been committed by\nthe Respondents:-\ni. Housing Act 2004 Section95(1)–Offence ofhaving control of or\nmanaging a house which is required to be licensed under Part3 of\nthe Housing Act 2004 (see section 85(1)) but is not so licensed –\ncommittedbetween12thDecember 2022and5thDecember 2023.\nIssues\n9. The issues which the Tribunal had to decide were:-\ni. Is the Tribunal satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the\nRespondentshave committed one or more of the offences set out\natSection40(3) of the Housing and Planning Act 2016?\nii. Did the offence(s) relate to housing that, at the time of the offence,\nwas let to the Applicant?\niii. Was an offence committed in the period of 12 months ending with\nthe date the application was made?\niv. In all the circumstances, should the Tribunal make a RRO against\nthe Respondents?\nv. What is the maximum amount that can be ordered under section\n44(3) of the Act?\n(a)What is the applicable 12-month period?\n(b)Ascertain the whole of the rent for the relevant period\n(c) Subtract any element of that sum that represents\npayment for utilities that only benefited the tenant, for\nexample gas, electricity and internet access\nvi. What proportion of the rent (after deduction as above) is a fair\nreflection of the seriousness of this offence?\nvii. Consider whether any deduction from, or addition to, that figure\nshould be made in the light of the other factors set out in Section\n44(4) of the Housing Act 2004, based on:-\n(a)The conduct of theRespondents?\n3\n\n(b)The financial circumstances of theRespondents?\n(c) Whether the Respondents have at any time been\nconvicted of any relevant offences?\n(d)The conduct of theApplicant?\n(e) Any other factors?\nRelevant Law\n10. The relevant sections of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 read as\nfollows:-\n40 Introduction and key definitions\n(1) This Chapter confers power on the First-tier Tribunal to make a\nrent repayment order where a landlord has committed an offence to\nwhich this Chapter applies.\n(2) A rent repayment order is an order requiring the landlord under\na tenancy of housing in England to—\n(a) repay an amount of rent paid by a tenant, or\n(b) pay a local housing authority an amount in respect of a\nrelevant award of universal credit paid (to any person) in respect\nof rent under the tenancy.\n(3) A reference to “an offence to which this Chapter applies” is to an\noffence, of a description specified in the table, that is committed by\na landlord in relation to housing in England let by that landlord.\nAct section general description of offence\n1 Criminal Law Act Section 6(1) violence for securing entry\n1977\n2 Protection from Section 1(2), unlawful eviction or\nEviction Act 1977 (3) or (3A) harassment of occupiers\n3 Housing Act 2004 Section 30(1) failure to comply with\nimprovement notice\n4 Section 32(1) failure to comply with\nprohibition order etc.\n5 Section 72(1) control or management of\nunlicensed HMO\n6 Section 95(1) control or management of\nunlicensed house\n7 Housing and Section 21 breach of banning order\nPlanning Act 2016\n41 Application for rent repayment order\n4\n\n(1) A tenant or a local housing authority may apply to the First-tier\nTribunal for a rent repayment order against a person who has\ncommitted an offence to which this Chapter applies.\n(2) A tenant may apply for a rent repayment order only if—\n(a) the offence relates to housing that, at the time of the offence,\nwas let to the tenant, and\n(b) the offence was committed in the period of 12 months ending\nwith the day on which the application is made.\n43 Making of rent repayment order\n(1) The First-tier Tribunal may make a rent repayment order if\nsatisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that a landlord has committed\nan offence to which this Chapter applies (whether or not the landlord\nhas been convicted).\n(2) A rent repayment order under this section may be made only on\nan application under section 41.\n(3) The amount of a rent repayment order under this section is to be\ndetermined in accordance with—\n(a) section 44 (where the application is made by a tenant);\n(b) section 45 (where the application is made by a local housing\nauthority);\n(c) section 46 (in certain cases where the landlord has been\nconvicted etc).\n44 Amount of order: tenants\n(1) Where the First-tier Tribunal decides to make a rent repayment\norder under section 43 in favour of a tenant, the amount is to be\ndetermined in accordance with this section.\n(2) The amount must relate to rent paid during the period mentioned\nin the table.\nIf the order is made on the the amount must relate to\nground that the landlord rent paid by the tenant in\nhas committed respect of\nan offence mentioned in row 1 or the period of 12 months ending\n2 of the table in section 40(3) with the date of the offence\nan offence mentioned in row 3, a period, not exceeding 12\n4, 5, 6 or 7 of the table in section months, during which the\n40(3) landlord was committing the\noffence\n(3) The amount that the landlord may be required to repay in respect\nof a period must not exceed—\n(a) the rent paid in respect of that period, less\n(b) any relevant award of universal credit paid (to any person) in\nrespect of rent under the tenancy during that period.\n(4) In determining the amount the tribunal must, in particular, take\ninto account—\n(a) the conduct of the landlord and the tenant,\n5\n\n(b) the financial circumstances of the landlord, and\n(c) whether the landlord has at any time been convicted of an\noffence to which this Chapter applies.\n11. Section 95 of the Housing Act 2004, so far as is relevant, reads as\nfollows:-\n95 Offences in relation to licensing of houses under this\nPart\n(1)A person commits an offence if he is a person having control of or\nmanaging a house which is required to be licensed under this Part\n(see section 85(1)) but is not so licensed.\n[…]\nIn proceedings against a person for an offence under subsection (1)\nor (2) it is a defence that he had a reasonable excuse—\n(a) for having control of or managing the house in the\ncircumstances mentioned in subsection (1), or\n(b) for failing to comply with the condition,\nas the case may be.\nThe Hearing –Procedure, Evidence andSubmissions\nAbsence of the Respondents\n12. The hearing took place remotely via the HMCTS CVP serviceon 17th\nDecember 2025with a scheduledstart time of10.00am.\n13. The Applicant was represented by James Cairns of Justice for\nTenants. Also in attendance were the Applicant and her son Josh\nCoulson.\n14. There was no appearance by or representation on behalf of the\nRespondents and there was no application to adjourn the hearing.\nThe Tribunal invited representations from the Applicant on whether\nthe hearing should proceed in the absence of the Respondents,\npursuant to Rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)\n(Property Chamber) Rules 2013. The Applicant’s representative\nreferred to evidence of the attempts which had been made to bring\nthe proceedings and the hearing details to the Respondents’\nattention. This included:-\ni. Sending a copy of the application and full final hearing bundle\n(including the hearing date)by postto\n(a)the Property;\n(b)the SecondRespondent’s registered address at HM Land\nRegistry; and\n6\n\n(c) 99 Stanley Road, Liverpool L20 7DA (being the trading\naddress for James Development Group);\nii. Notice of hearing sent by email to\nrjames@jamesdevelopmentgroup.co.uk;\niii. Notice of hearing sent by email topropertypeople@outlook.com;\niv. Notice of hearing sent by WhatsApp message to the First\nRespondent’s mobile phone number.\n15. The Tribunal members were able to confirm, having checked thecase\nfile, that notice of the hearing had recently been posted again by the\nTribunal Office to Richard James and to Hilary James (under\nseparate cover)to both theSecond Respondent’saddress in Denbigh\nand to the address at 99 Stanley Road. The Respondents had been\nasked whether they had an email address to which details of the\nvideo hearing couldbe sent, but there had been no reply.\n16. The Tribunal members weresatisfied thattheRespondentshadbeen\ngiven adequate notice of the hearing. It wasin the interests of justice\nto proceed, as the Respondents had shown no interest in attending\nthe hearing and it would be a fruitless exercise to delay the hearing\nfurther.\nWitness Evidence\n17. The Applicant was invited to confirm the contents of her witness\nstatement. She had nothing further to add by way of oral evidence.\nThe Tribunal accepted her statement as her evidence in chief and\nhad no further questions for her.\n18. Josh Coulson was invited to confirm the contents of his witness\nstatement. He had nothing further to add by way of oral evidence.\nThe Tribunal accepted his statement as his evidence in chief and had\nno further questions for him.\nProposedOrder\n19. The Tribunal had already had regard to the Applicant’s written\nsubmissions regarding the basis on which aRROwas sought.\n20. The Tribunalconcluded the hearing and retired to deliberate.\nThe Tribunal’sDecision\nIs the Tribunal satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the Respondents have\ncommitted one or more of the offences set out at Section 40(3) of the Housing\nand Planning Act 2016?\n21. The uncontested evidence of the Applicant is that:-\ni. the Property required a licence under the selective licensing\nscheme operated by Liverpool City Council from 1st April 2022\nuntil 31stMarch 2027;\n7\n\nii. no such licence was in place at any point after 31st March 2020\nand was still not in place as atthe end of the tenancy;\niii. the First Respondent was the person who received the rack-rent\nof the Property(whether on his own account or as agent or trustee\nof another person) and was thus the “person having control” of\nthe Property (Section 263(1) Housing Act 2004);\niv. the Second Respondent was the legal owner of the Property who\nreceived (whether directly or through an agent or trustee) rents\nor other payments from the Applicant in occupation as tenant of\nthe whole of the Property (or would so have received those rents\nbut for having entered into an arrangement – whether in\npursuance of a court order or otherwise – with another person\nwho is not an owner or lessee of the premises by virtue of which\nthat other person receives the rents or other payments), and thus\nthe “person managing” the Property (Section 263(1) Housing Act\n2004).\n22. There was no evidence to suggest that any licence had been applied\nfor. Neither was there any evidence to suggest the existence of any\n“reasonable excuse” for failing to have a licence or to apply for one.\n23. Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, and\nfinds as fact, that each of the Respondents had committed the\noffence under Section 95(1) for the entire duration of the relevant\nperiods before and during the tenancy from 12th December 2022 to\n5thDecember 2023.\nDid the offence(s) relate to housing that, at the time of the offence, was let to\nthe Applicant?\n24. Yes. The Applicant was the tenant of the Property for the material\ntime during which the offence was committed.\nWas an offence committed in the period of 12 months ending with the date the\napplication was made?\n25. Yes. The offence was committed continuously until at least 5th\nDecember 2023, and the application was made on 14th November\n2024.\nIn all the circumstances, should the Tribunal make a RRO against the\nRespondents?\n26. Under Section 40(2) of the Housing and Planning Act 2016, a RRO\nmay be made by the Tribunal against “the” landlord under a tenancy.\nTheSupreme Courthas confirmed thatthe appropriate party against\nwhom the RRO should be made is the immediate landlord of the\napplicant tenant(Rakusen v Jepsen[2023] UKSC 9). The “landlord”\nin this context usually means the person who was entitled to grant\nthe tenancy which led to the rent being generated, i.e. aperson with\na legal estate in possession, although there are circumstances when\n8\n\na landlord and tenant relationship can be inferred between a person\nwho did not actually hold a legal estate if they have purported to\ngrant exclusive possession to another (see Bruton v London and\nQuadrant Housing Trust [1999] UKHL 26). This position will be\nchanged when the reforms under the Renters’ Rights Act 2025 are\nbrought into force, but this is still awaited as at the date of this\ndecision.\n27. The Tribunal noted that the tenancy agreement for the Property was\nsigned by the First Respondent, rent was frequently paid to the First\nRespondent (and not at all to the Second Respondent), and that the\nApplicant and her son referred to the First Respondent as “the\nlandlord”. However, the Tribunal is aware that tenants will\nhabitually and colloquially refer to their main point of contact as\nbeing “the landlord”, even if that person is merely an agent or\ndirector acting on the true landlord’s behalf. There was noevidence,\nother than possibly circumstantial evidence, that the Second\nRespondent had leased the Property to the First Respondentand/or\nthat the First Respondent was entitled to sub-let the Property. There\nis no registered leasehold interest noted against the freehold title for\nthe Property. The Tribunal was not invited to infer the existence of\na “rent-to-rent” relationship between the Respondents, and it does\nnot do so in any event.\n28. The Tribunal accordingly finds, on the evidence available, that the\n“landlord” of the Property was the Second Respondent and that the\nFirst Respondent acted as her agent. As such, the Tribunal is only\nable to make a RRO against the Second Respondent.\n29. The Tribunal also found that it was just and appropriate to make a\nRRO against the Second Respondent.\nWhat is the maximum amount that can be ordered under section 44(3) of the\nAct?\nWhat is the applicable 12-month period?\n30. For the purposes of Section 44(2) of the Housing and Planning Act\n2016, the maximum period which can be taken into account is 12th\nDecember 2022until and including 5thDecember 2023.\nAscertain the whole of the rent for the relevant period\n31. As noted earlier, the whole of the rent actually paid by the Applicant\ncame to £8,096.50. This was less than the original contracted rent,\ndue to various discounts offered by the First Respondent for\ninconvenience to the Applicant and also due to the final instalment\nbeing reduced pro-rata.\nSubtract any element of that sum that represents payment for utilities that\nonly benefited the tenant, for example gas, electricity and internet access\n9\n\n32. It is for the landlord to supply evidence of these, but if precise figures\nare not available an experienced tribunal will be able to make an\ninformed estimate.\n33. The Applicant’s evidence was that she was liable for utility costs in\nrespect of the Property, as provided for in the tenancy agreement.\nThe Applicant’s bank statements indicated that she paid for water\nand gas/electricity utilities.\n34. There was no evidence to suggest that any utilities or otherservices,\nentitlementsor benefitswere included in the rent payments.\n35. No deduction is to be madeunder this heading.\nWhat proportion of the rent (after deduction as above) is a fair reflection of the\nseriousness of this offence?\n36. The Tribunal should consider how serious this offence was, both\ncompared to other types of offence in respect of which aRROmay be\nmade (and whose relative seriousness can be seen from the relevant\nmaximum sentences on conviction) and compared to other examples\nof the same type of offence.\n37. A percentage proportion, according to seriousness, is the starting\npoint (in the sense that that term is used in criminal sentencing); it\nis the default penalty in the absence of any other factors but it may\nbe higher or lower in light of the final step.\n38. The Applicant had contended for a “starting point” of 80%, in line\nwith more serious cases summarised in Newell v Abbott [2024]\nUKUT 181 (LC), such as Aytan v Moore [2022] UKUT 27 (LC),\nChoudhury v Razak [2022] UKUT 239 (LC), and Irvine v Metcalfe\n[2023] UKUT 283 (LC). This was on the grounds of the Respondents\nbeing professional landlords, the Respondents having evidently\nknown (or ought to have known) that the Property required a licence\nunder a selective licensing scheme as it had done in the past, the\nsignificant length of the failure to licence, the fire safety risks present\nin the Property, the damp and mould present in the Property, and\nthe Respondents’ failure to return her deposit at the end of the\ntenancy.\n39. The Tribunal broadly agreed with the Applicant’s position, although\non balance considered that a “starting point” of 75% was a fairer\nfigure since the fire safety risks were of a less serious nature (being\nthe absence of certain safety precautions rather thanthe presence of\nan inherent risk of combustion or explosion).\nConsider whether any deduction from, or addition to, that figure should be\nmade in the light of the other factors set out inSection 44(4)of the Housing Act\n2004\n10\n\nThe conduct of the Respondents\n40. The Tribunal agreed that the Respondents’ conduct was poor. The\nApplicants were denied the use of a dining room at the Property as\nthe Respondents were storing personal belongings in it. The\nProperty was undersized for the Applicant’s household and she was\nforced to use the living room as a bedroom. The First Respondent\nbroke promises to move the Applicant and her family into a larger\nhome. There were repeated failures by the Respondents to deal with\ntheir repairing obligations. These issues meant that the Applicant\nhad to seek assistance from Shelter.\nThe financial circumstances of the Respondents\n41. No direct evidence was available regarding the Respondents’\nfinancial circumstances. It is evident that the First Respondent’s\nproperty management company, James Development Group\nLimited, has been put into liquidation. However, the reasons for this\nare not entirely clear, and it would be speculative to draw any\nconclusions as to what financial impact that may have had upon the\nRespondents themselves.\nWhether the Respondents have at any time been convicted of any relevant\noffences\n42. There was no evidence that either of the Respondents had been\nconvicted of any relevant offences.\nThe conduct of the Applicant\n43. The Applicant’s unchallenged evidence was that she conducted\nherself in a good and tenantlike manner.\nAny other factors\n44. There were no other substantial factors to bear in mind.\nNet adjustment\n45. The Applicant had contended that, overall, the aggravating factors\nset out above merited an “uplift” of 5% in the percentage of rent to\nbe repaid under the RRO. The Tribunal agreed with this view.\nTotal amount of RRO payable\n46. The total amount to be paid by the Second Respondent under the\nRRO is as follows:-\n£8,096.50×(0.75 + 0.05) =£6,477.20\n11\n\nCosts of the proceedings\n47. The Applicant sought payment of the cost of the application fee and\nthe hearing fee. The Tribunal is empowered to award such costs\nunder Rule 13(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)\n(Property Chamber) Rules 2013. The Applicant has succeeded in her\ncase, and so it is just and equitable to order that her costs be paid.\nThe Tribunal makes this award of costs against the Second\nRespondent only, being the person against whom the RRO is made.\nName: Date:23rdJanuary2026\nJudge L. F. McLean\nMr J. Faulkner FRICS\nRights of appeal\n1. By Rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the Tribunal is required to notify the parties about\nany right of appeal they may have.\n2. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to\nthe First-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with\nthe case.\n3. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional\noffice within 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the\ndecision to the person making the application.\n4. If the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\nfor permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the time\nlimit.\n5. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the\ncase number), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\n6. If the Tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further\napplication for permission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber).\n12"

On 4 January 2024, the Tribunal made a remediation order (‘the Order’)\nunder section 123 of the Building Safety Act 2022 (the “BSA”). The Order\nrequired the Respondent to remedy certain specified defects at Centrillion\nPoint, 2 Masons Avenue, Croydon CRO 9WX, by 31 May 2025. As is\napparent from the Order, those defects are extensive, and include\nunprotected structural steelwork and floor supports (at risk of collapse in\na fire), breaches/inadequate protection of the smoke stack walls, and\nsubstantial compartmentation issues in both common parts and\nthroughout The Order provided that remediation of the relevant defects\nwas to be completed by 31 May 2025. The Tribunal had already indicated\nits decision orally at the hearing on 1 December 2023 and informed the\nparties that the period for remediation would commence from that date,\nin Order for the Respondent to progress works as soon as possible.\n2. On 28 April 2025, Ms Mistry, the lead Applicant, wrote to the Tribunal\n(copying the Respondent’s solicitors) noting that although the specified\nperiod had nearly expired, no works had been carried out. The Tribunal\nsubsequently wrote to the Respondent seeking its comments on the\nassertion that it had failed to comply with the Order.\n3. By application dated 15 May 2025, the Respondent sought to vary the\nOrder to give it more time to comply. The application was supported by a\nsecond witness statement from Natalie Chambers, director of the\nRespondent, dated 14 May 2025, setting out the Respondent’s actions over\nthe past 18-months.\n4. The Tribunal listed the matter for hearing, which ultimately took place on\n24 June 2025. In advance of that hearing, Ms Mistry provided a statement\nin response.\n2\n\n5. At the hearing, Ms Mistry represented the Applicants. Mr Sawtell of\ncounsel appeared on behalf of the Respondent.\nDiscussion\n6. Mr Sawtell began by stressing that the Respondent is both disappointed\nand frustrated to have to make the application. Broadly, the Respondent’s\nposition was that the delay was principally the fault of Durkan, the\ndeveloper, whom it has contracted with to do the works. The Respondent\nasserted that it was a reasonable course of action to engage Durkan to do\nthe works, although with hindsight it would have acted differently.\n7. It was accepted that no works have been carried out (save for installation\nof a temporary fire alarm system), and indeed no scope of works has yet\nbeen agreed to enable them to commence. The Respondent and Durkan\ncontinue to be in negotiations about what is required, in particular in\nrespect of two fundamental matters to remediation of the building; the\nworks required and to be delivered both to the smoke stack and partition\nwalls.\n8. The Respondents seeks an extension to the Tribunal’s Order, suggesting\nthat a period of 68 weeks be allowed to complete the works. However, the\napplication asserts that 68 weeks can commence only when the\nappropriate application to the Building Safety Regulator has been made,\nin connection with any agreed scope of works. It is accepted that no\napplication has been made to the Building Safety Regulator, with the\nresult that the Respondent is not in a position to say when the 68-week\nperiod could start. It therefore seeks by its application an extension to an\nindefinite date.\n9. On any view, the period of extension sought is likely to be longer than the\noriginal 18-month period contained in the Tribunal’s Remediation Order.\nThe proposed 68 weeks is for the construction phase only. On her evidence\nin her first witness statement, Ms Chambers’ evidence was that the\nconstruction phase would take 7 – 9 months (paragraph 35), and the\npreconstruction phase a year at most (paragraphs 36-37). .\n3\n\n10. Ms Chambers, in her second witness statement, sets out in detail the\nhistory of the past 18 months, and maintains that the Respondent has\nbeen proactive throughout in negotiating with Durkan and that the delays\nare not of its making. Mr Sawtell pointed to three stages of delay that have\noccurred:\n(1) The period to July 2024 comprising the negotiations with\nDurkan leading to the signing of a remediation works\nagreement;\n(2) The fire alarm installation, which was completed in January\n2025; and\n(3) Investigation into the defects to enable development of the\ndesign for the works from January 2025 to date.\n11. It was also suggested that once the remediation agreement with Durkan\nhad been entered into, the Respondent lost a certain amount of control\nwith regard to the progress that could be made – in effect, it was in\nDurkan’s hands. We do not accept that this takes the Respondent’s\nargument much further. It was the Respondent that negotiated the\nagreement with Durkan and thereby agreed the provisions regarding\ncontrol of the project, timescales and deadlines, and that might allow it to\nterminate the agreement should sufficient progress not be made. The\nRespondent is not, as Mr Sawtell submitted, in an analogous position to a\nlandlord whose developer has entered into the Government’s Self-\nRemediation Terms, in which the landlord has no control over the terms\nagreed (and indeed is not party to the agreement).\n12. Based on the Respondent’s own evidence in the original hearing, it was\nacknowledged that the Respondent has been in contact with Durkan for at\nleast two years. According to Ms Chambers’ first statement at paragraph\n25, on 31 July 2023, the Respondent’s then solicitors wrote to Durkan\nsetting out its responsibilities and obligations as a developer under the\nBSA and invited its representatives to attend a site inspection. On 11\nAugust 2023, it received a reply from the Durkan’s then solicitors\nconfirming that Durkan would attend. As noted at the hearing, Durkan\nhad also remediated unsafe cladding at the building in or around 2021. As\n4\n\nsuch, it is all the more difficult to justify that works have not even started\nalmost two years later and despite the Order.\n13. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal fully accepts that the Respondent\nhas been in active discussions with Durkan throughout. That is clear from\nMs Chambers’ evidence. However, that cannot detract from several key\npoints which are not in dispute:\n(1) The remediation Order was made solely against the\nRespondent. It was not made against Durkan, and Durkan was\nnot a party to those proceedings. The Respondent is the only\nparty that can carry out works as it is the freeholder of the\nbuilding. Aside from the Order, it also has responsibilities\nunder repairing covenants in its leases.\n(2) The Order is not concerned with who bears the cost of such\nworks – it simply orders them to be carried out by the\nRespondent;\n(3) No works have been commenced, let alone completed.\n(4) No scope of works has been agreed.\n(5) No application has been submitted to the Building Safety\nRegulator in respect of such works.\n14. Further, it is clear from Ms Chambers’ evidence that as long ago as July\n2024, the Respondent was aware that the works could not be completed\non time. Nevertheless, the Respondent chose, on advice, not to inform that\nTribunal at this stage. While Ms Chambers’ statement maintains that\nattempts were made to keep leaseholders informed of progress in relation\nnegotiations and proposals, it appears that they were not advised of this\nfact. It is said that the decision not to apply for a variation to the Order in\nJuly 2024 was due to the fact that it would be “sensible to delay making\nthe application until some substantive progress had been made and the\napplication to the Building Safety Regulator had been submitted so that\nwe had a clearer idea of timescales when approaching the Tribunal”.\n15. Firstly, it remains the case that no application to the Building Safety\nRegulator has been submitted.\n5\n\n16. Secondly, in seeking variation of the Order now, it is suggested that it is\n“…difficult to give a set timescale for the works to be completed at this\ntime, because they cannot be commenced until after the BSR application\nhas been approved”. No timeframe is provided for agreement of the scope\nof works. No timeframe is provided for the subsequent preparation of the\nGateway 2 application to the Building Safety Regulator, which application\nwill require careful preparation so as to receive approval as quickly as\npossible. It is not disputed that to date, over 18 months since the Order\nwas made, no Gateway 2 application has been made (according to the\nRespondent‘s skeleton argument, such application “is anticipated\nimminently”).\n17. Both of those facts are set in the context that the period set by the Order\nhas now expired.\n18. As noted above, the purpose of a remediation order is to remedy specified\nrelevant defects. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction under section 123 of the BSA\nis not concerned with who pays for those works. While the advantages to\nthe Respondent to Durkan undertaking the work can be understood from\nits own financial perspective, it was always the Respondent’s obligation to\nensure that the specified relevant defects were remedied in accordance\nwith the time stipulated in the Order. The Respondent could at any time\nhave sought a remediation contribution order from the developer but has\nnever done so. As such, the lack of cooperation from the developer can\nonly be of limited relevance to the application before us.\n19. As to the role of the Building Safety Regulator and the delays said to be\noccurring in processing applications, we accept that the period for the\ngrant of approval for works is, to a certain extent, outside of the\nRespondent’s control. However, the question is likely to be one of a matter\nof a few weeks here or there.\n20. Ultimately, this also demonstrates the fundamental difficulty with the\npresent application. The Respondent seeks an additional 68 weeks to\ncarry out the works. However, since no application to the Building Safety\nRegulator has been made, the Respondent is unable to say when such\nperiod of 68 weeks should start. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal to make\n6\n\na remediation under section 123 of the BSA includes provision that the\nspecified works be done within a ‘specified time’. However, paragraph 32\nof the Respondent’s evidence simply asks that the time for compliance be\nextended pending approval of the Respondent’s “imminent” application\nto the Building Safety Regulator and that the Respondent “should notify\nthe Tribunal and the applicants once approval has been received and\nprovide further details of the likely timescales for the remediation works\nto be completed with a view to a revised deadline being set”. This would\nin effect create an open-ended period which the Tribunal would not be\nprepared to make, and which (more importantly) would not appear to be\nwithin our power to make.\n21. Further, even leaving aside the jurisdictional problem, the Respondent is\neffectively asking the Tribunal more than double the original time\nspecified in the Order to remedy the specified relevant defects. In\ncircumstances where the works have not been commenced and the\nRespondent cannot even say when they would start, this is difficult to\njustify. We sought submissions from Mr Sawtell inviting him to persuade\nus it would be reasonable to make such an order, but in the round he was\nin an invidious position given the matters set out above.\n22. The Respondent’s application has been met with dismay by the\nApplicants, who continue to live in an un-remediated building. Ms Mistry\nstated that she was “disappointed but not surprised” by the delay. She also\ncommented that in a full remediation schedule issued by Thomasons on\n25 March 2025 (i.e. almost 15 months after the Order), aside from the\nidentification of wooden panels in the reception area, the matters were\nessentially the same as identified in the Order. As such she submitted that\nin the circumstances, the application remained opposed: she could not\njustify to other leaseholders agreeing to an extension of more than the\nperiod of the original Order, and instead wished to proceed to enforce in\nthe County Court. We alerted Ms Mistry to the potential cost and delay of\ntaking such a course, which may or may not result in an\ninjunction/damages and would likely in any event result in the\nRespondent being given more time to comply because, ultimately, the\n7\n\nbuilding stills requires remediation. She was satisfied that was the only\nreasonable option open to the leaseholders at this stage on the basis of the\ncompound failures of the Respondent.\nAdjournment request\n23. In Mr Sawtell’s skeleton argument and again during the course of the\nhearing, it was suggested that the hearing be adjourned. In the skeleton\nargument it was suggested that there be a 2-day hearing at which oral\nevidence could be heard so as to resolve disputes of fact. This was clarified\nat the hearing, suggesting that an adjournment until a date before the end\nof July 2025 could allow the hearing of evidence from Durkan (0r at least,\na witness statement from Durkan be provided) as to progress on the\noutstanding items of which remain disputed and whether an application\nhas yet been made to the Building Safety Regulator.\n24. The application was opposed by the Applicants.\n25. In an oral decision delivered to the parties at the hearing, the application\nfor an adjournment was refused. While the Tribunal has power under our\ncase management powers to order an adjournment, it was not considered\nthat it would be in the interests of justice or in accordance with the\noverriding objective to do so. In particular:\n(1) The Respondent’s application is grounded on the premise of an\nopen-ended extension, which the Tribunal cannot order (for\nthe reasons fleshed out above but indicated to the parties at the\nhearing). An adjournment to facilitate curing that fundamental\njurisdictional point should not be granted lightly.\n(2) The Respondent has already put in detailed written evidence in\nsupport of its application for the Tribunal’s consideration. .\n(3) Moreover, a month had passed since the application had been\nmade, during which the Respondent could have sought\nanswers from Durkan or obtained a witness statement from\nthem.\n8\n\n(4) It is readily apparent that no real progress has been made\nbetween Durkan and the Respondent in the period between the\nmaking of the application and the hearing.\n(5) There is no guarantee that Durkan would agree the two\noutstanding issues before the reconvened hearing, nor that\nthere would necessarily be clarity as to when an application\nwould be made to the Building Safety Regulator.\n(6) Further, even taking the Respondent’s evidence at its highest,\ngiven the lack of progress since the original Order, it would be\ndifficult to conclude that either the Tribunal or the Applicant’s\ncould be confident of swift progress or that varying the Order\nwould be reasonable, even were the Tribunal in receipt of\nevidence from Durkan.\n(7) As such, the obtaining of a witness statement from Durkan\nwould not provide a complete answer to the fundamental\ndifficulties with the application.\n26. In the circumstances, it was not considered proportionate or in the\ninterests of justice to grant an adjournment. We find that the Tribunal\nshould determine the application based on the evidence before it.\nDetermination of the Respondent’s application\n27. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out above, we are not satisfied\neither that we have jurisdiction to make the order sought, or that it would\nbe reasonable to vary the original Order to give the Respondent an\nextension of time were the jurisdictional point cured. Mr Sawtell\nimpressed on the Tribunal the importance of taking account of the\npractical consequences of either granting or refusing the application. We\nare acutely mindful of the fact that the principal concern is that the\nbuilding be remediated and the position remains that this has not been\ndone. In this regard, we also take into account the submissions of Ms\nMistry that she cannot agree to the extension sought for the reasons\n9\n\nalready given and that her preferred course is now instead to seek\nenforcement in the County Court.\n28. Accordingly, the Respondent’s application is refused.\nJudge N Carr\nName: Date: 2 July 2025\nJudge Sheftel\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the Tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the Regional Office which has been dealing with the case.

This order should be read together with the order and reasons given in\nthe connected application for disclosure pursuant to section 107(1)\nCommonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, of the same date.\nB. The property is a building containing two residential flats on the first\nand second floors, and a commercial unit at ground level. Ms Fallios is\nthe long-leaseholder of Flat 2. The other long-leaseholder is Mr Allan\nMeldrum (Flat 1). Together, they formed the Applicant right to manage\ncompany.\nC. A claim notice in respect of the property, dated 13 March 2025, was\ngiven to Assethold Limited, Eagerstates Limited, and Mr Ronni Gurvits\nby first-class post on 14 March 2025. The leaseholders of the ground\nfloor unit were also given a copy of the notice.\nD. By email dated 15 March 2025, Scott Cohen solicitors made a number\nof enquiries that were responded to on 27 March 2025 by the\nApplicant’s then-representative, The Leasehold Advice Centre. There\nwas no further response and no counternotice.\nE. The date of acquisition specified in the claim notice was 25 July 2025.\nBy reason of the lack of counternotice, the Applicant acquired the right\nto manage on that date by operation of law.\nF. By application dated 5 August 2025, the Applicant sought order both\nunder section 94(3) and section 107 Commonhold and Leasehold\nReform Act 2002 (‘the Act’).\nG. On 8 September 2025, the Tribunal gave Directions for both parties in\nrelation to those applications.\nH. By paragraph (8) of those Directions, the Tribunal identified the\ndocuments sought by the Applicant by its section 93 Notice given to the\nRespondent on 30 May 2025, to which the Applicant received no\nresponse.\nI. By direction 2 of those Directions, the Tribunal required the\nRespondent to give disclosure to the Applicant of documents including\nthose set out by the Applicant identified in paragraph (8) therein, as\nfollows:\nRespondent’s Statement of Case\n2. By 4pm on 6 October 2025 the Respondent must send to the\nApplicant by email a full Statement of Case in response to the\napplication, which must include the following:\n(a) (i) A copy of the buildings insurance policy or\nsummary of cover, a copy of the current schedule and\n2\n\nevidence of payment of the premium for the current\nyear\n(ii) Brief details of the claims history for the last 3\nyears;\n(b) Service charge accounts for the past three years;\n(c) A full summary of the service charge account as\nat the date the Applicant acquired the right to\nmanage, including full details of the amount held;\n(d) Interim accounts for the period from December 2024 to\n25 July 2025 (if not finalised and disclosed in accordance\nwith paragraph (c) above);\n(e) Details of any reserve funds held on account ion\nrespect of each flat;\n(f) Details of any monies held on account which have not\nbeen expended;\n(g) Bank account statements for the 12-month period\npre-dating acquisition of the right to manage;\n(h) All relevant correspondence;\n(i) A statement setting out any submissions the Respondent\nrelies on. In particular, the Respondent must:\n(i) Identify which sums it accepts are due to the\nApplicant;\n(ii) Identify any service charges which the Respondent\nsays are committed, and therefore not payable to\nthe Applicant under section 94(3) of the Act;\n(iii) identify the percentages of service charges\npayable in respect of each flat contained at the\npremises;\n(iii) set out the facts and legal arguments on which it\nrelies, enclosing copies of any case law which it requires\nthe Tribunal to take into account, in making its\ndetermination;\n(j) Any witness statement(s) of fact on which the Respondent\nrelies (witness statements should identify the name and\nreference number of the case, have numbered paragraphs and\nend with a statement of truth and the signature of the witness.\nOriginal witness statements should be brought to the hearing.\nIn addition, witnesses are expected to attend the hearing to be\ncross-examined as to their evidence, unless their statement has\nbeen agreed by the other party); and\n(k) All other documents on which it relies.\n3\n\nJ. The Respondent failed to comply, and the Applicant sought a debarring\norder on 13 October 2025, citing the Respondent’s failure. The\nRespondent also did not reply to that application.\nK. By two Notices, each dated 20 October 2025, the Tribunal indicated (1)\nits intention to debar the Respondent from further participation in the\naccrued uncommitted service charges application, and (2) its intention\nto make an order under section 107(1) and (3) of the Commonhold and\nLeasehold Reform Act 2002, on the Respondent’s failure to provide the\ndocuments reasonably required by the Applicant by its section 93\nNotice given on 30 May 2025.\nL. The Tribunal observed in its reasons:\nThe documents are ones the Applicant is entitled to. They have been\nrequired to be given to the Applicant since June 2025. The Respondent\nhas now failed to comply with the Applicant’s statutory notice and the\nTribunal’s own directions. These are documents that the Applicant\nrequires for the proper ongoing management of the premises over\nwhich it has acquired the right to manage, in the exercise of which it is\nbeing obstructed by the Respondent’s non-compliance.\nM. The Respondent’s response was required by 4pm on 4 November 2025.\nN. By application for an ‘extension of time’ received in the afternoon of 4\nNovember 2025, after a series of emails from 4pm 3 November 2025 in\nwhich Mr Gurvits on behalf of the Respondent sought to persuade the\ncase officer that the two orders were contradictory and that the\nRespondent could not answer until the case officer confirmed which\nwas the correct to answer, Mr Gurvits sought an order as follows (in\nbold):\n6. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION OR REQUEST AND\nTHE ORDER THAT YOU WISH THE TRIBUNAL TO MAKE (ie\npostponement, extend/vary/amend directions, debar evidence)\nextension of time to provide response\n7. GROUNDS/REASONS FOR APPLICATION OR REQUEST\nthere are 2 sets of directions which in essence are\ncontradictory. It is not clear which is correct. We require\nclear directions and then an extension of time to comply with\nany direction\nO. Those were the full contents of the application.\nP. By its order dated The Tribunal found that the Respondent’s conduct in\nthe extension application was inhibiting the Tribunal from dealing with\nthese proceedings fairly and justly. Nevertheless, it extended time for\n4\n\ncompliance to 13 November 2025, subject to ‘unless’ provisions, as\nfollows:\nUnless by 4pm on Thursday 13 November 2025, the\nRespondent makes a full response to each of the two Notices dated 20\nOctober 2025, as required by each order, by separate dated and\nsigned witness statements in response addressing the\nRespondent’s various failures to comply with the Applicant’s section\n93 notice and the Tribunal’s directions dated 8 September 2025, no\nfurther consideration will be given to the Respondent's\nresponses and the debarring and compliance orders will be\ndetermined absent them.\nQ. The Respondent has made no response.\nR. The unless order has therefore taken effect.\nDebarring\nS. The Respondent has had three opportunities from the Tribunal to\ncomply with the directions as required, in addition to the original\nsection 93 notice requiring much of the disclosure identified.\nT. The Respondent’s conduct is contemptuous of both the Tribunal and\nthe leaseholders, and is either designed to or has the effect of\nfrustrating the Applicant from exercising its legal rights.\nU. The Respondent therefore stands debarred from participation in the\napplication for determination of the accrued uncommitted service\ncharges.\nAccrued uncommitted service charges - Decision\nV. The Tribunal is therefore entitled to, and does, proceed to determine\nthis issue summarily on the basis of the Applicant’s documents alone,\npursuant to rule 9(8) of the Tribunal Procedure (First Tier Tribunal)\n(Property Chamber) Rules 2013.\nW. The Respondent’s conduct is not only contemptuous, but also self-\ndefeating. The natural inference to be drawn, absent any explanation\nwhatsoever from the Respondent, is that the Respondent’s refusal to\ncomply is that it is unwilling or unable to do so.\nX. That inference is supported by a letter, submitted by the Applicant,\nfrom Eagerstates to the solicitors for Ms Fiallos’s co-director, Mr\nMeldrum. Mr Meldrum is trying to sell his Flat. In the letter dated 19\nNovember 2025, as well as demanding £570 in “administration costs”\nin addition to £270 for preparing a Deed of Covenant”, Eagerstates\ndemands “£15,222.15” which is says is an “outstanding amount”, for\nwhich it includes no demands, invoices, accounts or other proof that\nthe sum is due, nor identification of what it is in connection with. On\n5\n\nquerying from solicitors, those solicitors have been told that accounts\n“will be prepared”.\n2. This Tribunal is not able to offer advice, as sought by the Applicant, as\nto what to do in what appears to be this ‘ransom’ situation. Mr\nMeldrum has his own solicitors to whom he should turn for advice.\n3. It is open to this Tribunal to find, and it does find, however, that on the\nbalance of probabilities, given the absence of any evidence whatsoever\nfrom the Respondent, its failure to respond to paragraph 2(i) of the\ndirections dated 8 September 2025 in particular leads to the conclusion\nthat there are no sums which are or were on 25 July 2025 committed\nin the reserve or service charge holdings for the property.\n4. The difficulty the Tribunal has in ascertaining that sum is the\nRespondent’s abject refusal to comply with its directions to enable it to\ncomplete its task.\n5. I therefore make the finding that the whole of the sums held in the\nservice and reserve fund accounts on 25 July 2025 are due\nand payable by the Respondent to the Applicant.\n6. In the event that the Applicant is enabled to find a more precise sum as\na consequence of the Respondent’s compliance with the associated\ndisclosure order under section 107(1) sent together with this decision,\nor any enforcement thereof in the County Court, I give them permission\nto apply to amend the sum in the order to s specified sum.\n7. Any such application may be made by form order1 using the current\ncase number, explaining the request and providing any order of the\nCounty Court or written admission of the Respondent in which that\nsum is identified.\nDisclosure Order\n8. A separate order under section 107(1) of the Commonhold and\nLeasehold Reform Act 2002, enforceable in the county court,\naccompanies this Order. It continues to oblige the Respondent to take\naction.\n9. If the Respondent failed to comply, the Tribunal will transfer it to the\nCounty Court to take action, which may include injunctive relief (failure\nto comply with which may well lead to contempt proceedings).\nName: Judge N Carr Date: 26 November 2025\n6\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the Tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the Tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n7"

The façade at Centre Point comprises an unsafe cladding system\nto which paragraph 8 of Schedule 8 applies;\nb. The presumption in paragraph 13(2) of schedule 8 applies to flat\nnumbers 5, 11, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34 and 35 (‘those\nflats’) that they are held under qualifying leases;\nc. No service charge or reserve fund is therefore recoverable from\nthe lessees of those flats in respect of the Proposed Scheme, by\nvirtue of paragraphs 8 and 10(2)(a) of schedule 8; and\nd. No service charge or reserve fund is therefore recoverable from\nthe lessees of those flats in respect of the QLTA, by virtue of\nparagraphs 8 and/or 10(2)(a) of schedule 8;\n(4) Any costs incurred in respect of the Proposed Scheme or QLTA, that\nwould otherwise be recoverable in respect of the residential leases by\nvirtue of section 27A(3), would therefore not be recoverable from the\nleaseholders of those flats listed in (3)b. above.\nREASONS\n(a) Introduction\n1. Centre Point Tower, sitting at the intersection of New Oxford Street, Charing\nCross Road and St Giles High Street in WC2H and at the crossroads of Oxford\nStreet and Tottenham Court Road, was commissioned by millionaire property\ntycoon Harry Hyams during the commercial rents boom of the early 1960s. It\nwas one of the first London skyscrapers to be developed. It was a controversial\ndevelopment. Many questioned how permission was granted by the local\nauthority for the 34-storey Tower in the then-relatively low-rise London\nskyline on a busy traffic junction. It was designed by Richard Seifert and\nPartners, engineered by Pell Frischmann, and constructed by Wimpey during\n1963 – 1966.\n2. Mr Hyams was determined that it would be occupied by a single commercial\ntenant, and it remained empty until 1975. In 1974, it was unlawfully occupied\nfor a short period by housing activists, including Jim Radford, Ron Bailey, and\nthe late Mr John Eugene Joseph Dromey (known as Jack; later to become an\n4\n\nMP who continued in the campaign for housing), in protest over the vast space\nremaining unoccupied while a housing crisis deepened, and people slept\nrough at its doorstep. The charity Centrepoint, set up by Reverend Ken Leech\nin the basement of St Anne’s church in Soho in the shadow of the Tower, took\nits name from the building, calling it an “affront to homelessness”. In 1995 it,\nand its neighbouring buildings in the estate, were given Grade II listing status.\n3. This case is about its humbler but no less experimental neighbour, Centre\nPoint House, 15A St Giles High Street, London WC2H 8LW (‘CPH’). Little is\nknown about why it was constructed or Mr Hyams’ intentions in respect of it.\nIt is thought by the experts in this case that perhaps CPH was intended also to\nbe leased by whichever single wealthy commercial occupant Mr Hyams had in\nmind, possibly to offer on-site overnight accommodation for its employees. It\ntoo appears to have lain empty for a very substantial period. It is believed that\nin or around 1987 the substantial part of CPH was finally converted to\nresidential leasehold flats.\n4. It is, we are told, a matter of some debate even as between experts as to the\nnumber of storeys at Centre Point House, but it is convenient to describe it as\nhaving 8 floors. CPH is a six-storey podium situated atop, and is separate\nfrom, the two-storey or double-height units of restaurant/retail units below.\nWhen we refer in this decision to CPH, it is to this residential part.\n5. CPH is connected with Centre Point Tower by a ‘link’ building, which is also\ncommercial/retail/restaurant space. Within the six residential storeys are\nsituated 36 duplex flats, which interlock with each other ‘Tetris’-like in a\nstepped-L pattern [ExB 373]. There is no number 13, and so the numbers run\nfrom 1 at the lowest storey to 37 at the upper. Entrance corridors are on the\n3rd, 5th and 7th floors only, onto north and south stair cores (which form no\npart of this application). We understand that 10 flats are retained in the\nownership of Almacantar Group Limited. The remainder are in residential\noccupation by their owners or sub-tenants.\n6. Each of the flats has a projecting balcony. The east and west elevations\ncomprise timber framed glazing and a spandrel glazing ‘wrap’ around the\nprojecting balconies (accessed by a timber sliding door set into the glazed\nscreen), formed by an internal timber ladder frame, with external aluminium\npressure plates, glazing panels, and window lights.\n7. The framing system is unusual, in that the dominant structural element is at\nthe horizontal instead of the vertical. It appears to have been factory\nassembled in units 3 meters wide by 1 storey tall. 3 meters equates to two\nglazing frames. The upper horizontal frame sits on a metal bracket. It is\nthought that was intended to be a temporary support, until a dwarf wall\n(blockwork or concrete) was built up and a bed of mortar laid between the\nhorizontal timber frame and it, onto which the glazing was then installed.\nMortise and tenon joints join the vertical members into the structure. The\nhorizontal members are only fixed back to the building at the ends, by metal\nrestraint fixings designed to take wind load.\n5\n\n8. Externally, distinct ‘tramline’ patterns appear where pairs of vertical frames\nadjunct, situated at party wall locations. The tramlines and staggered vertical\nframes are part of the architectural features protected by grade II listing.\nWhere the glazed façade passes between party walls or floor slabs, glazed\nback-painted annealed glass spandrel panels have been inserted. Behind each\nof the spandrel panels is a thin layer of polystyrene insulation, and then a gap\nbefore the dwarf blockwork or concrete wall, behind and onto which the\nwindow lights are fixed.\n9. The window lights (of which there are both large and small) are made up of a\nmixture of original and replacement frames, some of which are now\naluminium. It is not known when replacements or repairs might have been\nmade in respect each individual flat.\n10. The glazing was constructed by pressing glazing tape against the timber\nframes, pressing the glass panels onto the tape, and then applying two layers\nof glazing tape to aluminium clamp strips which are aligned with the frame\nand pressed to the outside of the glass. Fixing screws are then driven in and\ntightened to ensure that the clamp strip is fixed tight against the nosing of\ntimber at the front edge of the frame. Joints are then sealed with mastic.\n11. The difficulty with this construction is that small gaps between the pressure\nplates to allow for movement between adjunct frames will result in water\ningress, as do any screw holes in respect of which the sealant has failed. Once\nwater is in the system, there is limited ability for it to evaporate off (as it\nwould in a normal timber system), as it is sealed in by the impervious\naluminium clamp strip, glass and glazing tape. It therefore remains in the\ntimber, forming interstitial condensation which in turn leads to degradation\nand (eventually) rot of the timber members. Further over-sealing the system\nwill only keep such water as has made its way past the gaps in the system,\nexacerbating the problem and promoting further decay.\n12. The façade experts agree that this process will have been occurring since the\nminute CPH was built. The design is inherently defective.\n13. It is proposed by the Applicants that in order to resolve this problem a steel\nstick curtain wall system including bespoke steel hollow section frames with\nintegrated double glazed vision panels and opaque insulated spandrel panels\nbe superimposed on the existing timbers and fixed to the concrete structural\nframe, rendering those timbers non-structural (‘the Proposed Scheme’) [EvB\n1332]. There is a considerable amount of detail about the Proposed Scheme,\nand the façade experts in this case agree it is the best – and realistically only –\nsolution to the problem.\n(b) Procedural History\n14. By an application dated 4 January 2023, and sent to the Tribunal on 9\nJanuary 2023, the Applicants applied to the Tribunal pursuant to section\n27A(3) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (‘the 1985 Act’). The Applicants’\n19-page statement of case accompanied that application.\n6\n\n15. By letter of 19 January 2023, the Tribunal convened a case management\nhearing (‘CMH’) on 7 February 2023 by video (CVP). On 26 January 2023,\nJudge Vance refused a request, made by Ms Laura Stedman, that the CMH be\nadjourned. Further applications to adjourn, made by Mr Simon Ogilvie, Mr\nVas Hava (on behalf of CID Investments) and Mr Derek Savage (by his power\nof attorney, Ms Nichola Hutchens) were refused by Judge Hawkes on 3\nFebruary 2023, in which letter Judge Hawkes explained what the CMH was\nfor and that the main dispute would not be determined at it.\n16. At that CMH, Judge Nicola Rushton KC heard from Ms Harriet Holmes of\ncounsel for the Applicant. Mr Ogilvie, Mr Innes Catto and Mr Ali Negyal, Mr\nHava on behalf of CID Investments, Mr Henry and Mrs Ranjou Oh, Mr Chia\nYen Huang, Ms Stedman, Mr Edward Laws, Mr Hans Patel on behalf of Xavier\nProperty Management, Mr Mukesh (Mike) Patel on behalf of Ginger Global\nLtd, Mrs Caroline Weeks (represented by Mr Oliver Weeks), Ms Maureen\nHarmon for Harmon Properties Two Ltd, and Ms Stella Meadows were\npresent for the Respondents. Mrs Inge Woolf, Ms Penelope DeValk, and Mr\nMohammed Fahed Jaber Alharthi were not present, but were represented by\nMr Negyal, Mr Catto or Mr Ogilvie.\n17. Judge Rushton KC identified a number of issues that were likely to require\ndetermination, which issues were, of course, identified prior to the\nRespondents providing their statements of case, and prior to the majority\nobtaining legal advice in these proceedings.\n18. Directions were sent to the parties on 9 February 2023. Those directions\nincluded a listing for a Pre-Trial Review (‘PTR’) and for a five-day final\nhearing, on dates to be notified to the parties on receipt of their dates to avoid.\n19. On 27 February 2023, Mr Catto made an application pursuant to section 20C\nof the 1985 Act, on his own behalf and on behalf of all the other leaseholders.\nOther leaseholders repeated the application, but it is clear that Mr Catto’s\napplication was made with the other leaseholders’ knowledge and consent.\n20. Having received dates to avoid, I amended Judge Rushton KC’s directions to\nextend time for the Respondents’ replies at the request of Mr Ogilvie, and\nlisted the PTR for 21 November 2023, with a five-day hearing to take place\nbetween 29 January – 2 February 2024. Those amended directions were sent\nunder cover of a letter addressing various matters on 21 March 2023, which\nalso identified in its last line the PTR date.\n21. By letter dated 5 April 2023, Forsters LLP wrote to notify that it was now\ninstructed by Ms DeValk, Mr and Mrs Harmon, Mr Chauhan, Mr Huang, Mr\nCatto and Mr Ali, Mrs Weeks, Mike Patel, Hans Patel, CID Investments, Mr\nAlharthi, Mr Doran, Mr Laws, Ms Meadows, Mrs Woolf, and Mr and Mrs Oh.\nOn 2 June 2023, Forsters wrote to clarify that it also represented Mr Savage,\nand that insofar as Messrs Patel and Mr and Mrs Harmon were concerned, it\nin fact represented Ginger Global, Xavier Management, and Harmon\nProperties Two.\n7\n\n22. On 11 June 2023, Mr Ogilvie, by an email from his son, requested a further\nlink to the Applicants’ Reply to the leaseholders’ cases (as now variously\nrepresented) and the accompanying 2840 pages of documents on which it\nproposed to rely (those having been sent in accordance with directions). The\nApplicants re-provided it the following day. On 24 June 2023, Mr Ogilvie\nmade an application for a further extension for, amongst other things,\nadditional time to give disclosure in accordance with the directions. I granted\nthat application on 29 June 2023, permitting Mr Ogilvie additional time to\nprovide his disclosure, and indicated to the parties that a further application\nfor extensions of time for exchange of witness statements would be granted,\nshould Mr Ogilvie’s disclosure materially affect that next step in the timetable.\nAs anticipated, on 10 August 2023 I granted the additional extension for\nwitness statements at the parties’ request and provided to the parties re-\namended Directions under cover of letter dated 10 August 2023.\n23. Throughout September, Forsters and Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner (‘BCLP’)\nendeavoured to agree directions for additional quantity surveying evidence\n(‘the QS evidence’). I provided re-reamended directions for expert evidence, as\nagreed between the parties but subject to additional requirements (in\nparticular, statements of agreed facts and disputed issues) on 10 October\n2023. By agreement, the parties extended the dates for the QS evidence.\n24. At the PTR on 21 November 2023, Ms Holmes attended for the Applicants,\naccompanied by three instructing solicitors. Mr Stedman attended on behalf\nof Ms Stedman by telephone (the intention was that he would attend by video,\nbut unfortunately there appeared to be a compatibility issue with the device he\nwas using). Mr Simon Allison of counsel attended for the Forsters-represented\nleaseholders, accompanied by his instructing solicitor, Ms Kaleigh Moreton.\nMr Ogilvie did not attend. We were not informed why, but were informed by\nMs Moreton that she had been in recent contact with him. We note that we\nhave been aware of Mr Ogilvie’s personal circumstances throughout these\nproceedings.\n25. Various issues were covered off in the PTR, such that the list of issues was\nrefined by reference to the Respondents’ various cases as follows:\na. Whether the proposed works amount to works of repair\nfalling within the Applicants’ repair obligations set out in the\nleases;\nb. Whether the proposed works amount to repairs or\nimprovements, or to a separate/divisible combination of\nrepairs and improvements, and if (to any extent) they are\nimprovements whether they would fall within the Applicants’\nrepairing obligations under the leases;\nc. Whether the Applicants have breached those repairing\nobligations it is under by the leases, by failing to carry out\nrepair works when it acquired the freehold or in or around\n2017 or otherwise;\n8\n\nd. If the Applicants have breached those repairing obligations,\nwhether those breaches have caused loss and damage to the\nRespondents that should be set off against the cost of the\nworks;\ne. Whether the Applicants failed to consider, or to properly\nconsider, any other reasonable alternative option for\nrepairing the façade, either when it acquired the freehold or\nsubsequently, and if so what is the impact of that failure on\nthe decision on the scheme of works and the cost of it;\nf. Whether the proposed cost of the proposed works is in any\nevent reasonable, and if not, what would be the reasonable\ncost;\ng. Whether the proposed façade works are a reasonable\nsolution to the Applicants’ repairing obligations (it is noted\nthat neither the specified Respondents nor Ms Stedman\npursue this point. It is left within this list in case Mr Ogilvie\nwishes to pursue it);\nh. Whether the proposed apportionment of the cost of the\nproposed works in the retained parts is not a fair proportion,\nand if not what would be a fair proportion, within the\nmeaning of the leases that the Applicants’ should be limited\nto (as above, neither the specified Respondents nor Ms\nStedman pursue this point. It is left within this list in case Mr\nOgilvie wishes to pursue it)\ni. Whether some or all of the Respondents hold qualifying\nleases within the meaning of section 117 of the Building\nSafety Act 2022 (‘the 2022 Act’) and the façade is within the\ndefinition of ‘cladding’ in paragraph 8(2) of schedule 8 of the\n2022 Act, if so whether no costs in respect of the proposed\nworks are in any event payable by the Respondents in\nrespect of those leases, pursuant to paragraph 8(1) of\nschedule 8 of the 2022 Act;\nj. Whether any order under section 20C of the 1985 Act should\nbe made.\n26. At the PTR, Mr Allison informed us (myself and Regional Surveyor Helen\nBowers) that the Forsters-represented leaseholders no longer pursued a., b.,\ne., g., and h., in light of various information arising (not least of which was the\nreport received from Mr Lawrence Gray, the Forsters-represented\nleaseholders’ Façade Expert, agreeing with Dr Richard Harris, the Applicants’\nFaçade Expert, that the only reasonable remedy of the problems with the\nfaçade is to overclad it). Those issues were nevertheless left as potential issues\nin the directions, as a form of a. and/or b. was pursued by Ms Stedman, e.\nmight be, and Mr Ogilvie’s position in his pleaded case was unclear.\n9\n\n27. At that PTR, we also enquired whether the Applicants had sought leaseholder\ncertificates in light of the Building Safety Act 2022 (‘the 2022 Act’) arguments.\nThey confirmed they had not. We required that the Forsters-represented\nleaseholders identify which of them was said to hold a qualifying lease for the\nschedule 8 paragraph 8 argument that was to be pursued by them.\n28. We further noted as follows: “there is as yet no quantification by the\nRespondents of the amount of any set off that they say arises through the\nasserted delay by the Applicants to address the disrepair in the façade. The\nQuantity Surveyors have yet to meet. As indicated by Mr Allison, the\nspecified Respondents’ position will be formalised after that meeting. The\nspecified Respondents are encouraged to do so as soon as possible. We\nindicated that doing so by skeleton argument days before the hearing would\nnot be welcome nor sufficient for the Applicants to prepare for the case\nagainst them.”\n29. We set out the hearing arrangements, including which witnesses would attend\non what days, in anticipation that the numbers of attendees would outstrip the\nnumber of seats available in the hearing room available to us, such that a\nsecond ‘observation’ room would be required at Alfred Place for witnesses not\nimmediately giving their evidence. With the PTR directions, we also asked\nnon-participating observers to indicate whether they had video facilities so\nthat they could join by hybrid means. We further notified the parties that we\nconsidered that an inspection should be held a week before the hearing.\n30. Arrangements were confirmed by correspondence after the PTR, including\nfixing of the inspection on 22 January 2024 and arrangements for attendance.\nThe Forsters-represented leaseholders also made an application to substitute\ntheir quantity surveying expert. I gave permission for Mr Oliver Blowey to\nattend in Mr Sullivan’s stead by letter dated 14 December 2023.\n31. By a series of letters between 5 – 11 January 2024, Forsters notified that it no\nlonger acted for any leaseholder except Mr Doran. I sent a series of letters to\nthe leaseholders to seek clarity over who intended to attend at the hearing in\nperson or remotely by video, who they wished to present their case at the\nhearing, and who was likely to be representing them at the inspection. I then\nlisted an emergency CMH to take place after the inspection on 22 January\n2024, to ensure that adequate preparations were made, and to explore with\nthe formerly-represented leaseholders their understanding of the concessions\nmade on their behalf when represented, to ensure that there were no\nadditional matters that needed to be addressed and to maintain the\neffectiveness of the hearing. Mr Ogilive was also notified of these\narrangements by post. The parties were invited to notify the Tribunal of their\nattendance at the inspection and CMH.\n32. The inspection took place on 22 January 2024 and was attended by the\nfollowing: myself, Ms Bowers and Mr Ian Holdsworth; Ms Alex Selka, Solicitor\n(BCLP), Dr Richard Harris, façade expert, and Mr James Waite, Project\nDirector at Almacantar, all for the Applicants; Mr Allison and Ms Moreton for\nMr Doran, together with Mr Allison’s pupil Mr Thompson; Mr Stedman for\n10\n\nMs Stedman; Mr Catto for himself and Mr Negyal, Mrs Woolf, Mr Alharthi,\nMr Huang, Mr and Mrs Oh, Ms Meadows, Ginger Global, Xavier Management,\nand Mr Laws; Mr Hava for CID Investments, and for Mr Savage, Harmon\nProperties Two, and Ms DeValk; Mr Weeks for Mrs Weeks; and Mr Gray for\nall of the formerly represented Respondents except Mr Doran (who had not\nrequired his attendance). Mr Ogilvie had not replied and did not attend.\n33. At the emergency CMH after the inspection, the same individuals attended in\naddition to Ms Holmes and a further solicitor, Ms Rachel Katz, for the\nApplicant. Mr Ogilvie had not replied and did not attend. Ms Meadows also\nattended and assisted Mr Catto in his submissions.\n34. At the emergency CMH, we made clear to the formerly-represented\nleaseholders that we would not, without good reason, re-open the concessions\nthat had been made at the PTR. No party asked us to.\n35. We raised with the Applicants the difficulties we envisaged with certain parts\nof their application, which we will cover in more detail below. We also made\nclear that the Tribunal had still not received what was said to be the basis of\nany quantum of set-off on either Mr Doran’s behalf or anyone else’s. The\nApplicant notified that some data and spreadsheet calculations, with which it\ntook issue, had been provided to BCLP on the previous Thursday. We required\nthat they be sent to us. Mr Allison notified that Mr Blowey was now instructed\nonly on behalf of Mr Doran for reasons that could not be disclosed. We\nreceived spreadsheets on 23 January 2024.\n36. We invited the formerly-represented leaseholders to consider whether their\ninterests and arguments were ‘as one’, such that a single spokesperson could\nbe appointed to present their case. We were also invited to extend time for\nskeleton arguments to 4pm on Wednesday 24 January 2024, which we did,\nand they were provided accordingly.\n37. On the morning of the hearing, a long email and letter was provided to us\nfrom Mr Ogilive. In it, he requested to attend at the hearing by video\nconferencing. He also supplied further written evidence, and requested that he\nbe permitted to make pre-recorded videos to give evidence, and that the\nApplicants be refused permission to cross examine him, for the reasons he\ngave and which we understand. At the outset of the hearing, we explained that\nMr Ogilvie would not be permitted to rely on new evidence now. We would\nallow him to rely on his written statement of case, however, and not to be\ncross-examined on it. He would, at the end of the hearing, be permitted to\nmake a closing statement, in writing or orally, dealing with the evidence that\nhe had heard and the difference it made to his written position, although he\nwould not be permitted to give new evidence. In the end, Mr Ogilvie elected to\ngive an oral closing statement.\n38. For the hearing, we were provided with three (digital; 13 in hard-copy)\nbundles in accordance with the directions: a core bundle; an evidence bundle;\nand an expert bundle. We refer to pages in them throughout as [CB…],\n[EvB…], and [ExB…] respectively. We were also provided with the\nApplicant’s skeleton argument which will be referred to as [SkelA…], Mr\n11\n\nDoran’s skeleton argument [SkelD…], and Mr Ali Negyal’s skeleton\nargument on behalf of the formerly-represented leaseholders, of which we\nwere provided a revised version prior to closing submissions [SkelN…].\nAdditional drawings of the wall make up for the proposed works to be carried\nout at CPH found at [EvB972 – 974] were provided in larger form and\ncontaining the descriptions of the elements from the missing legend from the\nsmaller A4 pages, and will be referred to as [SK024], [SK025], and\n[SK026]. Authorities bundles were also provided by the Applicants and Mr\nAllison, which will be referred to as [AAB…] and [DAB…] respectively. We\nwere provided with, but in the end did not make use of, the spreadsheet\ncalculations referred to at the emergency CMH, for reasons that we set out\nbelow.\n39. In total there were around 7,000 pages. We are grateful to the parties for the\ncare with which they presented their cases to ensure that we were referred to\nrelevant documents. We wish to give Mr Negyal particular recognition, as\ndespite being drafted in at the eleventh hour he diligently and deftly managed\nto present the case for his fellow formerly-represented leaseholders, despite\nthe weight of that responsibility, and despite the whole group not being in\ntotal agreement with each other rendering his position particularly difficult.\n(c) Background to the dispute\n40. MEPC UK Ltd was the freeholder of the Centre Point estate up until late 2000.\nIn late 1999 it commissioned investigations into the state of repair of the\nfaçade at CPH.\n41. On 13 January 2000, Ove Arup & Partners (‘Arup’), reported [EvB 33-46]\nthat:\n“the curtain wall to the flats is in poor condition. In the short term, opening\nup is recommended in order to assess the condition of concealed components.\nThere are grounds for concern about the wellbeing of these until shown\notherwise… It is considered likely that replacement of the curtain wall to the\nflats with a new system meeting present day standards will be required…”.\nArup discovered “many incidences of dampness in the external walls”, and\ncommented that “the design performance of the curtain wall is considered to\nbe basic by present day standards…”. Arup considered that “[t]he curtain\nwall has broken down severely both in appearance and performance. This\nstate of affairs may have prevailed over a number of years. Evidence of\nmoisture penetration was seen. Some of this may originate from\ncondensation as well as rainwater leakage. Attempts to address this have\nbeen made with extensive sealant work. At best we would expect short-term\nsuccess from this approach. It is not a lasting or fully effective solution. We\nwould expect the condition to deteriorate further even if sealant work were\ncontinued. Furthermore, if the source of some of the moisture is\ncondensation, the application of further sealant to the outside of the building\nwill not help matters and may indeed make things worse.”\n42. Arup considered a number of measures that might be considered to remediate\nthe problem. Amongst those considerations, it considered whether taking\n12\n\napart the existing system and rebuilding it would be a reasonable approach.\nArup was of the view it was not:\n“6.1.2 Take the existing curtain wall apart and rebuild it\nThis approach amounts to taking the existing curtain wall apart, then\nrebuilding it as a replica of its former self. The existing curtain wall would be\ntaken apart by removing the cover strips and the glazing. This would leave\nthe supporting mullions and transoms and internal linings. Any components\nin still reasonable condition could be salvaged for reuse. However, failed\nparts or items not economic to remove and refurbish, would be replaced with\nnew. In addition to the failed parts already known not to be reusable, there\nwould be a high expectation of breakage. Depending on the condition of the\nrevealed mullions, transoms and brackets and firestopping these may also\nneed replacement with new components. Re-assembly of cover strips would\nprobably require an amended design to overcome shortcomings in\nwatertightness of the existing arrangement and to allow some ventilation\nagainst condensation.\nIt is not the intention of this scheme to upgrade the designed performance.\nWhilst the scheme represents a ‘conservation’ approach, this will not remedy\nthe shortcomings from the curtain wall in comfort levels for the occupants. It\nwould be a costly undertaking with disruption and may not last longer in the\nfuture than the existing design has done in the past. This approach is often\nimpossible to achieve satisfactorily as it is unlikely that exactly matching\nspandrel glass and cover strips are still available. This approach is not\nfavoured for these reasons.”\n43. Arup concluded that the preferable approach would be to reclad the façade\nusing a different system. At 6.1.4:\n“This approach would involve completely removing the existing curtain wall\nand replacing it with a new system throughout. The new system could be\ndesigned to observe the same panel sizes and arrangement and present\noutwardly surfaces of similar materials and appearance to those in the\nexisting curtain wall… The new system would be purpose designed to\naccommodate double glazed units and insulated spandrel panels and to\nachieve present day standards of weathertightness, thermal insulation, noise\nreduction, firestopping and ventilation and safety.\nIt is envisaged that the curtain wall could be based on a standard system\nrather than a bespoke design. Whilst a simple curtain wall stick system\nmight suffice, a unitised system might be installed more efficiently and so be\na better choice in terms of speed of installation.\nWhilst this approach appears to have the most disruption, this is probably\nnot much greater than [removing the curtain wall and rebuilding it to modern\nday standards] and may be of shorter duration. The cost of both is likely to be\nin similar order of magnitude but the value for money is greatest with this\ncomplete reclad in that there is certainty of meeting present day levels of\nperformance.”\n13\n\n44. MEPC sold the Centre Point estate to Blackmoor LP (a property investment\nconsortium led by Portfolio Holdings) in late 2000, which held the freehold\nduring the period 2000 – 2005. Its plan appears to be to develop a restaurant\nat the top of the Tower, accessed by an exterior lift (amongst other things). It\nis not known what, if anything, Blackmoor LP did in consequence of the Arup\nreport. There is evidence of a Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (‘the 1985 Act’)\nsection 20 Notice of Intention dated 20 July 2005, with a number of line items\nreferring to windows, frames and glass cladding [EvB 48]. However, in the\nsame year Blackmoor LP sold the estate to Targetfollow for £85million.\n45. It appears that Targetfollow had revitalisation plans for the estate, including\nCPH. Targetfollow commissioned its own reports into CPH. Arup (now ‘Arup\nFaçade Engineering’) carried out a second inspection [EvB 50-56]. It made\nthe following observations:\n“Cladding System\nThe weathering performance of the building envelope relies entirely on the\nsilicone seal applied to the aluminium pressure caps. Secondary seals were\nnot identified.\nThe cladding system consists of a hardwood timber sub frame clad with\nglass and aluminium. Timber can be used for cladding systems, if adequately\nprotected against moisture and other factors that can cause deterioration\nand most significantly movement, which can lead to water penetration.\nHowever, in this case the external line of defence is ineffective and needs\nreplacing.\nThe examination of the timber framing and its fixings was limited to a small\narea. The structural principle of this cladding system could therefore not be\nentirely investigated. Further investigation would be required to understand\nhow the timber framing is attached to the main structure and how structural\ntolerances and building movements are dealt with…\n…\nRecommendations\n….\nThe curtain wall system is very basic. However, the timber and metal work\nis in better condition than anticipated. A calculation check is required on the\nstructural ability of the timber to resist the required wind loads and dead\nloads. If appropriate, two options exist:\n- to replace the curtain wall in entirety with a new modern system\n- to adapt the existing arrangement to improve its performance and\ndurability.\n14\n\nIf the second option were preferred, further investigation is required to\nassess its viability and the level of performance that could be achieved. The\noption must involve:\n- Creating a new, reliable water-excluding cladding line in front of the\ntimber, but perhaps recruiting a contribution to the stiffness from the\ntimber framing. It must address movement in the timber.\n- Upgrading the insulation\n- Installing stiffer framed windows with restricted opening dimension\n- Prototypes would be required.”\n46. It is not clear what further investigatory work was undertaken as a result of\nArup’s second inspection. A letter of 23 March 2007 [EvB 57] indicates that\nthey remained in discussions with Targetfollow over what was to be done. A\nmuch lesser scope of works appeared to be anticipated, including revision of\nthe hardwood framing, but again Arup confirmed that “a prototype to confirm\nfeasibility” was required. There was also talk of reinforcement of the joints\nbetween mullions and transoms by inserting stainless steel plates and fixings\nand adding double-glazed units.\n47. In December 2007, Ramboll WhitbyBird reported for Cox Project\nManagement regarding the curtain wall refurbishment [EvB 62 – 128]. It is\nclear from the following passage that by that point, Targetfollow had\ninstructed that it was not going to be doing the remedial work necessary to\ncure the issues in the façade once and for all, on the basis that they had other\nplans:\n“1.3 The works are required by the client to have a service life of 7 years but\nno more than 10 years in anticipation of either more permanent\nrefurbishment works, or demolition of the building as part of a wider site\nredevelopment. However, the works are to satisfy the planning authorities\nconcerned with the heritage value of the Listed Building, in correspondence\nexclusively with the architect.”\n48. Ramboll WhitbyBird appear to have had a number of reservations about what\nit was being instructed to do by virtue of what it viewed as the unsatisfactory\nevidence of the underlying problems, as can be seen for example in 2.7, 2.15,\nand most particularly 2.19 – 2.25 where it set out that the approach being\ntaken in the works was, in its view, a low-cost high-risk approach, and the cost\nsavings illusory if the frames turned out to be rotten. No doubt that is why\nRamboll WhitbyBird noted at paragraph 2.4 that “[t]his report is not to be\nrelied upon exclusively by the client for decision making purposes since the\nclient has already relied upon a number of considered reports from Ove Arup\n& Partners… which appear to date from 1999”, and at 2.22 “[a] full\nreplacement rather than a refurbishment is clearly the most risk-free\napproach for the project manager to recommend, but this has been rejected\nby the client.”\n49. In July 2008, Independent Building Investigation Services (‘IBIS’) reported\non the external glazing systems at CPH [EvB 129 – 144]. The main façades\nwere found to be in generally poor condition. IBIS provided a long list of\n15\n\nissues, including warping and outwards movement of the aluminium press-on\nplates, broken glazing panels, poor fitting of some windows,\nlost/sheared/broken window armature and hinges, exposure of the wooden\nsub-frame and evidence of rot, inappropriate fixings piercing aluminium\nframes, hardened cracked and failed mastic and poor repairs to it, evidence of\ndamp ingress at many locations, and removal of aluminium frame sections for\nwire installation through glazing, leaving the sub-timber exposed to the\nelements. IBIS concluded:\n“The main façades’ [sic] glazing system is essentially in need of a major\noverhaul as the seals have long passed the point where they should have been\nreplaced. Repairs to date have been reactive, haphazard and generally very\npoor, and ultimately ineffective. Given the many other issues identified, it is\nprobable that complete replacement of the glazing system is the most viable\nlong-term solution.”\n50. A tender report was prepared by Cox Project Management on 30 March 2009\n[EvB 146 – 196]. On 11 June 2009, Jones Lang LeSalle notified the residents\nof a presentation about the proposed refurbishment of the exterior of CPH\n[EvB 145]. At that meeting on 30 June 2009 [EvB 59], the leaseholders\nwere informed that, so far as the façade was concerned, it was proposed that\nthe timber sub-frames be ‘hammer tested’ (a process by which an operative,\nunder the supervision of a supervisor, would strike the frame from the inside\nusing a rubber hammer on a block of wood, and assess the visible movement\nof the frame. It was suggested that the more observable movement in the\nframe, the more likely the frame or fixings were water damaged [EvB 66\npara 3.2.1]). Any large top-opening window-lights that were deemed by this\ntest to be unsafe would be replaced and decorated, and the existing “steel”\ncurtain walling would be redecorated. Existing windows might be eased and\nadjusted if necessary.\n51. A 1985 Act section 20 Notice of Estimates was sent to leaseholders under\ncover of letter dated 25 September 2009 (a previous one of 3 December 2008\nseemingly having been withdrawn at the leaseholders’ request) [EvB 200 –\n272]. Insofar as the works to the façade were concerned, the work was said to\nbe for “[t]he replacement of large size external opening windows, where\ndamaged, with new single glazed units. There will also be an element of\ninternal reinstatement works following water ingress. Timber frames where\nrotten will also be cut out and replaced with hardwood frames.” It was\nproposed that Bryen Langley be appointed as Targetfollow’s contractors.\n52. While there are updates that were provided by Bryen Langley (to the\nleaseholders by way of ‘weekly newsletters’ [EvB 273], and progress reports\nto Targetfollow [EvB 274-276 and 283 - 289]), and a completion certificate\ndated 27 August 2010 limiting any defects claim to one year [EvB 290], the\nApplicants have been unable to find any record of what was in fact carried out\nin the course of these works prior before Almacantar’s acquisition of the\nCentre Point estate. We are told that the works in total, including works to the\nmosaic tiling and balconies, eventually cost each flat in the region of £30,000.\n16\n\n53. Targetfollow finally achieved 100% commercial occupation in the Tower, but\nappears to have overreached itself with its investments strategy, and in April\n2011 Almacantar (Centre Point) Limited (‘Almacantar’) bought Targetfollow\n(and its sole remaining asset, the Centre Point estate) out of receivership for in\nthe region of £120 million. In the course of that acquisition, on 11 February\n2011 Almacantar obtained a fenestration survey report from Tee Technical\nBuilding Forensics (‘Tee Technical’) [EvB 291 – 324].\n54. It would appear that Tee Technical had no more than visual access, at a\ndistance, to the exterior of CPH when providing its report. It misidentified the\nwindows in the façade as being made from aluminium, rather than a\nhardwood sub-structure onto which aluminium pressure-plates were fixed,\nand further misidentified the spandrel panels as being made from “coated\nsheet aluminium”. Despite a number of similar inaccuracies in the report\n(some no doubt arising because of the limited access), Tee Technical\nnevertheless identified that “the various fenestration systems date[d] back to\nthe original construction and [had] nominally reached the end of their design\nlife”, and that “the aluminium framed window systems to the residential\naccommodation… [were] visually in a poor condition with widespread ad-\nhoc poorly applied external sealants and a consequent moderate risk of\ninternal rainwater ingress and/or condensation problems.”\n55. Pell Frischmann also provided a structural appraisal report to Almacantar on\n15 February 2011. However, it did not inspect anything but the concrete\nelements. It recorded that because of the covering of the whole of the CPH\nstructure by mosaic tile, visual inspection was limited, but that it did not\nidentify any evidence of significant structural defects [EvB 334].\n56. Malcolm Hollis LLP also provided a Building Survey report on 17 February\n2011 [EvB 344 – 432]. It was not given access to flats in CPH to carry out its\nsurvey, although it did have access to the common areas. In its summary [EvB\n346] it noted that “[t]he podium residential areas of Centre Point House…\nare in worse condition. Regular maintenance will be necessary going\nforward, as has been carried out recently with new casement windows being\ninstalled. Condensation is a problem throughout the block and this will not\nbe rectified until the current installation is replaced with a modern\nequivalent. Due to the regular work required to keep the cladding system\nperforming adequately, we consider the current installation is becoming\nobsolete.” Malcolm Hollis otherwise deferred to the report of Tee Technical\n[EvB 355 at 2.5.1].\n57. Almacantar then embarked on a grand scheme of renewal, renovation, and\nredevelopment of the Centre Point estate. Planning permissions were sought\nand obtained, as was listed building consent, for a particular scheme that\nincluded improvement to the external envelope of CPH (including its\nbalconies) (‘the Consented Scheme’). The Tower was converted from\ncommercial to residential occupation. That was not without its difficulties\n(see, for example, Century Projects Limited v Almacantar (Centre Point)\nLimited & Ors [2014] EWHC 394 (Ch)). The link building became something\nakin to a restaurant village. However, there was a very particular difficulty\nposed by CPH, given the terms of the residential leases, which demise the\n17\n\nbalconies, and the internal parts of the window frames and glass, to the\nlessees.\n58. On 19 March 2012, Almacantar wrote to the residential lessees [EvB 441-\n442], the material terms of which were are follows:\n“…Given that we have greater control over the complex than at any time\nsince its construction, there is not an opportunity to substantially upgrade\nthe complex as a whole to our collective benefit…\nWith regard to [CPH], our plans are rather more modest in that we wish to\nreconfigure the lower level commercial areas to provide two storey, double\nheight retail units throughout. We also consider it would be beneficial to\nrefresh the exterior façade and to renew the fenestration (i.e. the windows)\nof each elevation of CPH at the same time…\nTo undertake the Scheme, Almacantar require the consent of residential\ntenants, which would necessitate agreement to:\na) A Deed of Variation of each flat lease to make future responsibility for\nthe repair of windows the responsibility of the Landlord, as a service\ncharge matter;\nb) A general waiver of any claims in nuisance and for any impairment of\nthe Quiet Enjoyment clause in each lease for the duration of the\nworks;\nc) Acceptance of the Party Wall notices that will be necessary to serve on\nthe bottom floor residential flats;\nd) Agreement not to object to Almacantar’s planning application.\nWe believe that our proposals will result in a vastly improved asset for all the\nowners. In return for granting the above, if the Scheme is commenced,\nAlmacantar is prepared to offer each tenant the following inducements:\na) Almacantar will bear the legal costs of each tenant provided they\nappoint a single legal firm to act in connection with the variation of\nthe leases and collectively appoint no more than two residents’\nrepresentatives to act on their behalf with the authority to negotiate\nthe detail of the terms set out herein and to ensure smooth progress of\nthe legal formalities;\nb) At no cost to the tenants, Almacantar will:\n• Replace the communal ground floor entrance doors and\nelectrical security access arrangements and all existing\nexternal windows to all facades with new double-glazed units\nto a design and specification to the satisfaction of the relevant\nstatutory authorities and in keeping with the existing window\ndesign, together with localised making good and redecoration\nas necessary to window reveals and rejambs*;\n• Because the kitchen worktops in each flat dovetail into the cill of\neach relevant window, Almacantar will also contribute\n£10,000 plus VAT toward a new kitchen for each tenant to\nacquire and install;\n18\n\n• Rectify the continuing water ponding and drainage issues\nexperienced with all balconies*;\n• Undertake redecoration, lighting and re-carpeting of the\ncommunal corridors and redecoration of the stairways*;\n• Bear the cost for cleaning and repairing all of the external\nelevations of CPH as necessary*;\n• Provide a durable solution to the on-going de-bonding of the\nexternal mosaic tiles to the satisfaction of the relevant statutory\nauthorities*; and\nc) In consideration of the waiver of Quiet Enjoyment for the duration of\nthe works (estimated to be 6 months), Almacantar will make an\nadditional payment to each flat owner, irrespective of whether they\nchoose to actually vacate, of £12,500.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if we do not get approval from the tenants, those\ncosts listed above marked by an asterisk will be borne by Almacantar on a\none-off basis. From the completion of the works, future repair of these items\nwill return to being a service charge matter. We believe that these works,\ncombined with our proposals for the rest of the complex will significantly\nenhance the value of each individual flat…\n…\n[A meeting was convened for 12 April 2011 from 4.30pm, with Almacantar\nrepresentatives available at from 6.30pm] In order to facilitate the residents’\nconsideration of this proposal, Almacantar are also willing to bear the\nreasonable costs of a surveyor and a solicitor to advise the residents in\npreparing for and attending this meeting, up to a cap of £5,000 + VAT.\n…\nWe trust you will recognise the very substantial contribution Almacantar is\nprepared to make to what otherwise would be tenants’ costs to secure\nagreement to undertake these works for our collective benefit.\nIf we do not secure agreement to the above offer from tenants by 25 April\n2012, we will revert to our base proposal of a more modest refurbishment of\nthe lower floor commercial areas without removing the floor slabs and will\nproceed only with the general exterior works to Centre Point House\n(cleaning, fissure repair and tiling rectification) and the upgrade of the\ncommunal areas internally. In this situation, since these works are service\ncharge items, Almacantar will seek a fair proportion of these costs from each\ntenant in the normal way. We anticipate that the eventual cost to the service\ncharge account in this scenario will total approximately £600,000 plus VAT\n(i.e. £16,666 plus VAT per flat).”\n59. On 12 April 2012, a residents meeting went ahead. The minutes of the meeting\nseem to reflect positive attitudes to the offer at the outset but doubts by the\nend of it. The residents asked a good deal of relevant questions about the\nscheme and what was proposed. The need for a deed of variation appears to\nhave been explained, as was the calculation behind the £12,500 offer.\nInvitations to the public planning meetings to be held on 21 and 23 April 2011\nwere extended. It appears that Almacantar explained that the future service\n19\n\ncharge would be reduced if the works went ahead. The leaseholders were told\nthat Almacantar would need unanimous agreement to the offer for the CPH\npart of the Consented Scheme to go ahead [EvB 443 – 445].\n60. On 3 and 8 May 2012, Almacantar wrote to the leaseholders to identify that it\nintended to proceed with a more modest scheme of works to the lower-level\ncommercial units at CPH [EvB 446 – 452], per the Consented Scheme, that\nwould nevertheless involve slab-cutting works. It notified that, in\nconsequence, there would be a minimum of 8 months’ work to completion,\nand it was likely to be disruptive to the occupiers. Works in the rest of the\nestate were anticipated to take in the region of 30 months. It therefore sought\nthe leaseholders’ consent in similar terms to those that had been set out in its\n19 March 2012 letter, but set out the works and requirements, and the\nproposals in more substantial detail. It increased the offer in c) of the previous\nletter to £16,650 plus VAT, with an overrun daily rate payment of £68.50 plus\nVAT. It also proposed further assistance in storage for valuable items during\nthe proposed period of vacation of the flats, and a number of other security\nmeasures. It reiterated that if the proposal was not unanimously accepted, the\nlower floor renovations would go ahead without removing the floor slabs, and\nonly general works to CPH would be done at a cost to the leaseholders via the\nservice charge.\n61. It appears that there were subsequent meetings, either with all the\nleaseholders or with their then-representatives Mr Michael Woolf and Ms\nDeValk. A letter proposing “revised enhanced terms” was sent to Mr Woolf on\n24 July 2012 [EvB 462 – 467]. In it, Almacantar identified that:\n“Almacantar consider it would be beneficial at the same time [as the wider\nestate works and commercial units works at the base of CPH] to refresh the\nexterior façade and to renew the fenestration (i.e. the windows and patio\ndoors) of each elevation of CPH. As we have discussed, the windows (and\nbalconies) are excluded from the landlord’s repairing obligations under the\nservice charge of the leases with the consequence that over time, the\nfenestration has become unsightly, being a patchwork of various states of\ndisrepair with the landlord having no effective ability to procure its repair,\nmaintenance and renewal. As the residents are all too aware, the\nfenestration itself (i.e. the windows and patio doors) is now not fit for\npurpose, falling well short of modern statutory thermal and acoustic\nperformance requirements and indeed acts as a cold bridge affording the\ningress of water through condensation and causing spoiling of the localised\ninternal decoration.”\n62. By that letter, Almacantar once again increased its offer. For the slab-cutting\nphase of the works, whether or not the leaseholders chose to decant for the 8-\nmonth period, it offered £20,000 plus VAT, and an overrun daily rate of\n£81.00 plus VAT per flat. Further assurances were made regarding working\nhours, warranties and so forth. The leaseholders were again told that the\ncommercial works would continue without cutting the floor slabs if agreement\nwas not reached, and the lesser works to CPH would be service charge items.\n20\n\n63. By letter of 2 August 2012 [EvB 469] Almacantar wrote to all leaseholders\n“following conclusion of negotiations with Mr Woolf who has now requested\nwe write to each individual flat owner enclosing various copy\ncorrespondence”. The implication of the letter is that the leaseholders had not\nbeen able to achieve unanimity as required, and that Mr Woolf sought\nintercession by Almacantar to assist in what must have been a difficult role.\n64. Email correspondence from Mr Woolf of 6 August 2012 [EvB 471]\ndemonstrates that Mr Savage remained un-swayed by Almacantar’s offer.\n65. In is not clear what happened thereafter between Almacantar and the\nleaseholders, but throughout 2013, Almacantar continued to develop its plans\nfor a proposed new curtain walling system for CPH, and it appears that at least\ntwo leaseholders objected to the planning application for it ([EvB 479] and\n[EvB 628]) on the basis that Almacantar was not entitled to do the works. A\ntender specification was prepared, and at least one tender submitted, for a\nreplacement façade using a Schüco system [Ev 480 – 606].\n66. In September 2013, Almacantar transferred its interest to the Applicants,\nthough Almacantar Group Limited continues to have the controlling interest\nin respect of both, and each is a dormant company on Companies House\nrecords.\n67. It appears from advice from Gately Legal disclosed by the leaseholders that\nthere was a further offer in at least October 2013. Advice in general terms\nappears to have been given on the practical consequences of the refusal of the\noffer (it was suggested that injunctions could be sought), but no particular\nfocus on the Applicants’ repairing covenants, or the benefits or otherwise of\nacceptance of the proposal, appears in that advice [EvB 607-608].\n68. Planning permission for the development of the estate, including the\nConsented Scheme at CPH, was granted on 1 April 2014 subject to a section\n106 Town and Country Planning Act 1990 agreement. There were also certain\nconditions that needed to be first fulfilled, the material ones for CPH being\nthose relating to the heritage/listing status. As might be expected, the consent\nwas also conditional on detailed plans being approved before the relevant part\nof the work was begun [EvB 610 – 626].\n69. It appears that the wider estate works, including the works to the commercial\nspace beneath CPH, commenced sometime in 2015. There were a number of\nregrettable incidents throughout the duration of those works that significantly\naffected the leaseholders and further undermined their relationship with the\nApplicants (we are told, for example, that statutory working hours were not\nadhered to, there was at least one significant health and safety incident with a\nresident, and that despite the contents of the letters above, the slabs beneath\nCPH were in fact cut in the course of the works to the commercial areas,\ncausing significant disturbance). The leaseholders and Applicants engaged\nparty wall surveyors to monitor movement. The London Borough of Camden\nput in noise monitoring equipment. Various issues that arose are recorded in\n[EvB 657-663].\n21\n\n70. The leaseholders called on the assistance of their local councillor, Mrs Sue\nVincent, to assist in resolving the issues between them and the Applicants. We\nwere told that payments were made for breach of quiet enjoyment, and that a\nhotel conference room was arranged for daytime respite. During the course of\nthat assistance, it would appear (and Mr Catto confirmed that it was probably\ncorrect) that the leaseholders asked Mrs Vincent to reopen the discussions\nregarding the 2011 Consented Scheme. A meeting was held on 9 November\n2015, which prompted a letter from Almacantar setting out its view of the\nhistory of the dispute between the leaseholders, revealing that all leaseholders\nexcept Mr Savage had in fact accepted their previous offer [EvB 634 – 637].\nIn that letter, the Applicants set out as follows:\n“As you will be aware, Centre Point is now circa 50 years old. It and its\ninfrastructure are in need of thorough refurbishment or replacement. The\nresidents’ leases are typically of 125-year duration and reserve to the\nlandlord the rights to undertake exactly the nature of works we are now\ndoing. It is wholly reasonable for us to expect that, in accepting such rights,\nthe residents expect that at sometime such works have to be undertaken.\n…\nNotwithstanding our position set out above and in BLP’s [as they then were]\nletter to the residents’ lawyer, Gateley Plc, dated 31 July 2015, the ongoing\nsituation is unsatisfactory and we would like to find a swift and amicable\nresolution. Following recent events, I have spent some significant time\nconsidering the way forward.\nGiven the procurement timetable and the ever shortening period to complete\nour other works we had resolved that it was simply not possible to revisit\nanother re-fenestration proposal along the lines tabled in October 2014.\nHowever, upon further reflection and with some considerable amendments\nto out plans, we would be willing to consider how we could now\naccommodate this. I should point out that it is incredibly late in the\nprogramme and as a result the already significant costs for these works have\nnot only increased further but are very difficult to incorporate at this stage. I\nneed to stress that there is a very small window for the works to be\nincorporated at this time and it requires that all residents agree to this offer\nwithout further delay.\nAccordingly, we shall be informing the residents that provided they all agree\nin very short order and no later than 15 December 2015 to give us unfettered\naccess, we would reconsider undertaking the refenestration works and, as\npart of that, offering each resident an ex gratia payment of £25,000.”\n71. A revised offer was made. A meeting was to be held with the leaseholders on 11\nJanuary 2016. Prior to that meeting, Mr Savage informed Mrs Vincent (and\nshe in turn communicated it to the Applicants, to whom she expressed her\nregret at Mr Savage’s decision to ignore his fellow leaseholders, and their own\ndisappointment) as follows:\n22\n\n“So that you have my reply before the meeting on Monday, I will be asking\nfor a minimum payment of £100,000 per flat (six) plus all costs associated\nwith relocating all of my tenants for the duration of the works. I will also\nrequire at least three months [sic] notice per flat before works begin on each\nproperty.”\n72. Almacantar continued to attempt to pursue the offer at least until July 2016,\nand prepared a deed of settlement [EvB 655 – 679]. At the hearing, the\nleaseholders criticised the Applicants for not convincing Mr Savage, or not\nnegotiating better, or for not accepting the offer that some of their individual\nsums of £25,000 be offered to Mr Savage instead. As we observed at the\nhearing, even had every other flat forfeited their £25,000 in Mr Savage’s\nfavour, they would still have been £100,000 short of the minimum sum\ndemanded by Mr Savage (before taking into account additional relocation\ncosts of his tenants etc). A ‘ransom’ sum is indeed an appropriate description\nof it.\n73. The negotiations having finally and irrecoverably failed, there continued to be\nreports of water ingress into the façade [EvB 687 – 690]. The Applicants\nthen sought professional advice from Dr Harris, a partner of Sandberg LLP,\nand façade specialist [EvB 680 – 686], who we understand was involved in\nthe Tower works prior to this. He was instructed by them that the Applicants’\npreferred way forward was a re-fenestration project. They identified that the\nfaçade was not performing as it should, there being leaks and condensation\noccurring. Dr Harris’s instructions were set out at paragraph 5:\n“5.1 You are instructed to advise on the issues set out below:\n5.2 Are any of the following parts of the residential apartments in the\nProperty in disrepair:\n(a) the exterior surfaces of the windows,\n(b) the exterior surfaces of the door frames,\n(c) the exterior surfaces of the doors, and\n(d) the structural parts of the balconies?\n5.3 If so, what remedial works can be carried out to remedy disrepair in\nthose parts?\n5.4 What are the costs of the remedial option(s)?\n5.5 What are the pros/cons to the remedial options?\n5.6 Is the Client’s proposed solution of the Fenestration Works a reasonable\noption for remedying the disrepair?”\n74. In the hearing, the leaseholders made criticism that part of the instruction\nletter to Dr Harris was redacted. The part that is redacted is in the section\n23\n\n‘Legal Issues’. At the end of it, in the unredacted part, the instruction letter\nstates: “For the avoidance of doubt, we are not asking you to comment on\n[the] legal position or the interpretation of the lease. We are just setting out\nour position by way of background, so that you understand the context of the\nexpert advice sought.” It is plain from those contents that what was set out\nwas what the Applicants were being advised by BCLP regarding the respective\nrights under the lease as regards repair/renewal/improvement and good and\nsubstantial repair/equal standard that remained, until the PTR in November\n2023, in issue between the parties. The fact that the legal advice was redacted\nbecause it was privileged was explained to the leaseholders in an email of 22\nJuly 2021 [EvB 1431]. It is not a surprise to the Tribunal that those parts\nwere therefore redacted while the issue remained live, though we understand\nthat the leaseholders consider that means that the Applicants were hiding\nsomething, which built on the mistrust between them. We are satisfied that\nthe instructions make clear to the expert that his only job was to use his\nexpertise to identify what if anything was wrong with the identified areas, and\nwhat might be done about it. Legal issues were never a matter for him (or any\nexpert) to opine on, but were in the sole purview of the lawyers.\n75. The leaseholders also suggested that this letter shows that the Applicants had\nalready made up their mind and would not consider any other reasonable\noptions. We are satisfied that the letter specifically asks Dr Harris to consider\nall remedial options, even if the Applicants’ preference is indicated.\n76. By report dated 4 August 2017 ([ExB 928 - 996], hereafter ‘the first\nSandberg report’), Dr Harris advised that the windows in the east and west\nelevations of CPH were found to be degrading and rotting, which was being\nhidden by the aluminium face-plates. Joints were showing evidence of failure,\nand a limited opening-up exercise revealed that one frame profile was no\nlonger firmly secured at either end, such that it moved when touched. He\nconsidered that the windows were life-expired and needed replacement within\nthe next 12-24 months. He suggested (his emphasis):\n“If action is taken now, before rot is able to extend deeper into the frames,\nthen the structural element of the timber frames can likely be saved, and the\nwindows converted to a high performance drained double glazing system by\nmeans of plant-on frame profiles fitted onto the existing timber frames\nexternally. This will significantly reduce disruption to the building\noccupants, since the bulk of the works can be carried out working from\noutside the building and there will be little or no disruption to internal\nfinishes. If the rot is allowed to continue then wholesale replacement of the\ntimber frames is inevitable, and will likely require the apartments to be\nemptied whilst this is done.”\n77. Dr Harris set out his concerns in respect of the façade [ExB 949]:\n“7.4 Condition of Primary Facade Windows\n7.4.1 The windows are timber framed, with single glazing (toughened\nspandrel panels, annealed vision glass) and screw-fixed aluminium\npressure plates externally to retain the glazing.\n24\n\n7.4.2 A number of frame joints have failed, in that they are no longer\ntight and sealed, and in a limited random inspection one frame was\nfound to move under light pressure once the pressure plate had been\nremoved.\n7.4.3 The timber frames to the windows are rotting internally, as\nwould be expected for window frames of this age. It is impossible to\nsay what the overall extent of the rot is, but it is clear that if rot has\ncommenced in some locations, it is quite likely occurring elsewhere:\ntwo out of four locations picked at random (from the available vacant\napartments) were found to be rotting (the other two locations were\nfound to have damp inside the glazing rebate, which indicates that the\nmechanism for rot is present, and some degradation of the timber has\nlikely already occurred).\n7.4.4 The structural integrity of the windows is therefore uncertain.\nAny degradation of the nosing of the frames will reduce the pull-out\nstrength of the pressure plate fixing screws, and the worst case is that\na pane of glazing could be sucked out of the facade in high winds. If\nthe frames are allowed to continue to degrade in this way then an\naccident is inevitable:\n7.4.4.1 Based on our inspection we are of the opinion that\nreplacement works should be undertaken within the next one to\ntwo years (allowing time for Building Regulations approval to\nbe obtained).\n7.4.5 Based on our observations we believe that the rot has not yet\nprogressed to the point where the timber frames need to be replaced\nwholesale:\n7.4.5.1 The primary structural element of the timber frames\ncould be retained, with the rotting nosing cut away, and a\nplant-on profile added externally. It should be possible to\nobtain a warranty for the new window elements, although this\nwould exclude the retained timber frames.\n7.4.6 These works could be carried out externally, most likely working\nfrom a scaffold, and would involve minimal disruption inside the\napartments.\n7.4.7 In terms of cost, removal and replacement of existing windows\ncan easily cost £1,000 per square metre or even more, and to obtain\nreliable costings would require the support of a suitable glazing\ncontractor. Based on an estimated area of 1,200 m2 for the two main\nelevations (excluding the balcony door screens) this would indicate\ncosts of the order of £1.2m.”\n78. In conclusion, Dr Harris summed up his recommended actions as follows\n[ExB 950]:\n“7.5 Temporary Repairs\n25\n\n7.5.1 We would not recommend any attempt at wholesale re-sealing of\nthe windows externally: as described above any such re-sealing would\nbe expected to fail within the first year after application, and would\nsimply be throwing money away. However, localised resealing could\nbe used to address any areas where significant leaks into the building\nare occurring, but this should not be regarded as a long term solution.\n7.5.2 Any attempt at repairing the rotting timber locally would\nrequire 100% removal of the pressure plates and glazing, with the risk\nof consequential damage. The access required for such an approach\n(scaffolding) would be a major cost element. It is quite possible that all\nof the pressure plates will be damaged beyond the point of re-use, and\nthere will likely also be some considerable degree of glass breakage.\nThe resulting repaired windows would essentially be the same low-\nperformance system that is there at present. In any event, the cost of\nsuch repairs would be prohibitive and unreasonable.\n7.6 Alternative Remedial Works\n7.6.1 We have considered various options but have not identified any\nviable alternatives for remedial works that do not involve\nreplacement of the entire glazing system or are not a variant of the\nplant-on glazing approach. Plant-on framing profiles are available\nfrom several suppliers, and are an accepted means of applying\nmodern thermally-broken drained glazing systems onto any form of\nsupporting structure.\n7.7 We re-iterate our concern that if these works are not carried out within\nthe next one or two years then there is an increasing risk that a pane of glass\ncould be sucked out of the facade. Although regular inspections of the facade\nshould indicate when a pressure plate is started to become detached (it will\nlikely unzip from one end), this would then necessitate immediate action to\nre-fix the pressure plate, and the fact that the pressure plate is coming away\nis an indicator that the timber frame is rotting to the point that wholesale\nreplacement is likely to be necessary.\n79. A copy of the first Sandberg report was sent to leaseholders under cover of a\nletter dated 5 October 2017 [EvB 696], notifying that a 1985 Act consultation\nwould be progressed in due course. On 10 October 2017, Rick Mather\nArchitects (now rebranded as MICA) advised the Applicants on the\nconsequences in terms of differences between the plant on system and the\nConsented Scheme, and their likely fees/timescales [EvB 698]. Further\nactions were discussed regarding the approach to an updated planning\nconsent in a meeting between the Applicants, Gerald Eve, MICA, and HML\nHawksworth (the Applicants’ managing agents for CPH – hereafter ‘HML’) on\n8 February 2018 [EvB 754]. WT Partnership Limited (‘WTP’) were\napproached for appointment as the Applicants’ quantity surveyors [EvB 756]\nand MICA for appointment as the Applicants’ architects [EvB 757] in April\n2018. HML started making demands for reserve fund contributions to the\nfaçade replacement in June 2018 [EvB 759 – 762].\n26\n\n80. It appears that a meeting took place with the Applicants’ appointed team on 21\nSeptember 2018, at which MICA indicated that a report was required as to the\nstructural integrity of the timber sub-structure at CPH to support the plant on\nscheme proposed by Dr Harris. Dr Harris was therefore instructed to carry out\nthat report, by letter of instruction dated 20 November 2018 [EvB 763 –\n767]. An initial technical meeting was convened by MICA on 21 January 2019,\nat which MICA identified an alternative potential technical solution to the\nfaçade remediation by the installation of a Raico system, a form of over-\ncladding not unlike the Schüco system, but of a slimmer profile to the\nadvantage of the preservation of the protected facade [EvB 768]. WTP were\nformally appointed on 19 March 2019 [EvB 769].\n81. On 18 March 2019, a window fell out of its frame in flat 20. Fortunately, it fell\nonto the flat roof above the podium level rather than into the public square\nbelow. Falcon Building Maintenance (‘Falcon’) attended to check the\ncondition of the windows in the flats 3, 4, 6, 21, 25, 27, 32, 36 and 37, but were\nrefused entry to flat 6. The windows in the other flats were fixed closed due to\nFalcon’s assessment of their condition. The occupier of flat 4 refused\npermission for Falcon to do so [EvB 804]. Falcon commented as follows:\n“Previous windows we have viewed in Centre Point House had rotted\nsections of frames, and are coming to the end of their life span, and need\nreplacing. We also noted in the inspection of 26/3/19 that the window in Flat\n37 cannot be closed due to dropped hinges and the handles had broken where\nresidents had attempted to close it.\nWe have fixed closed the windows [as above] until they are replaced with\nnew as we consider the frames are in poor and unsafe condition, and if these\nfall there is a high risk of fatality in the street. We also recommend that\nbedroom windows in the other flats should be fixed shut until renewed.”\n82. On 23 March 2019, Eckersley O’Callaghan provided a Scope Inspection for\nIntrusive Investigation [EvB 957 – 964]. Opening-up works followed at flats\n36 and 37, identifying the metal straps tying back the timber frames to the\nconcrete structure [EvB 806].\n83. On 20 May 2019, Dr Harris wrote to the Applicants to recommend the\nscrewing shut of all the large opening lights, in consequence of the incident\nwith flat 20 and the unknown spread of rot within the timber system [EvB\n808]. This was a request communicated to leaseholders on a number of\nrepeat occasions over the following years, both in writing and at residents’\nmeetings (e.g. [EvB 810], [EvB 816], [EvB 820], [EvB 822],[EvB 965],\n[EvB 1291]). By 10 February 2020, leaseholders of 18 flats had either failed\nto or had only partly complied [EvB 1108]. We were informed at the hearing,\nalmost five years later, that Dr Harris believed that Mr Doran still had not\ncomplied.\n84. It seems that it was during this period that the previous reports from Arup,\nRamboll WhitbyBird, IBIS, Cox Project Management, and JonesLangLesalle\nwere made available to Dr Harris. It is a matter of contention when the\n27\n\nApplicants knew about those reports, which we will need to decide on another\noccasion if necessary. Leaving the other reports aside, at least so far as the\nArup reports are concerned Dr Harris’ recollection was that he approached\nArup for them, which is suggestive that they were not previously in the\nApplicants’ possession (and therefore it would seem the contents could not\nhave been in their knowledge). In any event, no-one suggests Dr Harris had\nthem or was aware of their contents prior to preparing his first report.\n85. In July 2019, Clearwater provided façade modelling for environmental\nperformance of a new façade [EvB 829 – 838], presumably on the basis of\nthe Raico system. On 13 June 2019 Eckersley O’Callaghan provided a\nCondensation Analysis of Balcony Interfaces [EvB 944 – 956], and on 26\nJuly 2019, a Façade Replacement Options Feasibility Study [EvB 880 - 904]\nand Preliminary Thermal Performance Report [EvB 905 – 943].\n86. In October 2019, Dr Harris identified a further remedial option, Option A*,\nbased on a like-for-like replacement of all the elements of the façade except for\nthe glazing to the door screens and balconies [ExB 997].\n87. It appears that in or around January or February 2020, the Applicants served\na 1985 Act section 20 Notice of Intention regarding the façade works on the\nleaseholders, but that the notice was withdrawn at the request of some\nleaseholders because the first covid lockdown was put in place and some of\nthem did not have access to their documents [EvB 1109].\n88. On 25 August 2020, Dr Harris provided his second report (‘the second\nSandberg report’) after further inspections he had undertaken on 29 April\n2019, 14 May 2019, October 2019 and March 2020 [ExB 999 – 1157]. As he\ntold us at the hearing, it was in the course of these further visits and in light of\nthe previous reports that his understanding of the façade was developed such\nthat it is now his belief that the façade was never capable or remediation by a\nplant on system, even at the date of the first Sandberg report. His conclusions\nwere as follows:\n11.4 Condition of Primary Facade Windows\n…\n11.4.2 A number of frame joints have failed, in that they are no longer\ntight and sealed, and in a limited random inspection one frame was\nfound to move under light pressure once the pressure plate had been\nremoved, indicating that the structural connection has already failed.\n11.4.3 The timber frames to the windows are rotting internally. This is\nnot unusual for undrained window frames of this age. It is impossible\nto say what the overall extent of the rot is. To establish the extent of\nthe rot now would entail a 100% opening-up exercise and some degree\nof destructive testing (drilling into the timber at intervals along the\nlength of a frame). Even a localised area of rot may be sufficient to\nweaken the frame to the point of failure, if it occurs at a location\n28\n\nwhere the frame is most heavily stressed (at the end joints or within\nthe central one-third of its length).\n11.4.4 It is clear that if rot has commenced in some locations, then it is\nquite likely occurring elsewhere: two out of four locations picked at\nrandom for opening-up works (from the available vacant apartments)\nwere found to be rotting. The other two locations were found to have\ndamp inside the glazing rebate, which indicates that the mechanism\nfor rot is present, and some degradation of the timber and loss of\nstructural strength has likely already occurred. Numerous other\nlocations have been identified, including some new locations identified\nduring the October 2019 inspection (see section 8 above), where there\nis visible evidence of decay, as well as mould growth and\ncondensation inside the flats, which indicates that another mechanism\nfor rot is also at work.\n11.4.5 The structural integrity of the windows is therefore uncertain.\nAny degradation of the nosing of the frames will reduce the pull-out\nstrength of the pressure plate fixing screws, and a pane of glazing\ncould be sucked out of the facade in high winds. Rotting of the lower\nhorizontal frame of the window sashes could lead to another sash\nfalling out of the facade, with potentially fatal consequences. If the\nframes are allowed to continue to degrade in this way then an\naccident is inevitable:\n11.4.5.1 Based on my inspection I am of the opinion that\nreplacement works should be undertaken as soon as possible\n(allowing time for the necessary Building Regulations approval\nto be obtained and for the consultation under Section 20 of the\nLandlord and Tenant act 1985 to be carried out with\nleaseholders).\n11.4.6 In terms of the best approach to remediation, I am strongly of\nthe opinion that patch repairs of the timber frames are not possible or\nappropriate for this kind of timber frame curtain walling system.\nMoreover the extent of repairs cannot be determined until a 100%\ninspection of the timber elements is carried out - the disruption that\nthis entails will inevitably lead to further damage, disruption and cost\nto the leaseholders.\n11.4.7 On that basis I am of the opinion that the safest, least disruptive\nand most cost-effective approach is to replace the outer parts of the\nglazing system with a more conventional curtain walling system,\nfixed back to the primary structure of the building at the floor slabs. I\nhave referred to this above as Option B.\n11.4.8 These works could all be carried out externally, most likely\nworking from a scaffold, and would involve minimal disruption inside\nthe apartments. In both cases I would propose that the timber frame is\nretained (although part of the nosing may be cut away to create more\nroom for the replacement frame elements). The timber frame would\n29\n\nremain as a purely decorative element, and would present no ongoing\nliability in terms of structural performance.\n11.5 Temporary Repairs\n11.5.1 I would not recommend any attempt at wholesale re-sealing of\nthe windows externally: as described above any such re-sealing would\nbe expected to fail within the first year after application, and would\nsimply be throwing money away. However, localised resealing could\nbe used as a temporary fix to address any areas where significant\nleaks into the building are occurring, but this should not be regarded\nas a long term solution, and any leaks addressed by this method will\ninevitably reoccur as the sealant fails.\n11.5.2 Any attempt at repairing the rotting timber locally would\nrequire 100% removal of the pressure plates and glazing, with the risk\nof consequential damage (the glazing tape has hardened and glass\nbreakage during removal is inevitable). The access required for such\nan approach (scaffolding) would be a major cost element. It is quite\npossible that the pressure plates will be damaged beyond the point of\nre-use, and there will likely also be some considerable risk of glass\nbreakage. The resulting repaired windows would essentially be the\nsame low-performance system that is there at present. In any event,\nthe cost of such repairs would be prohibitive and unreasonable.\n11.6 Alternative Remedial Works\n11.6.1 I have considered three options for replacement of the glazed\nfacade:\n11.6.1.1 Wholesale replacement of all elements of the facade, including\nthe timber frame, has been rejected on the grounds of the degree of\ndisruption that this would occur to the internal finishes to the flats,\nwhich would significantly increase the inconvenience and cost of the\nworks;\n11.6.1.2 Removal of the glass and external pressure plates and fixing of\na plant-on framing system onto the retained timber elements has been\nrejected because it is simply impossible to know the degree of rot and\nreserve of strength of the timber frame elements until either the works\nare undertaken or until a 100% intrusive (and possibly destructive)\nsurvey of the timber frames is carried out. Either of these approaches\nwill likely increase the overall cost and inconvenience of the\nreplacement;\n11.6.1.3 Fixing of a new intermediate structural framing element in\nfront of the existing timber frames (‘overglazing’) will eliminate the\nneed to remove the existing timber frames - the rotting areas will dry\nout and stabilise, and the removal of loads from the timber frames will\neliminate the risk of later failure. Retention of the timber elements will\n30\n\nretain the appearance of the facade when viewed from inside and will\nalso minimise disruption to the internal finishes.\n11.6.2 I have considered other options for repair or replacement of the\nglazing facade but have not identified any other alternatives for\nremedial works that do not involve replacement of the entire glazing\nsystem or are not a variant of the approaches that have been outlined\nabove.\n11.6.3 I re-iterate my concern that if these works are not carried out at\nthe earliest possible opportunity then there is an increasing risk that a\npane of glass could be sucked out of the facade, or that another\nwindow sash could fall out, possibly with fatal consequences:\n11.6.3.1 The failure of a window sash in April 2019 has already\nnecessitated remedial works to reduce the risk of another sash\nbecoming detached from the building elevations. At the date of this\nreport these remedial works had been satisfactorily carried out to at\nleast ten apartments, and were ongoing in the remainder. Once\ncompleted, these remedial works will substantially reduce the risk of\nanother sash falling from the building.\n89. At some point prior to the re-issued 1985 Act section 20 Notice of Intent, the\nleaseholders were provided with a document pack containing the second\nSandberg report, a letter from Dr Harris approving delaying the works until\n2022 [EvB 1123], an initial costs estimate for the façade works from WTP\ndated 5 May 2020 (inclusive of professional fees and VAT, in the sum of\n£5,971,260 [EvB 1111], making clear that the figures might change once\nquotes were obtained), and the MICA Scope of Works document [EvB 1125].\nIt is apparent that at around the same time, new demands were made towards\nthe reserves for considerably higher sums of money, which precipitated\nvarious reactions from the leaseholders, most of whom indicated that they\nwere viscerally opposed to paying [EvB 1126 – 1157]. As we understand it, to\ndate approximately £6,762,860 has been demanded from leaseholders for the\nProposed Scheme and the QLTA (roughly £260,000 per flat). £1,382,860 has\nbeen paid, which equates to roughly 5.4 leaseholders having paid in full (we\nare told that Ms DeValk, Mr Catto and Mr Negyal, and Mrs Woolf are amongst\nthose who have either paid in full, or overpaid, on their sums). That leaves\nover 19 flats in respect of which either nothing has been paid or full payment\nhas not been made. The outstanding sums are approximately £5,380,000.\n90. In around December 2020, the leaseholders (it is not clear which, save for Mr\nCatto) commissioned advice from a dilapidations surveyor at Tuffin Ferlby\nTaylor LLP [EvB 1158 – 1169].\n91. In January 2021, CBRE valued the flats in their current condition (with the\nworks pending) in the region of £640,000 - £680,000, with £1,140,000 being\nachievable after carrying out of the Proposed Scheme [EvB 1248 – 1260].\n92. On 20 January 2021 Dr Harris wrote to the leaseholders, at the Applicants’\ninvitation, to clarify the difference in indicative costs of a plant on system\n31\n\n(£1.2m) versus the estimated costs of the Proposed Scheme (nearly £6m)\n(which was explained by reference to the cost of the systems themselves,\nversus the costs of the systems plus all the other necessary parts of a scheme\nto install it e.g. labour, the latter of which he had not addressed in his first\nreport), and to address allegations that vibrations from works to the wider\nestate had caused or exacerbated the problems with the façade at CPH (in\nsummary, there was no evidence to support that contention) [EvB 1261 –\n1264]. On 21 January 2021, BCLP wrote in response to queries raised by\nleaseholders, which letter set out within it sums expended on the professional\nteam by that date [EvB 1273 – 1280]. The leaseholders set out their various\nresponses [EvB 1283 – 1290]. Essentially, the leaseholders’ position was\nthat the Applicants were not entitled to undertake the Proposed Scheme, on\ngrounds that the windows (save for their exterior) were demised to them. Mr\nHans Patel suggested that the only resort seemed to be to the Tribunal. This\ndid not appear to be agreed by other leaseholders.\n93. In April 2021, Dr Harris provided a note on the condition of the window and\nsash that fell out on 15 March 2019, with photographs and his observations,\nsupporting his call for action to fix the large window lights shut [EvB 1295 –\n1312]. On 27 April 2021, he provided answers to a number of questions put to\nhim by the leaseholders’ former expert [EvB 1313 – 1319]. Those were sent\nto the leaseholders under cover of letter of 28 April 2021, together with the\nminutes of the meeting between the technical team that had taken place on 22\nMarch 2019 and the letter of instruction to Dr Harris [EvB 1320].\n94. On 17 May 2021, Eckersley O’Callaghan provided a fourth revised Façade\nPerformance Specification for tender [EvB 1321 - 1366], specifying a stick\ncurtain wall system. On 24 May 2021, Astute Fire provided a Summary of the\nExternal Wall Performance Review [EvB 1367 - 1383], to provide fire safety\nadvice for the Proposed Scheme. In July 2021, MICA provided a revised\n(version 5) Scope of Work for the Proposed Scheme [EvB 1411 – 1424].\n95. A further residents meeting was held on 15 July 2021, at which the\nleaseholders were informed that the section 20 consultation process was about\nto recommence [EvB 1426 – 1427], and 1985 Act section 20 Notices of\nIntention for the Proposed Scheme and QLTA were given on 17 August 2021\n[EvB 1439 – 1448].\n96. The leaseholders’ then position may be summarised by reference to a response\nfrom Mr Catto, dated 15 September 2021 [EvB 1462 – 1464]. In it he set out\nthat he did not believe that the Applicants had the right to carry out the works,\non grounds that (i) there was no evidence of disrepair; (ii) the Proposed\nScheme was improvement not repair; (iii) the façade was capable of repair;\nand (iv) the Proposed Scheme amounted to works outside his contemplation\nat the date he entered into his lease, the amounts concerned were\nunreasonable, and the costs should therefore be borne by the Applicants. He\nalso disputed that it would be necessary to move out for a period of 8-9\nmonths whilst any such works were undertaken. Therefore, it was his view\nthat there was no right to recover service charges. Mr Catto required various\nevidence if the Proposed Scheme was not to be abandoned.\n32\n\n97. At a residents’ meeting on 14 October 2021 [EvB 1465 - 1471] the\nleaseholders raised a wide range of questions about the practicalities of the\nProposed Scheme. The Applicants stated that in due course BCLP would reply\nto any objections received, and that:\n“Leaseholder observations have been considered in detail. However, there\nwas nothing in them that Almacantar or their team felt necessitated a\ndeparture from the proposed approach. Almacantar has confirmed that they\nare taking steps to provide leaseholders with the information that they have\nrequested on patch repair, even though this is not a methodology they\napprove of.\n…\nOne of the main observations from the leaseholders was disputing whether a\nfull replacement was required and that a repair solution should be\nconsidered.\n[Jonathan Evans] confirmed that Almacantar have looked at all viable\noptions.\nAlmacantar has stress tested different options with Dr Harris and the\nprofessional team to ensure we are taking the most reasonable approach.\nAlmacantar has previously dismissed the option to repair the existing façade\nas this is more expensive and will be very difficult to obtain a warranty for\nthis work. Dr Harris has always been of the view that a patch repairs is not a\nsolution he would recommend.\n…\nDr Harris has finalised a specification for the repair option. That\nspecification has been provided to Almacantar’s quantity surveyors (WT\nPartnership) and they are preparing costings. Once this has been finalised\nthis will be sent to the leaseholders and their appointed surveyor to review.\nThis is not something that Almacantar had previously thought necessary, but\nwe have instructed this exercise to help move matters forward with the\nLeaseholders.\nFollowing the issuance of this information, Dr Harris has offered to organise\na meeting with leaseholders and their appointed surveyor to talk them\nthrough this and answer any questions.”\n98. In November 2021, WTP provided a draft revised costs estimate for the\nProposed Scheme [ExB 1234 – 1259] and issued pre-qualification\nquestionnaires for return by contractors approached to tender, for return by\n25 November 2021 [EvB 1472 – 1480].\n99. On 22 November 2021, Dr Harris provided a report to the Applicants\nregarding the condensation risk in the façade [EvB 1481 – 1506].\n100. On 26 November 2021, HML provided a report to leaseholders\nregarding the leaseholder-proposed patch repair of the façade [EvB 1511 –\n33\n\n1518], and made it clear that the Applicants had rejected the possibility of\npatch repair on the advice of its professional team [EvB 1507 – 1510].\n101. On 2 December 2021, BCLP wrote to the leaseholders about decanting, and its\nphasing strategy for the works. It asked leaseholders to return a response\nsheet, indicating receipt of the letter, intention to decant, and details of the\noccupation of the flat concerned [EvB 1519 – 1522]. It is unclear if\nleaseholders responded.\n102. At a residents’ meeting on 13 December 2021, Dr Harris explained the\ndifference between the Proposed Scheme, a like-for-like replacement, and a\npatch repair scheme, highlighting the time, cost and disruption differentials\ncaptured by the note at [EvB 1508 – 1510] provided previously. There are\ncompeting minutes from the Applicants and the leaseholders at [EvB 1521 -\n1533], revealing that that meeting cannot have been a pleasant one for\nanyone concerned. The leaseholders’ former expert continued to advocate (we\nuse that word advisedly, as that was what he was indeed doing despite\navowing otherwise) for a patch repair scheme, and continued to suggest there\nwas insufficient evidence to support the Proposed Scheme. Rather\nsurprisingly, without any obvious evidential foundation, that former expert\nappears to have asserted that Dr Harris was being “controlled by” BCLP, such\nthat he was not neutral, and he required to see evidence that pre-dated Dr\nHarris’s involvement [EvB 1529]. He posited, again without any obvious\nevidential foundation, that the problem with the façade was a lack of trickle\nventilation. He disputed that service life of a system had any relevance to\ndisrepair or what could be done to put a system into repair. It is evident that at\nthe date of that meeting, 11 flats still had not secured their windows.\n103. By letter dated 23 December 2021, BCLP responded to the\nrepresentations made by leaseholders in reply to the section 20 Notices of\nIntention [EvB 1535 - 1545]. That letter made clear that 4 responses had\nbeen received to pre-qualification questionnaires: from Iconic Build (‘Iconic’),\nDako Construction, MCD Group, and Claritas. Tenders would be invited, and\non receipt of returns the Applicants would share feedback from the\ncontractors on the Proposed Scheme as regards cost, phasing, decant,\ntimeframe and anticipated programme. The historic documentation regarding\nthe state of the façade was shared by a file transfer link, and BCLP set out in\nsummary that the façade had been on “borrowed time” for some years. It was\nmade clear that five options for putting the façade into repair had been\nconsidered, but that the advice from professionals was that the best option\nwas the Proposed Scheme, which the Applicants considered was the best value\nand most reasonable option, and did not amount to an improvement. Patch\nrepair had been rejected for many reasons, including cost, time, the need for a\n100% proof test, and the ongoing need for regular and expensive intrusive\nmaintenance into the future.\n104. In January 2022, WTP provided a tender pack for the Proposed\nScheme [EvB 1546 - 1767].\n105. Tender returns were received from Claritas [ExB 1264 – 1745] and\nfrom Iconic [ExB 1746 – 1842] on 5 April 2022 [EvB 1768 – 1769]. At a\n34\n\nresidents’ meeting on 23 May 2022 [EvB 1770 – 1775], the leaseholders\nwere informed that a post tender review was being carried out. It was made\nclear that, so far as the Applicants were concerned, they had answered all of\nthe questions put to them by the leaseholders’ former expert.\n106. Various post-tender interviews were carried out [ExB 1843] and\nqueries answered [EvB 1783 – 1789]. WTP provided its tender report\nanalysis for the Proposed Scheme on 20 September 2022 [ExB 697 – 759].\nIn it, WTP explained the reason why only two tenders were received; of the 19\ncontractors approached, four had expressed an interest. The remaining\ncontractors had broadly indicated that they considered that the contract was\nnot worth enough money, or that the risks were too high. Low-profit-high-risk\nwas not attractive [ExB 2334].\n107. Of the four who has expressed an interest, MCD had not been able to\nprovide evidence of the required experience (as we understand it, due to being\nunder NDAs). Dako Construction had been preparing its tender submission\nbut dropped out a matter of days before the closing date due to being offered\nanother opportunity elsewhere. Claritas’s submission was not compliant as\nthey had refused to offer a phased alternative, and they had failed to specify\nthe Raico system indicated. They had proffered an alternative Raeyners\nsystem instead of, rather than as well as the Raico one. The Raeyners system\nwould project too much from the concrete frame. They had not taken up the\nreferrals to WTP’s supply chain notified by the addendum during the tender\nperiod, preferring to use their ‘own trusted supply chain’ for the alternative\nproduct. They had also indicated that they were not interested in continuing\nnegotiations unless they had a realistic chance of being appointed. Claritas’s\ninitial bid was £1,786,566 higher than Iconic’s. Post-bid negotiations had\nconsequently been entered into only with Iconic.\n108. The negotiations had resulted in increased contract sums, but they\nwere no longer heavily caveated, or provisional, and were substantially fixed\n(save for the cost of the Raico system itself – 14.6% of the tender value –\nwhich was subject to an inflation mechanism) until 15 October 2022. There\nwas also a phased reoccupation option available. Iconic’s bid for a full decant\noption was, by the end of the process, £7,041,410.92, or for a phased\nreoccupation option £7,347,015.00. WTP provided a reconciliation between\nits pre-tender estimate and the tender submissions [ExB 723]. It explained\nthat it needed to adjust its own pre-tender estimate to ensure a like-for-like\nbasis (including inflation and an allowance for a novated design team), and\nthat its updated pre-tender estimate (full decant basis) would therefore be\n£6,116,104.94. It considered that the reasons for the circa £925k difference\nbetween its updated figure and Iconic’s bid included the unprecedented tender\nprice inflation brought about by macro-economic factors, including Brexit,\nCovid-19, and the war in Ukraine, and logistical access issues presented by the\npeculiarities (particularly the location) of the site.\n109. The tender report prepared by WTP was sent to leaseholders under\ncover of letter dated 30 September 2022 [EvB 1790 – 1803]. In summary,\nBCLP reiterated that appropriate professional advice had been sought and\nreceived by the Applicants; that that advice was that the Proposed Scheme was\n35\n\nrequired to be undertaken in pursuit of the Applicants’ repairing covenants;\nthat the Proposed Scheme did not go beyond the Applicants’ repairing\ncovenants and was not ‘improvement’; that any proposed patch repair scheme\nwas not technically or practically evidenced, costed, or programmed, and the\nApplicants did not consider it viable for multiple reasons as set out; that there\nwas no alternative realistic option to the Proposed Scheme; that programming\nof the works on a full or phased decant basis had been considered and a full\ndecant was to be pursued; that the Applicants could assist with relocation as a\nrechargeable service-charge cost; and that unless unanimous agreement to the\nProposed Scheme was obtained by 7 October 2022, an application would be\nmade to the Tribunal before contractors were engaged, which would likely\nresult in the project requiring re-tendering and increased costs. The letter\nnoted that it remained the case that some leaseholders had not secured their\nwindows. It also proposed mediation so long as all leaseholders were involved.\nBCLP encouraged careful review of the documents provided to the\nleaseholders to date, of which it provided a schedule [EvB 1804 – 1810].\n110. 1985 Act section 20 Notices of Estimates, together with a summary of\nobservations received and responses, were given to leaseholders on 7 October\n2022 [EvB 1816 – 1837]. Evidently, the Applicants did not achieve the\nunanimity that they considered was required, and this application was made\nin January 2023.\n(d) The Issues\n111. Against that background, the issues to be decided by us can be put\nrelatively succinctly:\n(i) If costs were incurred for the Proposed Scheme and QLTA, would a\nservice charge be payable in principle; and\n(ii) By whom would it be payable?\n112. Those questions are those as set out in section 27A(3) of the 1985 Act. The\nsecond question, which arises under section 27A(3)(a), necessitates a\ndetermination of whether paragraph 8 of schedule 8 of the Building Safety Act\n2022 (‘the 2022 Act’) applies.\n113. The more specific matters, including the legal principles to be applied, we deal\nwith in the relevant sections below.\n(e) If costs were incurred for the Proposed Scheme and QLTA, would a\nservice charge be payable by the Respondents to the Applicant?\nIntroduction\n114. The determinations we must make are confined by the application that has\nbeen made. The overarching decision we must make is whether, if costs were\nincurred for the Proposed Scheme, those costs would be payable by the some\nor all of the leaseholders (taking into account any finding we make in respect\nof the application of the 2022 Act) as service charges.\n36\n\n115. The sub-issues of that question were identified in the directions following the\nPTR. Some of those issues have now fallen away. For example, no leaseholder\npursues any argument now regarding apportionment of the Proposed Scheme\nbetween the residential and commercial parts of CPH, as it is now accepted\nthat the works will not benefit the commercial area. We find it convenient to\ngroup others of the remaining questions into the broad themes below.\n116. In part one, we deal with the primary question under the 1987 Act, which is:\n“whether, if costs were incurred for services, repairs, maintenance,\nimprovements, insurance or management of any specified description, a\nservice charge would be payable for the costs”.\n117. We pause consideration of by whom to part two, where we will consider the\neffect of the 2022 Act on the question.\n118. We pause consideration of an additional submission that set-off falls to be\nconsidered to part three. It is said to engage the question in section 27A(3)(e) -\nthe manner of payment of any such sum as would be payable.\nPART ONE\n(1) Preliminary issue – Amount of any Service Charge for the\nProposed Scheme and QLTA\n119. At the outset of the hearing, as we had done at the emergency CMH the\nprevious week, we raised with the Applicants the problem we perceived with\ntheir application as framed, as it asked us to identify a specified amount that\nwould be payable in the future (pursuant to section 27A(3)(c)).\n120. The only evidence we had before us was that which showed what the\ncontract price would have been, if it had been let in October 2022. There was\nno indication on the evidence in the bundle that Iconic were still willing and\nable to undertake the Proposed Scheme, when, or at what price. To the extent\nit appeared from [ExB 1262] that WTP had carried out an inflation\ncalculation of the Iconic sum using WTP’s own in-house indices for central\nLondon, taking the figure to Q3 of 2024, the calculation itself set out that\n“[t]he above is a forecast of inflation only and is yet to be evidenced by\ntender returns”. We had no evidence that Q3 of 2024 is the correct date for\nany inflation calculation (and we note that at least one of the ASTs granted by\nMr Savage appears to have no break clause, with the fixed term due to expire\n19 September 2024 [CB 163]) and nothing by which to assess WTP’s in-house\nindices. No section 27A(1) application had been made in respect of the reserve\nfund demands such that we could engage with the question of whether the\nsums demanded were a reasonable estimate in accordance with section 19(2)\nof the 1985 Act. The application was brought only looking to the theoretical\nfuture rather than the crystalised past.\n121. It seemed to us that therefore the Applicants were faced with two\noptions. Either, knowing that the sum calculated by WTP was in all likelihood\nunreliable, exercise its choice and commit itself to a fixed position that the\ncosts would be that sum, which we would have to decide whether we could\n37\n\nmake a finding on, or be content with a determination under section 27A(3)\nthat was in more general, ‘in principle’ terms. The Applicants elected the latter\napproach.\n122. All parties indicated that they wished us to give the market testing\nquestion consideration. We made it clear that, because we would be looking at\na past contract sum, in respect of which there was no evidence the contract\nwas still available to let and in respect of which there was no section 27A(1)\napplication, our indications thereon would be no better than obiter and could\nnot be relied on in any future application that might arise under section\n27A(1). Indications would not be ‘findings’, and no appeal would lie against\nthem. We were encouraged to view the question as one that might ‘put to bed’\n(our words) some of the disputes between the parties. We therefore agreed to\nproceed on that basis, but our indications in the ‘Market Testing’ section\nbelow therefore come with that strong user-warning.\n(2) Is a service charge payable in respect of the Proposed Scheme\nand QLTA in principle?\n123. The first question we turn to is whether the Applicants have the\nobligation to carry out the works that are encompassed in the Proposed\nScheme, and if they do, does the Applicant have the right to demand, and do\nthe Respondents have the obligation to make, payment for them. There are\nthree questions that arise in consideration of the question: does the lease\npermit of recovery for works of repair to the façade in general; is the façade in\nrepair in accordance with the covenants in the lease; and does the Proposed\nScheme encompass works within those terms.\n(i) Is maintenance of the façade within the Applicants’ obligations in the\nleases?\nA. Evidence\n124. A copy of the lease for Flat 1, one of those belonging to Mr Ogilvie, is\nincluded in the bundle [CB 134]. We understand that the leases for the other\nflats are in identical terms. In that lease, the relevant provisions are as follows:\n1. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION\n1.1 In this lease where the context so admits the following\nexpressions shall have the following meanings respectively:\n“Apartment” means the Demised Elements of those parts of\nthe third and fourth floors of the Building shown edged red\non the plan…\n…\n“Demised Elements” means and includes in relation to\nany premises (for the purposes of obligation as well as grant):\n(a) The internal surfaces of all walls (both internal and\nexternal) floors and ceilings bounding or within such\n38\n\npremises and the air space within the same and the whole\nof all window and door frames and doors thereof (other\nthan such of the surfaces thereof as form part of the\nexterior of the Building) and the glass in such window\nframes…\n…\n“Retained Parts” means the remainder of the Building not\ncomprised in the Apartment the Demised Elements of the\nother apartments within the Residential Premises the\nCommon Parts or the Demised Elements of the Commercial\nPremises\n…\n3. The Tenant hereby covenants with the Landlord at all times\nduring the said term as follows:\n…\n3.3 Well and substantially to repair maintain clean and keep the\nApartment including where necessary or otherwise required\nhereunder the renewal or replacement of any fixtures and\nfittings and plant forming part thereof…\n3.10 To permit the Landlord and the tenants or occupiers of any\npremises in the Building and their respective employees agents\nand surveyors with or without workmen and others and those\nauthorised by them after reasonable notice in writing and at\nreasonable business hours (except in emergencies) to enter upon\nthe Apartment or any part thereof in the exercise of such rights\nas are excepted and reserved unto them pursuant to schedule 2\n...\n3.21\n3.21.1 To pay to the Landlord in the manner hereinafter\ndescribed the Service Charge\n3.21.2 The Service Charge shall be 1/36 of the amount\nexpended in each service charge year... by the\nLandlord providing the services and fulfilling the\nobligations set out in part 1 of schedule 3 and a fair\nproportion of like amount in regard to part 2 of\nschedule 3\n4. The Landlord hereby covenants with the Tenant as follows:\n…\n39\n\n4.2 Subject to the payment by the Tenant of the Service Charge\n(and the advance payments relating thereto) to fulfil the\nobligations and to provide the services details whereof are set\nout in schedule 3 provide that the Tenant shall have no rights of\nclaim against the Landlord on account of the non-provision or\nnon-fulfilment thereof due to any cause outside of the\nLandlord’s control\n…\nSCHEDULE 3\n…\nPart 2\n1. To keep the Retained Parts in good and substantial repair and\ncondition and free from pests including where necessary the\narrangement of suitable maintenance contracts in connection\nwith and the testing and replacement of the Conduits fixtures\nand fittings and similar items forming part of the Retained Parts\nprovided that where items are replaced the Landlord shall\nensure that the replacements are of an equal standard to those\ncurrently installed\n2. To redecorate or treat as appropriate the parts of the Retained\nParts which are usually or which ought to be so treated whenever\nnecessary with suitable materials of good quality in a good and\nworkmanlike manner and so often as may be necessary to clean\nthe external brickwork and other facings or cladding of the\nRetained Parts.\nB. Decision\n125. As can be seen from the combination of the definitions and clauses\nabove, in simplistic terms the leaseholders are responsible for the repair of the\ninternal surfaces including window frames and the glass in the window\nframes. The external parts of the window frames are retained, as is the\nremaining structure on which the glass and frames sit. The spandrel zones,\nwhere the glazing and its construction are not accessible from within the flats,\nare ‘exterior’ and therefore retained.\n126. In relation to those retained parts, the Applicants have the obligation to\nkeep the retained parts in good and substantial repair and condition. The\nobligation to ‘keep...in good and substantial repair and condition’ is also an\nobligation to ‘put’ the retained parts in good and substantial repair and\ncondition, if the retained parts are not in that condition (Saner v Bilton (1877-\n78) LR 7 Ch.D 815). In legal terms, this is usually referred to as ‘to (put and)\nkeep’ as a shorthand. We will adopt that shorthand.\n40\n\n127. The Respondents have the obligation to pay a fair proportion of the service\ncharges for those works, the Proposed Works being ones that fall within the\nApplicant’s obligations in part 2 of schedule 3.\n(ii) Is the façade at CPH in good and substantial repair and condition?\nA. Evidence\n128. It is Ms Stedman’s pleaded case [CB 39 - 52] that the\nApplicants’ section 27A(3) is a cynical application driven by corporate greed,\nto improve the cosmetic look of CPH for the benefit of their wider business\ninterests in the Centre Point estate. The Applicants had a plan, she says, from\nthe minute they bought Targetfollow out of administration, to undertake a\nredevelopment project in respect of the whole Centre Point estate. Leaving\nCPH in a “tired and rundown” state in the middle of the “upscale eateries,\nredeveloped iconic Centre Point Tower, the adjoining ‘Link’ turned into an\nupmarket restaurant village and the lower levels of CPH itself turned into a\nvast array of shiny, gleaming new retail/commercial outlets”, next door to\nthe “golden” redevelopment at St Giles High Street/Denmark Street/Charing\nCross Road, and mere metres away from all of the new Crossrail development\nincluding new buildings, a new theatre, and new access to public transport,\ncould never have been in the Applicants’ plan. Her position is that the\nApplicants are attempting to get leaseholders to pay for the redevelopment of\nCPH is, in effect, a ruse (our word) to get the Consented Scheme works done\neven though the leaseholders’ did not accept it unanimously. It was the\nApplicants’ fault that unanimity was not achieved, because of the selfish\nconditions the Applicants’ put on the leaseholders’ acceptance of the\nConsented Scheme which would have deprived the leaseholders of their\ncontractual and common law rights. The Applicants were now trying to\n“rewrite history” to disguise their “long-running, commercially driven, desire\nfor the façade to be improved by replacement of ‘tired’ and dirty with clean.”\n129. Ms Stedman considered that any attempt by the Applicants to prove\nthat the CPH façade was or is faulty or in need of repair would be a “legal\nsleight of hand”. Their master plan had nothing to do with any part of the\nfaçade being in decay or danger. She had not been presented with “evidence\nthat unequivocally convinces me that there is an actual need for these\nworks”. The whole focus of the Applicants was improvement. The state of the\nfaçade is still “open to debate” and the Applicants’ only motivation is to\nimprove CPH so it is more appealing when viewed from Centre Point Tower\nand to increase the value of the retail units below.\n130. Ms Stedman also submitted that, if CPH was indeed not in repair, that\nwas because of the works in the wider Centre Point estate having caused\nvibrations and damage to CPH. She considered that the window incident was\ncaused by the Applicants’ own neglect of its retained flats. She told the\nTribunal her own flat was in perfect condition after the 2010 works, though\nshe could point to no independent evidence.\n131. Ms Stedman’s oral evidence was brief, firm, and consistent with these themes.\nHer evidence made amply clear the very strong depth of feeling the\n41\n\nleaseholders have, and what they have had to tolerate living in the middle of,\nin effect, a building site.\n132. In closing Mr Stedman stated that his daughter’s proposition was\nsimple. The Applicants should bear the costs of the Proposed Scheme, and the\nleaseholders should bear none. The Applicants had from the outset wanted to\ncarry out the Consented Scheme not because they knew about the state of the\nfaçade - about that knowledge, Mr Stedman suggested Mr Waite and Mr\nEvans were lying - but for their own commercial interest. They had only been\nunable to do so because of the outrageous conditions that they had put on\nagreement to the Consented Scheme, and the requirement for unanimity. The\ncosts that the Applicants now seek are the very definition of unreasonable and\ndisproportionate. His daughter was a representative ‘everyman’ – she was a\nteacher with two children, earning a teacher’s salary, who was unable to pay\nthe extraordinary sums demanded as an average citizen. The application failed\nthe reasonableness test.\nB. Decision\n133. We do understand how living in the middle of the Applicants’\nconstruction in relation to the other buildings on the estate, including while\nthey were breaking through the floor slabs immediately below at CPH to\ndevelop the commercial premises, must have been deeply intrusive. That was\nexacerbated by the Crossrail development and the building works next door.\nWe are not surprised that Ms Stedman felt the need to move out, as did Mr\nOgilvie.\n134. However, while we have sympathy with Ms Stedman’s position, as we\nexplained to Mr Stedman at the PTR and again at the emergency CMH we are\nonly able to make decisions on the basis of the evidence before us. We do not\nwish to undermine Ms Stedman’s or Mr Ogilvie’s lived experience, but we can\nonly make our decision on the basis that we can be satisfied on the balance of\nprobabilities that Ms Stedman’s position is correct.\n135. There is no expert report or other independent evidence that supports\nMs Stedman’s position. The expert reports of Dr Harris and Mr Gray, and the\nbackground as set out in part (c) above, firmly establish that the works\nundertaken in 2010 did not put CPH into perfect condition – indeed\nTargetfollow appears to have instructed that such works as did take place (the\nextent of which remains unknown to this day) should only have the effect of\nextending the life of the façade for between 7 – 10 years, because they\nintended to either demolish or redevelop CPH [EvB 63 at 1.3]. That decision\nwas made in the full knowledge that the façade was already beyond its design\nlife and already suffering from those problems identified later by Dr Harris\n[EvB 63 at 2.4]. The reports from the party wall experts [EvB 701 et seq],\nretained by the leaseholders and the Applicants respectively in the course of\nthe wider estate works, identify no damage to the façade as a result of\nmovement or vibrations, such that the poor condition of CPH (which Ms\nStedman continues to reject the existence of) could be considered to have been\ncaused by the Applicants’ development works. While it is possible that Ms\nStedman’s flat has no observable indicators internally of what is occurring in\n42\n\nthe façade, that does not lead to the conclusion that the façade is in perfect\ncondition. Ms Stedman’s position is in the face of the evidence, and we must\ntherefore reject it.\n136. There is no objective evidence to support Ms Stedman’s conclusion that\nthe façade works are motivated by corporate greed and that the Applicants, in\nbringing the application, are engaging in some cynical legal sleight of hand.\nThat is an allegation tantamount to fraud, and cogent evidence is required to\nenable us to make such a finding. We do not have any evidence except for Ms\nStedman’s strength of feeling, developed in the context of a relationship that\nhas increasingly soured from 2011, exacerbated by the works occurring around\nCPH. We acknowledge her feelings, but we cannot be satisfied by feelings\nalone that the application is anything but genuinely motivated by the need for\nthe Applicants to meet their repairing obligations, in light of the evidence\nbefore us.\n137. We are satisfied that the Consented Scheme and Proposed Scheme are sets of\nworks that are differentiated and are not the same as suggested. Although\nthere are naturally some elements that will appear similar, for example the\nreplacement of the façade, as both schemes are and were concerned to achieve\nthat outcome, the Consented Scheme went substantially further in what was\nproposed for the ‘wrap’ around CPH, including its balconies. The differences\nare reflected in the drawings provided by MICA at [EvB 972 – 974].\n138. In the circumstances, and in light of the expert evidence of Dr Harris\n[ExB 16 et seq] and Mr Gray [ExB 127 et seq], and in accordance with the\nindependent reports and other documents commissioned by the successive\nlandlords prior to the acquisition of it by the Applicants’ parent company\n[EvB 9-289] we find that the façade at CPH is not in good and substantial\nrepair and condition, has been inherently defective from the date it was\ncompleted, and its physical condition has deteriorated over time as a\nconsequence.\n139. As regards Mr Stedman’s final submission (the reasonableness\ntest), in the application that has been made to us we have not been given the\njurisdiction to decide whether the sums demanded for payment to the reserve\nfund are reasonable or proportionate. That matter must be left for another day\nif it becomes necessary.\n(iii) Is the façade replacement as set out by the Proposed Scheme work of to\nput the façade into good and substantial repair and condition?\n140. In reality, by the end of the hearing no leaseholder, save for perhaps Ms\nStedman, actively maintained that maintenance of the façade, including the\nwindows, was not within the Applicants’ repairing obligations. Mr Ogilvie\nmade clear he considered that the works needed to be done, and that his main\ngrievance is the Applicants’ lack of consideration of the fact that they are\ndemanding sums of money be paid with no consideration to the means of the\nRespondents to pay them as demanded.\n43\n\n141. We do not consider that Ms Stedman’s case is concerned with quite the same\nquestion. It is her position that the Proposed Scheme is works of improvement\nas the facades are not out of repair at all. We have dealt with that in our\ndecision above.\n142. Initially, in their Skeleton Argument provided after the CMH at which\nwe made clear that the question would not be reopened without good reason,\nthe leaseholders represented by Mr Negyal maintained that the Proposed\nScheme included elements of improvement outside of the Applicants’\nobligations in the lease. In advance of his closing submissions, Mr Negyal\nhanded up to us an amended Skeleton Argument, in which he removed those\nparagraphs and stated the point was conceded.\n143. Mr Weeks and Mr Negyal nevertheless expressed discontent, in cross\nexamination of the Applicants’ witnesses, at the way that their former expert\nhad been treated by the Applicants, such that he could not give them the\nadvice he had promised, ‘good or bad’, to conclude the matter. The position\nthey took was that the Applicants, or their solicitors, had been heavy-handed,\nrude, and obstructive in the resolution of this case in informing their then-\nexpert that (to paraphrase) legal questions should be put to a lawyer, through\na lawyer. They also took the view that Dr Harris had been personally rude and\nobstructive to their former expert in terming the questions he posed\n‘scattergun’ and refusing to answer reasonable questions. They took the view\nthat the Applicants had thereby obstructed the leaseholders in coming to a\nresolution of the issue.\n144. We provide our observations on this issue to the leaseholders, as we\nbelieve that the leaseholders need some reassurance that they have made a\nproper concession. It is also convenient to deal with it if, to any extent it forms\npart of Ms Stedman’s case.\n145. We have real concerns about the advice that the leaseholders obtained\nfrom their former expert. There has been a good deal of consideration and\ncomment in higher courts recently on experts overstepping their expertise or\nroles (we are aware of no fewer than 20 in the past 24 months, the most recent\nbeing Balachandra v The General Dental Council [2024] EWHC 18, and\namongst which GKE v Gunning [2023] EWHC 332 (KB) and Rowbottom v\nThe Estate of Peter Howard & Anor [2023] EWHC 931 are prime examples of,\nrespectively, the wrong expert being chosen for the expert evidence required,\nand the expert’s inappropriate failure to take into account any evidence that\ndid not support their own conclusions). We consider it apparent that the\nleaseholders’ former expert fell into similar error [EvB 1158].\n146. We will not name that individual, as he has not had the opportunity to\nprovide an explanation for his conduct. Nevertheless, we can identify no\nfewer than 27 paragraphs of his report to leaseholders in which the former\nexpert gives legal advice, or in which he goes beyond his expertise. An example\nof the former appears in the following paragraphs:\n“5. The tenants have an obligation to repair, maintain and clean their\nApartments (which effectively means the Demised Elements, so\n44\n\nincludes the glass in the windows plus the window frames - except the\nexternal surfaces of the window frames).\n6. The landlord has an obligation to keep the Retained Parts (which\nincludes the external surfaces of the window frames) in good and\nsubstantial repair and condition.\n7. The relationship between these definitions and obligations should be\nconsidered. Firstly, given the design of the cladding, what would be\nconsidered to be a window frame, and what would not? Ultimately\nthis is a legal question but these sorts of issues which I have to\nconsider frequently in my practice.\n8. Reference to Dowding and Reynolds does not provide much\nassistance in this instance. They refer to the case of Twinmar Holdings\nv Klarius (which considered whether roof lights in an industrial\nbuilding were windows – they weren’t). They include the following\nextracts from the judgement:\n“31 … In the context of a lease, I consider that the essential\ncharacteristics of a window are that it is a glazed panel in a\nframe that is set into the external envelope of a building\n(although sometimes there can be internal windows to allow\nthe passage of light within a building), the purpose of which is\nto let in light and, usually, to enable those in the building to see\nout. However, sometimes windows are specially treated, for\nreasons of either privacy or security, to prevent someone\noutside the building from seeing in. But in my view this does not\nmean that it is no longer a window: it is just a particular type\nof window. Further, it is reasonably clear that a window does\nnot have to be in a vertical plane: opening glazed roof lights\n(such as the \"Velux\" type window) are in my view properly\ndescribed as windows.\nWhilst many windows are capable of being opened, this is not\nan essential characteristic of a window.\n“32 For the purposes of this case I leave out of consideration the\nmodern glazed curtain wall, or similar structures, where glass\npanels may be mounted on a metal frame. These are not\nwindows in the sense of being glazed panels set into a frame,\nbut whether they are to be regarded as windows or part of a\ncurtain wall is a question that would have to be decided by\nreference to the terms of the relevant lease if and when the\npoint arises.”\n9. It therefore appears to be an open legal question as to the extent to\nwhich the curtain walling would be described as a ‘window’. Those\nparts of the curtain walling which provide light to the Apartments\nwould, at least in the first instance, presumably be regarded as\nwindows (and would be demised to the tenants – except the external\nsurfaces of the frames thereof), and the spandrel panels which do not\nprovide light to the apartments would not be regarded as ‘windows’\n(and therefore would be retained by the landlord).\n10. It might also be the case though, given that Sandberg indicate that\nthe framing of the windows and of the spandrels is structural (because\nthat timber framing supports the spandrels and windows) that the\ntimber framing is actually a Retained Part, and just the opening parts\n45\n\nof the windows (within that timber framing) are demised to the\ntenants.\n11. I proceed on the basis that this assumption is correct, because it\nseem [sic] more logical for the long leaseholders not to be responsible\nfor structural parts of the building.”\n147. We are also concerned that the former expert appears to have given\ninsufficient consideration to whether he had the relevant expertise on façade\nsystems to proffer the advice he was giving on repair options. He identified\nhimself that he was not a cladding expert, but nevertheless continued to posit\nthat the façade could be repaired by a patch repair scheme, and the\ncondensation issue resolved by trickle ventilation. That does not appear to\nhave been based on any knowledge or understanding of the façade, or indeed\non his understanding of Dr Harris’s reports.\n148. He appears to have taken that view on the basis that he mistrusted Dr\nHarris simply because he was the Applicants’ expert. In this he appears to\nhave fallen into error, by adopting the leaseholders’ own then-position that the\nonly reason for the Proposed Scheme was to ‘improve the performance and\nappearance of the building’, rather than to meet its repairing covenant. That\nimpression is further underscored by the fact that he recites at paragraph 71\nthat Dr Harris does not appear to have considered any other options, even\nthough (i) Dr Harris says explicitly in his reports that he has (and recounts\nthem), (ii) the evidence was provided to the former expert, and (iii) the expert\nhas no reason to disbelieve Dr Harris’s own statement. That tends to indicate\nhe has not cast himself in an expert role, but has indeed taken on the role of\nadvocate for his clients. This is further identifiable in the questions he later\nput to Dr Harris, which were focussed not on a resolution of what were the\ntechnical problems with the façade as a matter of differing expert opinion (it\ndoes not appear that he provided any such opinion), but are more apt to be\ndescribed as a cross-examination of the circumstances in which Dr Harris had\ncome to his conclusions. In a prime example, he demanded Dr Harris identify\nwhat was the wind speed was at CPH on 15 March 2021 (the night the window\nfell out). Dr Harris googled the available nearby records, the closest of which\nwas City Airport. The former expert then criticised Dr Harris for doing as he\ndid and described his answer as evasive, but no part of that question was a\nquestion for a façade expert.\n149. Ultimately, the conclusions reached by the former expert appear to\nhave been based on an incomplete understanding of both the law and of the\nfaçade system. In his letter to the leaseholders, he failed to consider or\nunderstand the nuances of disrepair versus inherent defect, the\ninterrelationship between the concept of ‘put and keep’, ‘good and substantial\ncondition’, ‘repair’ and ‘improvement’, the ‘equal standard’ provision in the\nlease, and the relationship between the windows and the façade as a whole.\nNor does he appear to have appreciated that any Tribunal, endeavouring to\ngive proper and practical effect to the landlord and leaseholders’ covenants,\nwould be keen to ensure that, so far as the lease permitted, the result should\nnot be some kind of dawn stand-off between the obligations of each. He\nappears to have fallen directly into the trap of becoming a subjective\n46\n\nparticipant in the dispute rather than an objective expert on matters within his\nexpertise.\n150. The impression that the leaseholders were consequently left with is\nmost unfortunate. They persisted in their argument that the Proposed Scheme\nis an improvement that the Applicants were not entitled to carry out. The\nleaseholders relied on their former expert’s advice in good faith and cannot be\nfaulted for that – the very reason for obtaining expert assistance is to gain a\nbetter understanding of those things one does not have the tools to\nunderstand. The flaws in the former expert’s approach and advice were\n‘unknown unknowns’ to them. They had received a recommendation for the\nindividual concerned by a party wall expert, and were not to know that the\nexpertise they were engaging was not a match for the task at hand, nor that\nthe advice they were given traversed the role of an expert. It was for the\nformer expert to properly point out that he was not the appropriate expert for\nthe job, and to avoid overstepping his expert role.\n151. In short, and the parties will forgive a large tin of gloss in one hand and a\nbroad brush in the other, there is voluminous caselaw going back decades as\nto the extent of the obligations to (put and) keep something in ‘good and\nsubstantial repair and condition’. The obligation goes beyond mere repair, and\nmay, if the circumstances require, result in something better being put in\nplace of something that is inherently, in order to put the state of the building\ninto ‘good condition’, although there may well be a degree of overlap between\nthe two concepts of ‘repair’ and ‘good condition’ in any given case.\n152. Each case turns on its own facts, but, for example, as we said in the\nhearing, the Court of Appeal has held that where a front door was inherently\ndefective by design because it had no weatherboard at its foot, so that it\nallowed rainwater to penetrate into the property, it was not in disrepair and so\nthe landlord was not liable for the water penetration. When the door itself\ncame to be in disrepair owing to the extent of the water penetration, however,\nthe landlord was entitled to repair it by ‘improving’ it in such a way as to\nprevent future water penetration, as it was the only practicable way to prevent\nfurther continuous disrepair. The local authority in that case installed an\naluminium self-sealing door (Stent v Monmouth District Council (1987) 19\nHLR 269 (CA)).\n153. Write that proposition large onto the façade of CPH and the Applicants\nfind themselves in the same position – the interstitial condensation caused by\nthe defective design of the façade is now damaging the fabric of the façade,\nincluding the supporting structure of the windows, the window stays, and\ndecoration of some of the flats internally (as was Mr Ogilvie’s evidence). In\norder to fix that problem (i.e. to put the façade into good and substantial\nrepair and condition), Dr Harris and Mr Gray agree that the only practical\nsolution is the Proposed Scheme. That Proposed Scheme will, in effect, create\na new curtain wall stuck on the existing façade, so that the existing structural\nparts of the facade will no longer have a structural function. There will, as a\nconsequence, be no further danger of the collapse of the facade due to the\ndecay or rot in the residual timbers. That will put into good condition and\nsubstantial repair the facade as it stands, and eliminate the continuing effects\n47\n\nof the inherent defects on the façade. The side effect is the additional\nconsequential improvements in the thermal properties of the design in\nconsequence of the system being a modern curtain walling system with\ndouble-glazing.\n154. The suggestion that the Applicants have no right to install the\nProposed Scheme on grounds that the internal parts and glazing of the\nwindows within that façade system are demised is, put simply, wrong. If it is\nnot possible to cure the design defect that is the cause of disrepair without\ncausing a measure of improvement, for example by the installation of new\nwindows in consequence of the design of the Proposed Scheme, that will not\nfall outside of the Applicants’ repair obligations unless the works change the\nfundamental nature of the building so that it is wholly different from what was\ndemised (Ravenseft Properties Ltd v Davstone Holdings Ltd [1980] QB 12\n(CA) and Quick v Taff Ely Borough Council [1986] QB 809 (CA)). The words\nin the lease “Landlord shall ensure that the replacements are of an equal\nstandard to those currently installed” represent a minimum standard any\nrepair works should meet, not the only standard. The Applicants’ obligation is\nnot to repetitively carry out futile work which will not remedy the underlying\ndefect causing the facades to be out of ‘good condition and substantial repair’\n(see Elmcroft Developments Ltd v Tankersley Sawyer (1984) 270 EG 140\n(CA), in respect of installation of a damp proof course). Neither does that\ncourse have to be the cheapest option, as long as it is a reasonable option\n(Manor House Drive Ltd v Shahbazian (1965) 195 EG 283 (CA), and (closer to\nhome) Waaler v Hounslow London Borough Council [2017] EWCA Civ 45\n(CA)).\n155. In consequence, had we have had to decide the issue (and if to any extent Ms\nStedman requires us to decide the issue), we would have determined that the\nworks comprised in the Proposed Scheme are not works of improvement of\nthe nature the Applicants would be proscribed from undertaking, even if a\nconsequence of carrying them out does in fact improve the condition of the\nfacade. They are works to be carried out in pursuit of the Applicants’ repairing\ncovenants to (put and) keep the façade in good and substantial repair and\ncondition.\n(iv) Was the market adequately tested?\n156. We agreed with the parties that we would deal with the question of\nwhether, in its 2022 tender exercise, the Applicants properly tested the market\nso that the contract price obtained from Iconic for the Proposed Scheme was\nwithin the range of reasonable prices obtainable on the open market at that\ntime. We reiterate that we can only make observations, not binding decisions\non the issue. We will not set out the evidence we have heard in full. No appeal\nwould lie against these observations because they are not within the section\n27A(3) decision we must make, and we make these observations only at the\ninvitation of the parties. We will therefore keep our comments as short as\nappropriate.\n157. The contract price is not the only factor for the landlord to consider when\ndetermining to whom to award a contract at the end of a tendering process. It\n48\n\nis for the landlord to decide which is the most appropriate contractor to whom\nto award a contract taking into account a range of factors, including price. As\nlong as the decision to let the contract to the particular contractor was a\nreasonable one in light of the relevant factors to that decision, even if the\ncontract price was not the lowest available, the decision would nevertheless be\nwithin the range of reasonable decisions that the landlord could make.\n158. Pausing there, that is also true of the decision in what way any scheme\nof works should be achieved – in this case, the question of the full or phased\ndecant. We know that it will be of disappointment to the leaseholders (who we\nnote in any event disagree amongst themselves), but the Tribunal does not\nhave jurisdiction to direct that a landlord take one path or another. The\ndecision is for the landlord alone. All the Tribunal can decide is whether, a\nlandlord having made its decision, that decision was or was not within the\nrange of reasonable decisions open to it in the circumstances of the particular\nset of works proposed and the range of factors to be considered. There is\nrarely only one reasonable decision open to a landlord.\n159. Returning to the question of the works, as part of that decision making\nprocess the landlord is obliged to obtain quotations as part of the consultation\nprocess. The Applicants’ tender process in this case was in pursuit of that\nrequirement.\nA. Evidence\n160. We have considered, and heard, all of the evidence on this\nmatter on which the parties relied. We have particularly considered the WTP\nCosts Estimate [ExB 614], WTP’s Tender Report [ExB 697 et seq], WTP\nCosts Estimates of 24 November 2021 [ExB 762] and the RICS Guidance\nNote on Tender Strategies [ExB 871 para 3.11], together with the reports of\nMr Nutland [ExB 283 et seq] and Mr Sullivan [ExB 247 et seq], and the\noral evidence of Mr Nutland and Mr Blowey. The parties should be assured\nthat we have heard all of the arguments and mean no disrespect if some are\nnot included below; we simply consider it appropriate to focus on the main\narguments in that context.\n161. The Respondents’ position is that that tender process was flawed. They point\nto the estimate for the Proposed Scheme provided by WTP in Q2 of 2019\nsetting out that its estimate of the sums that the Applicants should expect to\npay for the works was, at that date, £4,449,000.00. The Iconic final tender\nprice, available until 15 October 2022, was £7,041,410.00 for the full decant\noption, and £7,347,015.00 for a phased decant option [ExB 702]. Those\nsums were fixed for the whole of the Proposed Scheme save for the Raico\nsystem itself, the cost of which would be dictated by market forces (but for\nwhich an inflation mechanism was agreed). The main point of the\nleaseholders’ argument in this case is that they say the market was not\nproperly tested. It was suggested by them that the figure obtained from Iconic\nwas an attempt to ‘high ball’ the Applicants, for various reasons, and not\nwithin the reasonable range of prices obtainable on the open market at the\ntime of the tender.\n49\n\n162. Mr Doran’s experts (Mr Sullivan for the written report, and Mr Blowey\nin oral evidence) say that the difference between WTP’s estimate in Q2 of 2019\nand the final Iconic price in Q4 2022 speaks for itself that the market was not\nproperly tested. Mr Sullivan sets out his own assessment that he says should\nresult in WTP’s own estimate being within a lower range of £3,868,993.21 -\n£4,271,681.47 [ExB 261], thus widening the gap between the estimate and\nIconic’s contract price.\n163. Mr Allison asked whether the fact that Mr Sullivan undertook the\nexercise at all suggested that Mr Sullivan thought WTP has done something\nwrong initially. Mr Blowey accepted that he had seen no evidence to suggest\nthat WTP had done anything wrong.\n164. All experts agreed that ideally, a minimum of three tender returns\nshould be received in any exercise. All experts agreed that, for a variety of\nreasons, there might be fewer in fact returned. Mr Blowey suggested that\ntherefore you’d need to tender to four, or five contractors. That appeared\ninconsistent with Mr Sullivan’s and Mr Nutland’s reported three-to-six. Mr\nBlowey contextualised his experience of being in public sector procurement, in\nwhich there are rigid rules relating to tender legitimacy prior to public\nauthority approval, because it is taxpayers who pay. We understood the point\nto be that in social housing, there are no ‘leaseholders’ to whom to recharge\nthe costs of the works (or indeed the procurement process). He did not\ndisagree that there was a chance that in any procurement exercise that the\nnumber of tender returns might fall below the ‘magic number’ (our words),\nand that the private sector was not constrained by the public sector rules in\nthat scenario.\n165. The Applicant, in preparing for its tender, approached 19 construction\nfirms to complete its pre-tender questionnaires [EX 733]. They were a\nmixture of large and small-to-medium sized companies approached, within\nthe definitions that Mr Blowey appeared to us to agree (Mr Sullivan not having\nsaid in his report what he meant by that term). Mr Blowey did not suggest that\nthe small-to-medium sized contractors were inappropriate, rather that he had\nseen no evidence to show that they were appropriate.\n166. Responses were received back from all, and all but four indicated that\nthey were not interested, for a variety of reasons (e.g. that the project was not\nlarge enough to be of economic interest; the project didn’t fit with their risk\nprofile; “others may be more competitive’). Of the remaining four, MCD did\nnot pass pre-qualification questionnaire stage on the basis that they did not\ngive sufficient project detail (the evidence was that they were under NDAs for\nother projects on which they were working).\n167. Tenders were taken forward with Claritas, Iconic and Dako Construction. Mr\nBlowey agreed that he did not have any evidence to suggest that WTP had\ndone anything wrong in that regard. Neither he nor Mr Sullivan had any\nevidence to show that there was a fundamental flaw in the tender process, but\nhe did not have enough evidence to conclude there was not. He recognised\nthat WTP is a respected international Quantity Surveying firm.\n50\n\n168. Less than a week before tender returns were due, Dako dropped out as\nit had won business elsewhere. Mr Blowey found it difficult to put himself in\nthe position of the Applicant in terms of what he would have done in that\nscenario, but on questioning conceded he probably would have let the exercise\nrun its course to see what the returns were, it being so close to the deadline.\n169. Mr Sullivan took the view that there was only one valid tender return.\nMr Blowey took the view that there were no valid tender returns, because the\ntender required fixed-price contracts. Mr Sullivan suggests in his report that\nthe Claritas return was rejected because it did not specify for the Raico system\nbut for an alternative system. Mr Blowey agreed that the tender required\nspecification for the Raico system and, if a contractor though there was an\nalternative product, that could also be put forward. The alternative suggested\nby Claritas was unsuitable because the additional distance the system would\nproject out from the building frame, given CPH’s listed status. He appeared to\nmaintain Mr Sullivan’s interpretation that that was the only reason Claritas\nwas considered non-compliant and rejected by the Applicants.\n170. The leaseholders also assert that Iconic knew or it must be inferred they\ncame to know that it was the only remaining runner (our words) and may have\nexploited that situation to inflate its prices. Negotiating with one contractor\nwas against RICS guidance. Negotiation with one contractor is not negotiation\nat all – it leaves a contractor in a position to exploit a landlord’s lack of choice.\n171. Again, Mr Blowey agreed that there was no evidence that had happened, but\nthere was also no evidence that it had not happened. Both Mr Blowey and Mr\nNutland accepted that an energetic contractor can put out feelers and be left\nwith suspicions.\n172. All the experts also recognised that there was, in 2022, what might be\nreferred to as ‘a perfect storm’ in the market. The Ukraine war had just broken\nout. The Building Safety Act 2022 had just been shuffled up the Parliamentary\ntimetable by a full year. The effects of Grenfell, both on the industry and on\nthe national psyche, remained palpable (as they do to this day). Brexit and the\nCovid-19 pandemic remained significant factors in the availability of\nmaterials. The energy crisis had just begun (and of course was to deepen).\nB. Observations\n173. Were we to have been in a position to decide whether the Applicants had\nadequately tested the market, and that therefore that the Iconic contract sums\nproposed for either the full decant or phased decant options were within a\nreasonable range of those available on the open market, we would have\nrejected Mr Doran’s experts’ arguments and preferred the expert evidence of\nMr Nutland. We would have come to the conclusion that the market was\nadequately tested and, in the conditions that prevailed between April –\nOctober 2022, the Iconic prices were within the range of reasonable prices\navailable for the Proposed Works at CPH obtainable on the open market.\n174. Had we have been in a position to decide the issue, we would have been\nsatisfied that, although not ideal, the fact that only two tender returns were\n51\n\nreceived did not invalidate the tender, that those received were in\nconsequence of an appropriate tender invitation, that the Applicant had\nappropriately sought to engage 19 players in the market, and that the\nApplicants had fully expected returns from the three identified contractors\nbecause of the preparations they had made. We would not have accepted Mr\nBlowey’s approach to the evidence that, even being unable to identify that\nWTP had done anything wrong, because he had seen 'no evidence’ that what\nwas done was right either - that the tender was done properly, or that post-\ntender interviews were conducted appropriately, or that Iconic did not know\nthat they were the only remaining contractor in negotiations - we could\nproperly infer that the answers to those questions are in the negative. If the\nleaseholders wished to rely on a firm allegation, they needed to say what it\nwas. It would be inappropriate for us as a Tribunal to draw negative inferences\nfrom hints or suspicions that are not evidenced or firmly alleged. The only\nproper inference to be drawn, were we able to draw it, is that the tender was\nconducted appropriately, in light of the evidence that is available. No one\npoints to any fault on the part of WTP. WTP were faced with the market they\nwere in at the particular date.\n175. We note that the outcome of that process was that the Applicants obtained\nfrom Iconic a fixed price for the majority of the works that was still\nsubstantially below what had been Claritas’s tender return, whether on the full\nor phased decant option. In those circumstances we observe that if there is\nanyone to be described as a ‘highball bidder’ it was Claritas, but again there is\nno evidence to demonstrate that Claritas’s bid was in fact a highball bid,\nrather than a bid within the higher range of the reasonable range of estimates\nfor this particular set of works on this unique site at the date of the returns\nand in the conditions the market was then operating.\n176. We observe that the gloss put by Mr Sullivan on the rejection of the Claritas\nreturn is simply not borne out by the evidence. The WTP tender analysis is\nthorough and detailed. Claritas had refused to specify for a phased decant\noption. Their estimated price was more than £800,000 higher than Iconic’s\njust for the full decant option. Claritas indicated that they weren’t interested in\nnegotiating if they were unlikely to get the job. These were all factors in\ndeciding not to continue in negotiations with Claritas.\n177. The evidence runs contrary to Iconic having put in a highball bid. We are told\nit remains keen to carry out the work, as the project was seen as an enviable\naddition to its portfolio, both because of the iconic site and because of the\nAlmacantar’s prestige (likely to reflect well on Iconic if the job is well done). It\nwas in any event the lowest bidder. It remained actively in negotiations and\nfixed the majority of the contract price, which is something that falls at its own\nrisk. There is no evidence that Iconic knew, or suspected, it was the only\nremaining runner, and no evidence that, even if it did know, it took advantage\nof that position. It’s Rev C tender remained significantly lower than Claritas’s.\n178. We should say that, even had that not been our conclusion, we would\nnot have accepted that either WTP’s Q2 2019 estimate or Mr Sullivan’s\nunreliable recalculation was the correct cost for the works. Regarding the\nlatter, there are various problems with that calculation. Firstly, Mr Sullivan\n52\n\nuses unidentified in-house indices, such that no investigation of his base data\ncan be made. He did not provide us with the base material on which it relied.\nSecondly, other parts of the base material on which he relied were the out-of-\ndate figures from WTP in 2019 which he did not inflate to 2022. It was Mr\nNutland’s unchallenged evidence that that failure made a substantial\ndifference [ExB 325], with the effect that the higher range figure even on Mr\nSullivan’s recalculations (both of which were lower than WTP’s own by\nsignificant sums) would in fact be £5,190,092.97 [ExB 335]. As recounted in\nthe background above, WTP’s own updated estimate was £6,116,104.94 in\nSeptember 2022. Thirdly, we would have agreed with Mr Nutland that, in\ngiving no variance for the unique issues faced by constructors for the Proposed\nScheme at CPH, any such benchmarking data as Mr Sullivan used is skewed,\nand any indices less reliable. Finally, we would have agreed that giving no\nweight at all to the tender returns received from Iconic and from Claritas\nfurther skews any such assessment. There is a more nuanced approach than\n‘all or nothing’ to those returns.\n179. It also does not follow that an estimate is anything other than just that.\nWithout market testing, there is no way to see whether an estimate is in the\nballpark (our words) of what the price will in fact be. We have no doubt that if\nMr Sullivan’s company were to give an estimate alike that of WTP, its own\nestimate would also be hedged around with the same user warnings regarding\nits reliability when it came to price, as is the only sensible approach by any\nreputable QS. The estimate is not the reasonable cost of the works, as the\nworks have to be tendered in the marketplace. We would have placed no\nreliance on Mr Sullivan’s alternative calculation.\n180. We note that WTP carried out its own reconciliation between its pre-\ntender estimate and the tender submissions [ExB 723]. It adjusted its own\n2019 pre-tender estimate to ensure a like-for-like comparison, which provided\na revised figure of £6,116,104.94. Neither Mr Sullivan or Mr Blowey appears to\nhave taken that revised inflated calculation into account in coming to the\nmuch lower figures.\n181. WTP considered that the reasons for the difference between its revised\nfigure and Iconic’s bid included the unprecedented tender price inflation\nbrought about by macro-economic factors, including Brexit, Covid-19, and the\nwar in Ukraine, and logistical access issues presented by the peculiarities of\nthe site. We agree with that assessment. Both the unique logistical challenge\nand the heritage status of CPH present additional risks to contractors. Add in\nthe perfect storm of Brexit (and its impact on the labour market), Covid-19,\nthe war in Ukraine, the start of the energy crisis, and the introduction of the\n2022 Act, and the additional risks will have been uppermost in the mind of\ncontractors. Given what was happening around cladding remediation, with the\nadvent of the 2022 Act, a glut of work had just been made available. It was not\na ‘buyer’s market’.\n182. We consider that to be the explanation why so few contractors were\ninterested in undertaking the work, when measuring the risk against reward.\nWe agree that the contract was tendered during a ‘perfect storm’, such that the\nWTP estimate was not achievable when tested on the market. We recognise\n53\n\nthat it was far from ideal that only two tenders were returned, that Claritas’s\nwas uncompliant, and they were (seemingly) uninterested in negotiating or\nproviding a compliant bid. However, we accept that, in this volatile\nmarketplace caused by the perfect storm of events, the only thing an\nadditional bid was likely to do (and the experts agree, three would have been\nenough) was to increase the range of the tender returns (thus giving a wider\nspread). The receipt of only two returns did not invalidate the whole tender\nprocess, as appears to be suggested by Mr Sullivan and Mr Blowey.\n183. We therefore conclude that the Iconic bid was within the range of\nreasonable contract prices at which the Proposed Scheme could have been let\non 17 October 2022.\n184. The range of reasonable prices at which any particular set of works can\nbe let is only properly obtainable from market testing. That is why the section\n20 process requires the landlord to obtain estimates from the market. What\nwould have resulted, if we had concluded that the market had not been\nadequately tested, is that the landlord would have had to go back to market.\n185. It may be that the Applicants take the view they have to go back to\nmarket now, a year and a half later, to obtain the updated market price for the\nworks. There are of course risks to doing so. There is a cost to retendering.\nIndices used by the industry do not show that prices are lower or in a\ndownturn (or indeed static) since 2022, and it must be recognised that it is to\nthose indices that contractors will turn rather than to ONS data (as Mr Weeks\nsuggested). There is the additional factor of further international conflicts to\nconsider, with the resultant effect on availability of and lead times on\nmaterials. The 2022 Act remains in the forefront of the industry’s mind, given\nthe introduction of Part 4 of the 2022 Act. There remain issues arising from\nBrexit, particularly as regards available labour force.\n186. Conversely, it is possible that the market has settled down since 2022\nand is less risk-averse in respect of such projects, which Mr Blowey suggests is\nhis experience. There is a risk involved in not retesting the market and rather\nsimply accepting an updated price from Iconic. Going to market only ever\ntests the market conditions at a particular moment in time. If the conditions\nthat prevailed at that time were extraordinary, that may well mean that\nsomething that was within the reasonable range of prices obtainable then is\nnot reflective of the reasonable range of prices obtainable now.\n187. It is for Applicants to balance those risks and make its election as to\nthe approach it must now take. What they must make is a reasonable decision,\nfrom the range of reasonable options open to it.\n(3) Part One conclusions\n188. We conclude that if the works encompassed within the Proposed\nScheme and the QLTA were to be carried out at CPH, they are works and\nservices that fall within the Applicants’ repairing covenants, for which in\nprinciple a service charge would be payable.\n54\n\n189. The only caveat is that the Applicants’ decisions now, in order to finally\nundertake the works, must be within the range of reasonable decisions open to\nit. It is plain that the Applicants cannot avoid all risk.\nPART TWO\n(4) By whom is the service charge payable?\n190. We next turn to the question in section 27A(3)(a) – by whom the\nservice charge would be payable.\n191. Ordinarily it would follow, in leases that are all in the same terms, that all of\nthe leaseholders would be liable to pay the service charges to be incurred in\nthe Proposed Scheme and QLTA. However, in this case, a number of the\nleaseholders rely on paragraph 8 of schedule 8 of the 2022 Act.\n192. It is not disputed that CPH is a relevant building within the meaning of\nsections 117 and 118 of the 2022 Act.\n193. Paragraph 8(1) of schedule 8 provides that no service charge is payable\nunder a qualifying lease in respect of cladding remediation. At the hearing, the\nApplicants stated that they had not been provided with proof that the relevant\nleaseholders held qualifying leases. However, it was common ground that they\nhad not called in leaseholder certificates in accordance with paragraph 13 of\nschedule 8, and therefore the presumption in paragraph 13(2) that the\nleaseholders hold qualifying leases has not been rebutted. Forsters had\nprovided a list of qualifying leases for those it formerly represented on 12\nDecember 2023 [CB 162], showing that there are 10 qualifying leases in the\nbuilding held amongst the leaseholders that Mr Negyal now represents. Mr\nWeeks’ mother’s flat also qualifies, as does that of Mr Doran. There is no\nevidence to demonstrate Ms Stedman does not qualify and the presumption\ntherefore also applies to her (as we understand it her flat at CPH is the only\nflat she lets). We believe that leaves 13 flats of which the leases are non-\nqualifying.\n194. We heard from Mr Ogilvie that none of his flats qualify any longer,\nwhich is a matter of great distress to him in the context of the reason he no\nlonger occupies one of his four flats, and we understand that distress. While\nwe have sympathy with Mr Ogilvie’s position, unfortunately we cannot assist\nhim in this matter by this part of our decision, as all we can do is make\nfindings in accordance with the legal protections as they exist.\n195. There appear to us to be a series of five questions on which we must\nmake findings, in order to come to a conclusion. We address each of them in\nturn below.\n(i) Does CPH, as a building, fall within the scope of the 2022 Act?\n196. We must start with this question, as the Applicants have suggested in\nparagraph 185 of their skeleton argument that the proposition that the\nleaseholders should not have to pay for these works, even if they are in respect\n55\n\nof cladding that is unsafe within the meaning of paragraph 8 schedule 8, is\n“miles from Parliament’s intention, looking at the apparent purpose of the\nBSA 2022 and the context in which it was passed… with the result that the\nApplicants must then bear the costs which would otherwise have been borne\nby whoever holds a ‘qualifying lease’.”\n197. That argument is no further elaborated in the skeleton argument, and was not\nfleshed out orally, perhaps because of the necessary time constraints we\nimposed on what was a difficult hearing in order to ensure fairness between all\nthe parties. Nevertheless, we had already noted that sections 120 and 122 of\nthe 2022 Act were included in the Applicants’ authorities bundle. We asked\nquestions of Mr Allison in his closing in regards the relevant building question\n(CPH having been built in the mid-1960s, and the parties appearing to agree\nthat there have been no ‘qualifying works’ to it in the last 30 years). We also\nasked questions about the potential ‘floodgates’ arguments in relation to older\nbuildings.\n198. It is therefore right and proper that we address the underlying\n‘intention’ that the Applicants call in aid of their argument, however widely.\nA. Argument\n199. We asked Mr Allison to develop this argument in closing. We asked that\nhe address the ‘floodgates’ argument in particular, on the basis that it seemed\nto us that there was a possibility that the words in paragraph 8 of schedule 8\nmight lead to apparently unintended consequences, if interpreted as he\nsuggested. Buildings of significant age with poorly maintained ‘cladding’\nmight tip over to ‘unsafe’ condition and as such be caught by the 2022 Act,\ndespite not being within the class of developments that it seemed to us had\nprecipitated the 2022 Act (namely, those converted or constructed in the last\n30 years in which there are ‘relevant defects’ because of poor industry practice\nover that period). We had in mind that an argument might run that cladding,\nalthough separately provided for in schedule 8, might nevertheless be required\nto meet the ‘relevant defect’ condition in order to engage paragraph 8 (as\nforeshadowed in the wording of sections 116 and 122), and that the intention\nwas that it was only provided that condition was met that unsafe cladding\nremediation should never be paid for by qualifying leaseholders – therefore\nthe intention of paragraph 8 being limited in scope to an effect similar to\nparagraph 1 of schedule 8, such that qualifying leaseholders need not go\nthrough the waterfall provisions of paragraphs 2 – 7. The result of Mr Allison’s\nargument might be that paragraph 8 would seem to drive a coach and horses\nthrough landlord and tenant obligations as set out in the covenants of the\nleases between them, in circumstances where the landlord was neither the\ndeveloper nor an associate of the developer and any such body was long gone\nin the annals of time such that the landlord had no prospect of recovery of\nthose sums.\n200. Mr Allison submitted that the wording of paragraph 8 of schedule 8\nis not itself ambiguous – the words it uses should be given their ordinary and\nnatural meaning. Parliament could have chosen to limit the scope of the\nparagraph by use of the other terminology in the 2022 Act, for example\n56\n\n‘relevant defect’, but did not do so. The 30-year retrospective longstop from 14\nFebruary 2022 simply does not apply. Although he acknowledged that\nparagraph 8 was substantially changed by House of Lords amendment just\nless than a month before Royal Assent and did nor precipitate a debate when\nreturned to the Commons before its third reading, Mr Allison further\ncontended that paragraph 8 is entirely consistent with the DLUHC press\nrelease in January 2022 (‘the Press Release’) in which Michael Gove\n“guaranteed that no leaseholder living in their own flat will have to pay a\npenny for unsafe cladding” [R1 AB 162].\n201. Mr Negyal supported those contentions, as did Mr Weeks. Mr Stedman\nalso supported that interpretation, though we observe that Ms Stedman’s\npleaded case does not take this point.\n202. Mr Hutchings KC pointed out that the Press Release is not, of course, a\nministerial statement. He provided us with the Hansard reference (Volume\n706 Monday 10 January 2022 commencing 3.34pm).\n203. In closing, we asked Mr Hutchings whether we might conclude that the\nintended operation of paragraph 8 was to preserve the contractual rights\nbetween parties to a lease for so long as any relevant cladding was in disrepair\nbut nevertheless remained safe, but tipped over at the point at which it\nbecame unsafe with the outcome that landlords would at that point (and no\nsooner) become liable for the sums involved to remediate the consequent\ncondition. The landlord was effectively on a countdown at the end of which\ntime would have run out to repair within the covenants of the lease, and must\ntake the burden themself of the consequence of the building being allowed to\ndeteriorate so far. Was that not in accord with the purpose of the whole of the\n2022 Act – to signal that landlords and developers must prioritise, and be\nresponsible for, safety above all?\n204. Mr Hutchings KC invited us to consider that the effect of such an\ninterpretation might lead to landlords carrying out repairs before they were\ndue or warranted, so as to avoid the condition of the building falling off the\ncliff-edge. The consequence to leaseholders would be that they would end up\npaying for repairs before they were needed or justified. That would result in\nabsurdity.\nB. Decision\n(i) The legal position on statutory interpretation\n205. The parties were agreed that R (The Good Law Project) v Electoral\nCommission [2018] EWHC 2414 (Admin) was the starting point in statutory\nconstruction. The parties were also agreed that R (on the application of O (a\nminor, by her litigation fried AO)) et ors v Secretary of State for the Home\nDepartment [2022] UKSC 3 sets out at paragraphs 29 – 32 the weight to be\ngiven to external aids to construction, and the primacy to be given to the\nwords of a statute themselves.\n57\n\n206. In the Good Law Project, giving the judgment of the court, Lord Justice\nLeggatt set out the following passages regarding statutory interpretation:\nStatutory interpretation\n33. Save for one point, there is no dispute about the principles of\nstatutory interpretation. The basic principles are that the words of the\nstatute should be interpreted in the sense which best reflects their\nordinary and natural meaning and accords with the purposes of the\nlegislation. It is generally reasonable to assume that language has\nbeen used consistently by the legislature so that the same phrase when\nused in different places in a statute will bear the same meaning on\neach occasion – all the more so where the phrase has been expressly\ndefined.\n34. It is also generally reasonable to assume that Parliament intended\nto observe what Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (7th Edn, 2017) in\nsection 27.1 calls the “principle against doubtful penalisation”. This is\nthe principle that a person should not be subjected to a penalty –\nparticularly a criminal penalty – except on the basis of clear law. As\nnoted earlier, incurring referendum expenses in excess of the\nprescribed limit and, in the case of a permitted participant, failing to\nreport referendum expenses correctly are potentially criminal\noffences. In these circumstances counsel for the Electoral Commission\nand Vote Leave both submitted that the definition of “referendum\nexpenses” should be construed strictly and any ambiguity or doubt\nabout its meaning resolved in favour of the narrower interpretation\nso as to avoid doubtful penalisation.\n35. In response, counsel for the claimant cited R (Junttan Oy) v Bristol\nMagistrates’ Court [2003] UKHL 55; [2003] ICR 1475, para 84, where\nLord Steyn described this principle of statutory interpretation as one\nof last resort. Other authorities confirm, however, that that\ndescription of the principle understates its continued vitality: see e.g.\nR v Dowds [2012] EWCA Crim 281; [2012] 1 WLR 2576, paras 37-38.\nWe think the position was fairly stated by Sales J in Bogdanic v\nSecretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 2872 (QB),\npara 48, when he said:\n“The principle of strict interpretation of penal legislation is one\namong many indicators of the meaning to be given to a\nlegislative provision. It is capable of being outweighed by other\nobjective indications of legislative intention, albeit it is itself an\nindicator of great weight.”\n207. In Re O (a Minor), Lord Hodge set out the judgment with whom the\nother Supreme Court Lord- and Ladyships agreed. At paragraphs 29 – 32, he\nset out as follows:\n58\n\n28. Having regard to the way in which both parties presented their\ncases, it is opportune to say something about the process of statutory\ninterpretation.\n29. The courts in conducting statutory interpretation are “seeking the\nmeaning of the words which Parliament used”: Black-Clawson\nInternational Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG [1975] AC\n591, 613 per Lord Reid of Drem. More recently, Lord Nicholls of\nBirkenhead stated:\n“Statutory interpretation is an exercise which requires the court\nto identify the meaning borne by the words in question in the\nparticular context.”\n(R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions,\nEx p Spath Holme Ltd [2001] AC 349, 396). Words and passages in a\nstatute derive their meaning from their context. A phrase or passage\nmust be read in the context of the section as a whole and in the wider\ncontext of a relevant group of sections. Other provisions in a statute\nand the statute as a whole may provide the relevant context. They are\nthe words which Parliament has chosen to enact as an expression of\nthe purpose of the legislation and are therefore the primary source by\nwhich meaning is ascertained. There is an important constitutional\nreason for having regard primarily to the statutory context as Lord\nNicholls explained in Spath Holme, 397:\n“Citizens, with the assistance of their advisers, are intended to\nbe able to understand parliamentary enactments, so that they\ncan regulate their conduct accordingly. They should be able to\nrely upon what they read in an Act of Parliament.”\n30. External aids to interpretation therefore must play a secondary\nrole. Explanatory notes, prepared under the authority of Parliament,\nmay cast light on the meaning of particular statutory provisions.\nOther sources, such as Law Commission reports, reports of Royal\nCommissions and advisory committees, and Government White\nPapers may disclose the background to a statute and assist the court\nto identify not only the mischief which it addresses but also the\npurpose of the legislation, thereby assisting a purposive interpretation\nof a particular statutory provision. The context disclosed by such\nmaterials is relevant to assist the court to ascertain the meaning of the\nstatute, whether or not there is ambiguity and uncertainty, and\nindeed may reveal ambiguity or uncertainty: Bennion, Bailey and\nNorbury on Statutory Interpretation, 8th ed (2020), para 11.2. But\nnone of these external aids displace the meanings conveyed by the\nwords of a statute that, after consideration of that context, are clear\nand unambiguous and which do not produce absurdity. In this appeal\nthe parties did not refer the court to external aids, other than\nexplanatory statements in statutory instruments, and statements in\nParliament which I discuss below. Sir James Eadie QC for the\n59\n\nSecretary of State submitted that the statutory scheme contained in\nthe 1981 Act and the 2014 Act should be read as a whole.\n31. Statutory interpretation involves an objective assessment of the\nmeaning which a reasonable legislature as a body would be seeking to\nconvey in using the statutory words which are being considered. Lord\nNicholls, again in Spath Holme, 396, in an important passage stated:\n“The task of the court is often said to be to ascertain the\nintention of Parliament expressed in the language under\nconsideration. This is correct and may be helpful, so long as it is\nremembered that the ‘intention of Parliament’ is an objective\nconcept, not subjective. The phrase is a shorthand reference to\nthe intention which the court reasonably imputes to Parliament\nin respect of the language used. It is not the subjective intention\nof the minister or other persons who promoted the legislation.\nNor is it the subjective intention of the draftsman, or of\nindividual members or even of a majority of individual\nmembers of either House. … Thus, when courts say that such-\nand-such a meaning ‘cannot be what Parliament intended’,\nthey are saying only that the words under consideration cannot\nreasonably be taken as used by Parliament with that meaning.”\n208. Those authorities might be seen to have their origins, in terms of the\nlegal principles, set out in Pepper v Hart [1993] AC 593, which held that\nwhere legislation is ambiguous, obscure or might lead to absurdity Hansard\nmight be relied on by a court in interpreting legislation, on the condition that\nthe statements relied on in Hansard are, themselves, clear.\n(ii) Are the words of paragraph 8 of schedule 8 clear and\nunambiguous, and would it be absurd if the result of giving\nthem their clear and unambiguous effect would mean relevant\nbuildings outside the relevant 30-year period are protected?\n209. Part 5 is a self-contained chapter of the 2022 Act, and was the first to\nbe brought into force on 28 June 2022. In section 116, the scope of section 117\n– 125 and Schedule 8 are set out as follows:\n116 Remediation of certain defects\n(1) Sections 117 to 125 and Schedule 8 make provision in connection\nwith the remediation of relevant defects in relevant buildings.\n(2) In those sections –\n(a) Sections 117 to 121 define ‘relevant building’, ‘qualifying lease’,\n‘the qualifying time’, ‘relevant defect’ and ‘associate’;\n(b) Section 122 and Schedule 8 contain protections for tenants in\nrespect of costs connected with relevant defects, and impose\nliabilities on certain landlords…\n210. Sections 117 and 118 sets out the meaning and requirements of a\n‘relevant building’, and section 119 sets out the meaning of ‘qualifying lease’\n60\n\nand ‘qualifying time’. No issue is taken by any of the parties that CPH meets\nthe meaning and requirements of sections 117 and 118.\n211. Section 120 sets out the meaning of ‘relevant defect’ “for the purposes of\nsections 122 to 125 and schedule 8”, as follows:\n(2) ‘Relevant defect’, in relation to a building, means a defect as regards\nthe building that –\n(a) arises as a result of anything done (or not done) or anything\nused (or not used), in connection with relevant works, and\n(b) causes a building safety risk.\n(3) In subsection (2) ‘relevant works’ means any of the following –\n(a) works relating to the construction or conversion of the building,\nif the construction or conversion was completed in the relevant\nperiod;\n(b) works undertaken or commissioned by or on behalf of a relevant\nlandlord or management company, if works were completed in\nthe relevant period;\n(c) works undertaken after the end of the relevant period to remedy\na relevant defect by virtue of this paragraph (including a defect\nthat is a relevant defect by virtue of this paragraph).\n‘The relevant period’ here means the period of 30 years ending with\nthe time this section comes into force.\n(4) In subsection (2) the reference to anything done (or not done) in\nconnection with relevant works includes anything done (or not\ndone) in the provision of professional services in connection with\nsuch works.\n(5) For the purposes of this section –\n‘building safety risk’, in relation to a building, means a risk to the\nsafety of people in or about the building arising from –\n(a) the spread of fire, or\n(b) the collapse of a building or part of it;\n‘conversion’ means the conversion of the building for use (wholly\nor partly) for residential purposes;\n‘relevant landlord or management company’ means landlord\nunder a lease of the building or any part of it or any person who\nis party to such a lease otherwise than as a landlord or as a\ntenant.\n212. Section 122 is in the following terms:\n122 Remediation costs under qualifying leases etc\nSchedule 8 –\n61\n\n(a) provides that certain service charge amounts relating to relevant\ndefects in relevant buildings are not payable, and\n(b) makes provision for the recovery of those amounts from persons\nwho are landlords under leases of the building (or any part of it).\n213. At first blush then, it might appear that schedule 8 is only concerned\nwith relevant defects in relevant buildings.\n214. Turning then to schedule 8, it contains a series of protections that apply\nto qualifying leases. Some of the sections build on each other, and are plainly\nin respect of relevant defects in relevant buildings. For example, paragraphs 3\n– 7 identify what practitioners have been terming a ‘waterfall’ of liability that,\nwhere relevant measures are required to remediate relevant defects, the\nparties work through to identify who pays and in what amounts.\n215. Notably however, in a departure from what the overall introductions in\n116(1) and 122 might lead one initially to believe, the ‘waterfall’ is not limited\nin all its paragraphs by the terms established by sections 117 – 121 of the 2022\nAct. For example, in paragraph 2 of schedule 8, although the terminology\n‘relevant defect’ and ‘relevant building’ remain, there is no reference to a\n‘qualifying lease’. Starkly, where a relevant landlord is responsible for, or\nassociated with a person responsible for, a relevant defect in a relevant\nbuilding, no service charge is payable. There is no question of having to make\nuse of the remainder of the sections. No leaseholder pays, regardless of their\nresidential or portfolio status.\n216. Paragraph 8, with which we are concerned, makes no use of the term\n‘relevant defect’. It is stark in its language. While the proviso is made that the\nparagraph applies only to ‘qualifying leases’ (and in order to have a qualifying\nlease, that lease must be in respect of a ‘relevant building’ within the meaning\nof section 117 and 118), the simple wording at paragraph 8(1) is that “no\nservice charge is payable... for cladding remediation”. Cladding remediation is\nthen defined in 8(2), and again simply does not use the terminology 'relevant\ndefect’ with which the waterfall in schedule 8 is concerned.\n217. Consistently with that use of different language, paragraph 10(2) of schedule\n8, (which in paragraph 10(1) is stated to supplement paragraph 8, and which\nmight be described as a quasi-interpretive rather than a stand-alone\nprovision) provides as follows:\n(2) where a relevant paragraph provides that no service charge is\npayable under a lease in respect of a thing -\n(a) no costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of that thing (or\nin respect of that thing and anything else) -\n(i) are to be regarded for the purposes of the relevant\nprovisions as relevant costs to be taken into account in\ndetermining the amount of service charge payable under\nthe lease, or\n(ii) are to be met from the relevant reserve fund;\n62\n\n(b) any amount payable under the lease, or met from a relevant\nreserve fund, is limited accordingly (and any necessary\nadjustment must be made by repayment, reduction of\nsubsequent charges or otherwise).\n...\n218. ‘A thing’ must have been intentionally used in paragraph 10(2) in order\nto encompass not just defined ‘relevant measures’ applicable to other parts of\nthe waterfall - otherwise it would have said ‘relevant measures’ - but also to\nacknowledge and encompass ‘a thing’ of a different nature outside of that\ndefinition. Cladding remediation would fall squarely within its wide ambit.\n219. Paragraph 11 of schedule 8 then protects leaseholders with non-\nqualifying lessees from any increased service charge.\n220. We are satisfied that the ordinary and clear meaning to be given to the\nwords of paragraph 8 is that cladding remediation is to be treated as a distinct\nprotection outside of the waterfall, not contingent on there being a ‘relevant\ndefect’ and therefore not incorporating the requirement that the cladding in\nquestion needs to have been put on the building within the relevant period -\nthe 30 years preceding 14 February 2022 - as section 120 is not engaged. The\nuse of the words ‘a thing’ in paragraph 10(2) is entirely consistent with there\nbeing another ‘thing’ than a relevant defect. “They are the words which\nParliament has chosen to enact as an expression of the purpose of the\nlegislation and are therefore the primary source by which meaning is\nascertained”.\n221. We therefore need not go to Hansard, though had we have had to do\nso, we note that Michael Gove said in his ministerial statement, at paragraph\n16 of the written transcript at 3.34pm, that “I can confirm to the House today\nthat no leaseholder living in a Building above 11 meters will ever face any\ncosts for fixing dangerous cladding and, working with Members of both\nHouses, we will pursue statutory protection for leaseholders and nothing will\nbe off the table. As part of that, we will introduce immediate amendments to\nthe Building Safety Bill to extend the right of leaseholders to challenge those\nwho cause defects in premises for up to 30 years retrospectively.”\n222. As may be perceived, that statement poses some difficulty. The first half\nof it is consistent with the clear and unambiguous wording of paragraph 8 of\nschedule 8. The second half, at first blush, appears to elide the concept of\n‘never’ with ‘30 years’, and ‘dangerous cladding’ with ‘defects’, and therefore is\ncapable of creating ambiguity.\n223. Consistently with the second part of that statement, the Building Safety\nBill was amended to include what was to become sections 134 and 135 in the\n2022 Act. Material to the 30-year promise, section 135 increased the\nlimitation period in section 1 of the Defective Premises Act 1972 (properties\nunfit for habitation) to 30 years retrospectively, and 15 years prospectively,\nfrom claims accruing (before or on/after 28 June 2022 respectively).\n63\n\n224. As Mr Allison identified, as originally drafted, paragraph 8 of schedule\n8 in its current form did not exist in the Building Safety Bill. It was in its\npassage through the House of Lords that it was inserted (in fact, if one looks at\nLords amendment 184, the entirety of schedule 8 replaced a precursor that\nhad something else in mind entirely). It may be that therefore the equation of\n‘never’ and ‘30 years’, and ‘dangerous cladding’ and ‘defect’ had been\nintentional until that point. Nevertheless, with the amendment passed back to\nthe House of Commons, that amendment was accepted without challenge. It\nmight therefore be thought that the addition was to ensure clarity where up to\nthat point Mr Gove’s statement was either unclear or not reflected in the Bill.\nThe amendment is reflective of the speeches made by others in the House on\n10 January 2022, calling for unlimited liability in respect of cladding.\n225. What is the effect of the ordinary and natural meaning of the words\nused in paragraph 8? Primarily, that no qualifying leaseholder will ever have\nto pay for unsafe cladding remediation. That is neither unclear or ambiguous,\nand does not lead to absurdity. It accords with the schema of the 2022 Act.\n226. We are satisfied, in light of the above analysis, that CPH as a building is\nwithin the provisions of paragraph 8 of schedule 8. However, our task does\nnot stop there. We must go on to consider what the meaning of ‘cladding\nremediation’ and ‘unsafe’ are, to determine whether the qualifying\nleaseholders in CPH take the benefit of paragraph 8.\n(ii) Does CPH have ‘cladding’ within the scope of the 2022 Act?\nA. Evidence\n227. We heard first heard from Mr Evans. Two Building Safety Fund (‘BSF’)\napplications had been submitted for CPH but refused (twice). There was no\nreason given in the email rejecting the applications. He told us that all that is\nknown for certain from that email is that the BSF accepted that CPH is a tall\nbuilding. That is a matter of some regret, as the guidance given on .gov.uk\nsuggests that a landlord is to tell its leaseholders why an application is refused,\nand a landlord cannot be in a position to do so unless it has a response with\nsome detail. That in turn fosters additional distrust, as it has done in this case.\n228. We next heard from Mr Wood, who is the Architect on the Applicants’\nteam for the Proposed Scheme (as he had been for the Consented Scheme),\nworking for MICA. In his witness statement at paragraph 14 he expressed the\nview that the façade at CPH is not properly called cladding, on the basis that:\n“The professional team does not describe the project as a cladding project…\n‘cladding’ is better defined as a skin or layer applied to the outer surface of\nthe external wall of a building to provide a degree of thermal and weather\nresistance and improve its appearance. At CPH, however, the Proposed\nScheme incorporates an external walling system, which comprises glazing\nand intermediate spandrel panels that combine to form the external wall\nitself. Thermal and weather resistance, fire stopping and visual appearance\nare brought together as a unified system” [CB 226].\n64\n\n229. Pausing there for a moment, it is clear from that passage of his witness\nstatement that Mr Wood was in context talking about the Proposed Scheme,\nnot the current façade.\n230. In oral evidence, Mr Wood agreed that [SK024], [SK025] and\n[Sk026] accurately represented his understanding of the existing make-up of\nthe façade, and that the red-hatched area was what was intended to be\nremoved. In the course of questioning, Mr Allison suggested to Mr Wood that\na lay-person looking through the bundle would see lots of references to the\nfaçade as ‘cladding’, and that in reality the reason for that is that there is no\ndefinitive answer, even amongst construction specialists, to what cladding in\nfact is. Mr Wood’s response was: “Pre-Grenfell, cladding was used as a\neuphemism for anything that is stuck on a building. Post Grenfell, it is a term\nthat is much more emotive. I was in a meeting with Jonathan Evans where\nwe filled out the form for the Building Safety Fund. As we were filling out the\nform it became clear that there was very strict guidance on what [the BSF]\nconsider to be cladding. They are talking about a building with any ACM.”\n231. Mr Allison suggested that if the current system does not present a fire\nsafety risk, then it would not fall to be considered under the BSF guidance, but\nunder a different scheme, which Mr Wood accepted was possibly true – “that’s\nthe question”. When asked what he thought the current system was, Mr Wood\nstated “it’s glass”. He accepted that if that was correct, it was not combustible,\nand agreed that in those circumstances the BSF did not apply and there was\nno definition of cladding to be drawn from its guidance.\n232. Mr Allison took Mr Wood to the drawings. Mr Wood agreed that\nlocated on [SK024] could be seen a large, hatched rectangle that represented\na block-work or concrete wall. He agreed that an external face could be seen –\nthe external opaque glass spandrel panel. He agreed that if one looked at the\nbuild-up of the façade that was an external panel to keep the weather out,\nbacked with 1-inch of polystyrene insulation. He agreed that there was then a\ngap followed by a concrete wall, and that the glass was attached by what would\nbe called a simple ladder frame (albeit that some of the horizontal members\nwere taking some attachment at points).\n233. Mr Allison suggested that therefore this was similar to other cladding\nprojects – it was a non-structural element of the building keeping the weather\nout with insulation behind it and blockwork or concrete. Mr Wood disagreed –\nhe considered that he was looking at an early version of a curtain walling\nsystem in timber rather than metal, because there was no internal leaf. Mr\nAllison again identified the inner skin, cavity, and spandrel, and suggested to\nMr Wood that at the very least that was cladding restrained by an inner skin.\nMr Wood was adamant that there should be an entire ‘inner leaf’ – a timber or\nmetal frame onto which ‘cladding’ was fixed. This was an early curtain walling\nsystem. The horizontal timbers were fixed into the concrete walls and acting as\na beam and supporting the windows behind.\n234. Mr Allison again took Mr Wood through the component parts. Mr\nWood accepted that the spandrel zones supported nothing but themselves –\nthey were not structural. He accepted, when put to him by Mr Allison, that it\n65\n\nwas not a prerequisite that cladding has to provide a degree of thermal\nperformance, and that glass or aluminium would not on its own provide such\nperformance but could nevertheless be used in a cladding system.\n235. Mr Wood accepted, when Mrs Bowers asked him his view, that a\ncurtain walling system could itself be a cladding system.\n236. Mr Negyal, by reference to the [SkelA ¶172] (citing the Oxford English\nDictionary definition of cladding), and the description in paragraph 53 of the\nletter from BCLP dated 23 December 2021 [CB 275] in which the façade was\ndescribed as a “glazed envelope”, asked Mr Wood how he could maintain that\nwas not therefore an ‘external skin’ of CPH ‘providing shelter from the\nelements’. Mr Wood agreed that it was true that the façade is non-load bearing\nper se, but said that the timber framing is supporting itself, and other parts of\nthe external wall. While it was not supporting the building, it was supporting\nitself. It was a secondary structure, bolted on and supporting the weather\nprotection. It was fixed to the concrete frame and therefore became support\nfor the curtain wall - the façade is non-load bearing, but is “supporting the\nexternal wall of the building”. Mr Negyal put to Mr Wood that if the façade\nwas taken away, the building would not fall down. Mr Wood agreed.\n237. We next heard from the structural experts. Both Dr Harris and Mr Gray\nagreed, in evidence, that there was no universal definition of a ‘cladding\nsystem’ or indeed ‘cladding’ in the construction industry.\n238. Dr Harris was invited by Mr Hutchings KC to identify whether the\ntimber members, which may or may not be retained in the Proposed Scheme,\nwere an active part of the façade? Dr Harris replied that they would not be\npart of the weathering building envelope in the Proposed Scheme, in effect\nthey would be no different to a reveal board. It would in any event be more\nconvenient were the timbers to be removed in the course of constructing the\nProposed Scheme, on grounds that if they were it would be easier to insert the\nfire stopping into the new system. He explained that he was not talking about\ntimber behind the wall elements, he was talking about the external timbers,\nthat he had originally thought could support the plant-on system. He and Mr\nGray were nevertheless uncertain about whether regulation 7 of the Building\nRegulations 2010 (as amended) would apply to them, as it depended how\nBuilding Control (now the Building Safety Regulator) interpreted the façade of\nthe building if the timber was retained inactive in the system. There was\ncontradictory advice on the issue.\n239. Mr Allison took Dr Harris to [SK024] and proposed that the red-\nhatched area was that to be removed and replaced with the Proposed Scheme,\nwith which Dr Harris agreed. Dr Harris agreed that the timber mullion in the\nspandrel zone came down behind the windows at a gap of about 45mm in\ncertain vertical elevations, and that there were angle brackets fixed to the floor\nslabs. The brackets would not necessarily need to be removed for the Proposed\nWorks. The retention or otherwise of the timbers needed to be decided by the\ncontractor who carried out the works and the others in the Applicants’ team\non the regulatory and logistical side of things.\n66\n\n240. Mr Allison went through the construction of the façade with Dr Harris.\nDr Harris agreed that for some flats the façade included blockwork, and others\ncast concrete – generally described as ‘dwarf walls’. He also agreed that his\nworking theory was that those had been built after the frame had been placed,\nas the glazing had been inserted into the framing first. The dwarf walls were\nperforming a structural function, whether intentionally or not, because they\nwere holding the weight of the glazed façade through having been constructed\nin that way. His hunch was that it was intentional. [SK024] was inaccurate in\nthat it did not show that there were two floor slabs that had been inserted at\nthe horizontal member. There would be a gap between them to allow\ndifferential movement – one frame above the frame below. He agreed that\n[SK024] showed in cross section that the construction was made up of\n(outside to in) 6mm annealed glass, a 12.7mm polystyrene insulation insert,\nand a gap of at least 30mm before the blockwork or dwarf wall. He did not\nagree that what that showed was two ‘leaves’ as one would see in ACM\ncladding, although he accepted that you could argue that there was an outer\n‘layer’ and an inner ‘layer’, and that it was similar in that regard, though the\nperformance or function from that system was different. If we were looking at\na rainscreen it would be hanging on a rail system. A rail system was analogous\nto the timber frame, in that it was fixed to the structural wall behind for the\nbenefit of winds loads. Whilst it kept the water out, and he did not disagree\nthat this could be called an ‘external skin’, there were lots of ways in which one\ncould put it. Different systems worked in different ways. There had been lots\nof discussion between façade experts as to what ‘cladding’ and ‘façade’ mean.\nThe terms have been used interchangeably and that has not mattered in the\npast. Now that everyone had to decide what cladding was, Dr Harris had\nlooked at a lots of government guidance and statements, including the\nPAS9980 and the MHCLG Building Safety Fund Guidance Notes. The\nguidance in those statements often contradicted each other, and (internally)\nitself. The MHCLG Guidance seemed to indicate there literally had to be twin\nsystems. The PAS9980 was unclear as it was inconsistent and there was\nconflicting guidance.\n241. Mr Hutchings KC suggested to Dr Harris that Dr Harris’s Expert\nReport described the various elements of the facade as a ‘curtain walling\nsystem’. He asked Dr Harris is what was being replaced was a curtain walling\nsystem or something else? Dr Harris stated that the system currently on CPH\nis a timber-framed glazing system, as close to a curtain wall system as it could\nbe given its age. It was not separate systems, but one composite system. The\nexisting facade is a complete system in its own right. He understood the\nsystem as an entirely self-contained structure and weathering system. Mr\nHutchings KC suggested to him that there was no primary and secondary\nstructure. Dr Harris described a main structural frame, to which secondary\nthings could be added. His evidence was that the dwarf wall could be\nsecondary – that was indeed probable as the glazing system was sitting on it\nand it was carrying the glazing’s weight. The frame was sitting on the slab\nwhich was lifting it up. The dwarf wall could be a secondary structure, and the\nglazing system self-contained, save for that it had to be hung on the building\nsomehow.\nB. Argument\n67\n\n242. In closing for Ms Stedman, Mr Stedman belatedly adopted the\nargument regarding cladding remediation put forward by her co-lessees. Of\ncourse, Ms Stedman’s primary case runs contrary to the notion that there is\nany disrepair in the facade. However, that does not inhibit the legal protection\napplying to Ms Stedman as a matter of law if she meets the required\nconditions, and we note from the Applicants’ Skeleton Argument that they\nwere on notice that Mr Stedman would adopt the argument on his daughter’s\nbehalf [SkelA para 162].\n243. Mr Negyal, on his own behalf and that of all of the leaseholders he\nrepresented, submitted that the ordinary and natural meaning of the words\n‘cladding remediation’ should be given full effect. There is no universal\ndefinition, and Mr Wood and Dr Harris had confirmed that a curtain wall\nsystem could be cladding. The rejection emails from the BSF had not been\ndisclosed to the leaseholders, and in any event the BSF qualifications were\nmore restrictive than schedule 8 of the 2022 Act. They simply weren’t\nequivalent, and should not be construed so as to be the same. BCLP’s own\nletter of 23 December 2021 at paragraph 53 [CB 275] described the cladding\nat CPH as a ‘glazed envelope’, which matched the Applicants’ definition from\nthe Oxford Dictionary of Construction, Surveying and Civil Engineering relied\non in paragraph 172 of their Skeleton Argument. Dr Harris had also described\nthe cladding as a “weathering building envelope”. The 2006 Arup Report [Ev\n55] and Malcolm Hollis 2011 Report [Ev 344 and Ev 364] refer to the\n“cladding system” at CPH. The Proposed Scheme was, on any measure,\ncladding remediation.\n244. Mr Allison submitted that Mr Wood had conceded that a curtain\nwalling system could be a cladding system (despite his desire to distinguish\nthe term on the basis of the necessity of an ‘inner leaf’), conceded that there\nwas no necessary precondition that any such cladding improve the thermal\nquality of the facade, and accepted that there was no definition of cladding\nused universally within the construction industry. Mr Allison submitted that\nDr Harris had distinguished in his evidence between ‘rainscreen cladding’ and\nother cladding systems, but accepted that [SK024] showed a classic cross\nsection makeup of outer layer – insulation – gap – wall/blockwork that such\nother cladding systems comprise in the spandrel zone at CPH. Dr Harris had\nalso confirmed that in the past people in the construction industry had been\nless keen to identify a distinction.\n245. In [SkelD ¶31] Mr Allison drew attention to a number of references in\nthe bundle to the use of the term ‘cladding’, even by the Applicants’ own\nwitnesses. Of particular note were the 2006 Arup Report in which the facade\nwas referred to as ‘cladding’ and a ‘cladding system’ [ExB 489-490] and\n[EvB 55]. The contract sum analysis document at [EXB 611], a document to\nwhich Mr Sullivan adds his commentary but appears to have its origin with\nWT Partnership, describes at 3.03 a provision to “Remove existing cladding\nincluding to upstands”.\n246. Mr Allison’s primary contention was that the entire facade is cladding\nwithin the meaning of paragraph 8. His secondary position was that at the\n68\n\nvery least the spandrel zones were cladding. The fixed opaque glazed panels\nformed the outer wall, and part of their function was to keep out the weather.\nThey were part of the entire system. They were fixed to a horizontal timber\nframe, had a thin layer of insulation, then an air gap before the inner skin –\nthe dwarf wall being the structure of the building. If we were looking at an\nACM panel in place of the spandrel, we simply wouldn’t be having the debate.\nHe invited us to dismiss an overly-technical approach in favour of ‘stand back\nand look’. The entire system met the definitions that the Applicants had set\nout in their Skeleton Argument. Reliance on PAS 9980 and the BSF was\nincorrect – those definitions were looking purely at ‘fire risk’, and paragraph 8\nwas not so confined. Those documents did not tell us what Parliament\nintended in a different context – unsafe cladding unrelated to fire risk.\n247. In closing, Mr Hutchings KC focussed on the terminology of paragraph\n8. ‘Cladding remediation’ meant ‘removal or replacement of any part of a\ncladding system’ that ‘forms the outer wall of an external wall system’. The\ncladding system must form the outer wall of an external wall system – that\nrequires two identifiable systems. We should look at [SK024] and identify\nwhat is there and see whether what is there fits the ordinary and grammatical\nmeaning of those words.\n248. In CPH, the system in place is the external wall system – that is the\nsystem to be removed and replaced – and it is not good enough to point to one\npart of the wall. There has to be a system that is the outer layer of another\nsystem. To identify a separate part of that external wall as a ‘cladding system’\nwould strain the natural meaning of the words where what the facade is, is an\nintegral whole as close to a curtain walling system as anything else; one\ncomposite system. Both Mr Wood and Dr Harris were of the view that this is\none composite structure with no cladding system, in which the glazing is the\nexternal wall. Mr Hutchings KC referred us to the words Dr Harris used in his\nexpert report at [ExB 37 and 50] - this is a “hybrid timber-framed glazing\nsystem with screw-fixed aluminium clamp-strip to the outside which retains\nthe glazing”; “[t]he existing glazing system was not a standard design and\nrepresents a half-way house between traditional timber windows and\nmodern metal-framed curtain walling systems”. Mr Hutchings KC disputed\nthat use of ACM in the system would be relevant. Even if it was used at the\nspandrel zones, it would not render the system or those parts of it cladding.\nThe role of the spandrel panel was no more nor less than an external panel of\nthe curtain walling system. The make-up of the spandrel areas could not\nrender them a separate cladding system, they remained just a component of\nan external wall. Mr Hutchings KC referred us to [ExB 375 – 379] depicting\nthe facade modules and ladder frames. At [ExB 378] it showed that the\nglazing was fixed to the timber frame and that what resulted was an integral\nwhole, including the spandrel panels. They could not be separated out from\nthe framing section. We had to be able to distinguish a separate part if we\nwere to find that there was a separate part to which the service charge\nexemption applies. Mr Allison’s argument ignored the requirement for there\nto be an ‘external wall system’. Neither expert had referred to any part of the\nexisting system as ‘cladding’. Dr Harris had referred to ‘over-cladding’ in the\ncontext of over-cladding the existing timber framing system and sticking\nsomething else on.\n69\n\n249. Mr Hutchings KC further submitted that there was no ambiguity in the\nwording of paragraph 8. To interpret it as Mr Allison argued would\ndisincentivise landlords – if they had any concern that they would be able to\nrecover sums through the service charge, they would undertake repair in\noverzealous pursuit of their repair obligations. Mr Hutchings reminded us that\nthe Press Release relied on by Mr Allison was not a ministerial statement.\nHansard would not help us on the point. Taking a ‘stand back and look’\napproach, the Applicants were not seeking to be overly technical. Cladding\nwas meant to denote something akin to an outer panel or coating applied to a\nwall, rather than the wall itself – a skin stuck on, a cladding system plus an\nunderlying external wall. There is no second system at CPH. There is only an\nexternal wall. The danger of Mr Allison’s argument was that it sought to\nreverse engineer something to find a separate part that met the definition of\n‘cladding’ because the external wall system is unsafe.\n250. Mr Hutchings KC submitted that we could derive some assistance from\nthe documents surrounding the BSF and PAS 9980. They were not irrelevant\ndespite only dealing with fire risk. Those definitions were very close in time to\nthe 2022 Act receiving royal assent. The decision to be made was of huge\nconsequence. Was it really Parliament’s intention that the provisions of\nparagraph 8 of schedule 8 be applied to a glazing system? It was much more\nlikely that Parliament’s intention was that paragraph 8 apply to unsafe ACM\ncladding, whether identified now or in the future.\nC. Decision\n(a) Does CPH have ‘cladding’? The general question\n251. ‘Cladding’ is not defined in the Act. Neither Dr Harris nor Mr Gray was\nprepared to be drawn to a conclusion, in written or oral evidence, in respect of\nwhether the external wall system at CPH comprises (wholly or partly) cladding\nto which the 2022 Act applies, for understandable reasons – that is a decision\nfor us. Dr Harris considered that the 2022 Act had “stirred things up again”,\nand that such guidance as there is (for example, PAS 9980) is itself conflicting.\n252. Dr Harris did however make various key points in his evidence that\ntouch on the question of whether CPH might have ‘cladding’. Firstly, as set out\nabove, although Dr Harris sought to distinguish between rainscreen cladding\nand other cladding systems, he quite properly told us that what [SK024]\ndepicted was what might be termed classic cladding ‘make-up’ (our word). He\nalso confirmed that you could argue that, in parts there was an inner ‘layer’\nand an outer ‘layer’. There were parts (notably where the spandrels are)\ncomposes of internal and external timbers, and the dwarf walls could be\ndescribed as a secondary structure.\n253. We have no hesitation in accepting that there is no universally accepted\ndefinition of cladding in the construction industry, as the professionals told\nus. We consider that is perfectly appropriate - as buildings differ enormously\none to the next, there can be no ‘one size fits all’ definition. Taking CPH for\nexample, it is agreed by Dr Harris and Mr Gray, and indeed by Mr Wood, that\n70\n\nits design was experimental (and perhaps even an early pre-curser to a\nmodern curtain walling system). We are also prepared to accept the\nproposition made by all parties, absent identifiable comparables, that CPH is\nunique in its construction. Richard Seifert, the architect, was renowned for\njust that (for which he remains revered and reviled in equal measure).\n254. That explains the difficulty Mr Wood found himself in in trying to\ndistinguish what is on CPH from a ‘definition’, as the definition he has\nadopted is a narrow one that appears in PAS 9980 for the purposes of\nassessment of fire safety, rather than a ‘universal norm’. It is of note that,\nprior to making the BSF applications, he was content to make not just one but\ntwo applications on the very basis that CPH comprised cladding. We will come\nfurther to Mr Wood’s evidence in the section denoted ‘the specific question’\nbelow.\n255. Insofar as there is a starting point for a definition, the Oxford\nDictionary of Construction, Surveying and Civil Engineering’s definition of\ncladding (‘the ODC’), on which the Applicants rely, is that cladding is “the\nnon-load-bearing external envelope or skin of a building that provides\nshelter from the elements. It is designed to carry its own weight plus the\nloads imposed on it by snow, wind and during maintenance. It is most\ncommonly used in conjunction with a structural framework.”\n256. In their Skeleton Argument, the Applicants contended that cladding\n“refers to the outer skin, applied to a high-rise building, to increase thermal\nefficiency or improve aesthetics, while not adversely affecting weather\nresistance. The cladding element is not load-bearing, which means it is not\nstructurally integral to the building itself”. That is said to derive from the\nRICS Advice and Guidance Article dated 21 June 2022 contained in the\nApplicants’ authorities bundle.\n257. The RICS Guidance appears at [AAB 516]. The remainder of the\nquotation that follows is:\n“Cladding can be either retrofitted to an existing building or incorporated\ninto the design of a new building.\nWhat are the different types of cladding?\nThere are many different types of cladding systems available, ranging from\ntraditional looking brickwork or rendered systems to more modern looking\nmetallic rainscreen systems or curtain walls made from glass. Cladding\nsystems can be complicated constructions with voids, breather membranes,\ncavity barriers etc but the two main cladding materials are the thermal\ninsulation and front facade panel...\nFacade panels can be made from a wide variety of materials including wood,\nmetal, brick or vinyl, and are often made from composite materials. Two\ntypes of composite which have been highlighted in the news are ACM and\nHPL.”\n71\n\n258. The opening paragraph relied on is therefore much narrower than the\nwider description of cladding systems in the following paragraphs. It should\nnot be looked at in isolation. Mr Wood accepted that cladding does not in fact\nhave to offer increased thermal efficiency, and there are numerous cladding\nmaterials that do no such thing.\n259. We are of the view, given the evidence that we have both heard and\nseen, including the drawings [SK024] [SK025] and [SK026], and our site\nvisit, that the façade at CPH meets those definitions, both the broader ODC\nand the narrower RICS when read in light of its following paragraphs. There is\nan underlying structural framework – the concrete building. Onto that\nframework have been fixed the timber ladders, in preassembled blocks one\nstorey x 3 metres into which the glazing has been inserted. The facade has\nthen been built up, by inserting a wall or blockwork that has taken some of the\nweight of the fenestration (whether by accident or design). After that\nblockwork is a gap, an insulation panel, and spandrel inserts. Onto the glazing\nhave been screwed aluminium clamp strips, which have been over-sealed. The\nladder frame system is tied back to the concrete frame with metal ties. That\nmakes up the building ‘envelope’ at the east and west elevations. The function\nserved by the whole is to keep the elements out. The design is to transfer wind\nload to the concrete structure, not to support that concrete structure. The\ndwarf walls do not provide structural support to the building as a whole,\nthough may provide some support to the envelope. The metal ties tying back\nthe timber ladders to the concrete are also not providing structural support,\nbut do help to transfer wind-load. That design, it seems to us, is apt to meet\nthe description of cladding.\n260. That is no doubt why, at a date before the term was so imbued with\nadditional meaning because of the tragedy at Grenfell, Malcolm Hollis gave\nthis description of CPH: “The upper podium residential block is also concrete\nframed but its envelope is a curtain wall type cladding…” [EvB 350]. It is\nnot the concept of cladding that has changed, but a reluctance to use the term\nthat has.\n261. We consider that the Applicants thought the same, when twice applying\nto the BSF. The decision of the BSF does not change the nature of the thing\nthat is on the building. To the extent that anything is clear about the rejection,\nit is clear that the only cladding to which the BSF applies is ‘unsafe ACM’ as\nreferred to in the footnotes to Annex A: Technical Guidance for applicants for\nbuilding safety fund via PAS 9980:2022 [AAB 488 – 515] (‘the Technical\nGuidance’). ‘Unsafe ACM’ is not a term used by the 2022 Act, which one might\nexpect to have been used if that is what the 2022 Act meant by ‘unsafe\ncladding’, in particular given the tests carried out in 2017 resulting in an\nidentified list.\n262. We are therefore satisfied that the external façades on each of the East\nand West facing elevations are ‘cladding’ in the generic sense.\n263. However, that is not a full answer to the question, as paragraph 8 of\nschedule 8 gives its own definition of cladding. We therefore move to that\nquestion next.\n72\n\n(b) Is the cladding CPH has within the scope of the 2022 Act ? The\nspecific question\n264. We start with the words of the 2022 Act. We must first look at whether\nthe cladding at CPH ‘forms the outer wall of an external wall system’. There is\nno reference in the wording of the 2022 to a ‘skin’ ‘layer’ or ‘leaf’. Neither does\nthe 2022 Act state in terms, as argued for by the Applicants, that there must\nbe two systems. The wording of paragraph 8 does not proscribe the outer wall\nand inner wall being formed by one external wall system that is of itself\ncladding. No interpretation paragraph is provided to describe what might be\n‘inner’, ‘outer’ or ‘wall’. To that extent it is therefore unclear.\n265. No further definition is provided in the 2022 Act. The parties are\nagreed that Hansard also does not assist us on this point.\n266. We turn next to the Explanatory Notes accompanying the 2022 Act.\nNote 1747 et seq provide as follows:\n“1747. Paragraph 8 provides for protections for qualifying leaseholders from\nthe costs associated with remediating unsafe cladding by providing that no\nservice charge is payable under a qualifying lease in respect of cladding\nremediation.\n1748. Sub-paragraph (2) defines “cladding remediation”. Cladding\nremediation means the removal or replacement of unsafe cladding from the\nouter part of an external wall.”\n267. That note appears to support the above analysis of paragraph 8(2,) that\nthe cladding can be the outer part of the external wall system itself, and is not\nlimited to a separate additional wall, skin or layer fixed on the external wall\nsystem. The cladding might form part of the external wall system. If it had to\nbe a separate wall, skin or layer, that might be more prone to be described as\n“removal or replacement of unsafe cladding from the external face of an\nexternal wall”.\n268. The Applicants invite us to consider various guidance provided by the\nBSF and PAS 9980. They say that, firstly, the Technical Guidance makes clear\nthat:\n‘The building must have cladding, using the definition of cladding set out in\nthe PAS 9980:2022 guidance. (If you have buildings that have external walls\nthat comprise only masonry or concrete construction, or in which\ncombustible materials are limited to insulation within the cavity of double\nskin masonry walls you should consider whether you need to procure an\nFRAEW given that these systems will usually present an acceptable risk in\nterms of life safety)” [AAB 490].\n269. We note that does not indicate that the construction types in brackets\nare not cladding; rather that they are potentially not unsafe cladding.\n73\n\n270. The Applicants then refer to PAS 9980 and refer to the definition of\ncladding and accompanying note as follows:\n“3.1.4 system of one or more components that are attached to, and might\nform part of the weatherproof covering of, the exterior of a building\nNOTE: Such systems are normally attached to the primary structure of a\nbuilding to form non-structural, non-loadbearing external surfaces and can\ncomprise a range of facing materials/cladding panels, including metal\ncomposite panels or non-loadbearing masonry, along with insulating\nmaterials, rendered insulation systems...and insulated core sandwich panels,\nwhich are attached to the substrate. Combinations of, for example, cladding\npanels and insulation form cladding systems, and such systems might\ninclude cavities, which can be ventilated or non-ventilated. The cladding\nsystem also encompasses the supporting rails and bracketry, as applicable to\nattach the cladding to the building and cavity barriers where applicable.\nSystems that constitute the entire thickness of the external wall, by definition,\ncease to be cladding systems and are the external wall, e.g. curtain walling”\n[AAB 482].\n271. We note the use of the word ‘normally’ in that section. That must allow of\nthere being cladding to which the PAS9980 would apply even if it were\nabnormal. We note the unique construction of CPH.\n272. Moreover, straightforward as that definition and note appear initially to\nbe, we note that on page 2 of the document the following are stated to be in\nscope of the PAS 9980:\n“Wall build-ups within the scope of this PAS include, but are not limited to:\n1) external walls incorporating a rainscreen cladding system, with or\nwithout insulation within any associated cavity;\n2) external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS),\nparticularly those comprising rendered insulation;\n3) composite panels, including insulated core (“sandwich”) panels;\n4) glazed façades with infill/spandrel panels;\n5) substrates or backing walls, including concrete blockwork, brick,\nsteel framing systems (SFSs), timber framing and structural insulated\npanels (SIPs); and\n6) curtain walling.\nIt also covers attachments to the external walls of buildings” [AAB 480].\nAnd later at part 4:\n“COMMENTARY ON CLAUSE 4\n...\ne) No specific definition of an external wall was previously included in\nbuilding regulations or relevant editions of ADB, although a definition was\nintroduced when the Building Regulations 2010 were amended in 2018. The\neffect of the amendment is that all components from the wallpaper or other\n74\n\nfinish on the face of the wall internally within the building (but not including\nthe wallpaper or other finish) to the facing of the external wall on the outside\nof the building are now to be considered part of the external wall\nconstruction for the purpose of the Building Regulations. However, such a\ndefinition was not applied in any UK guidance before this time, and as a\nresult it is not uncommon to encounter combustible materials within the\nexternal wall construction, in particular the inner leaf/backing wall. Given\nthat this PAS applies to existing buildings pre-dating the 2018 amendment to\nthe Building Regulations 2010, use of this PAS assumes that remediation of\nthese inner leaf/backing walls is, in the majority of cases, unlikely to be risk-\nproportionate” [AAB 486].\n273. It would therefore appear that the composite glazed façade at CPH is\nwithin scope of PAS 9980 as it is a glazed façade with infill/spandrel panels,\nand/or has concrete blockwork backing walls with timber framing. All of the\nwords after “However, such a definition…” make it plain that there are\nconstructions in which materials may be part of the external wall that may\nnevertheless fall within a remedial category, even if such remediation is\nunlikely to be proportionate “in the majority” of those cases (again, leaving\nscope for minority outliers in which it will be proportionate). That, and the\nwords “[i]t also covers attachments to the external walls of buildings’,\nsuggesting that it might cover the external walls themselves as well as an\nattachment to them, rather undermine the earlier certainty that a system\ncomprising an external system cannot by definition be cladding. There is no\nconsistent definition in PAS 9980, and there is uncertainty created by having\nto interpret what is cladding by reference to an absence rather than a\npresence. Dr Harris’s description of the PAS 9980 and guidance as\ninconsistent perhaps relates to those paragraphs.\n274. Finally, included in the Applicants’ authorities bundle but not\nmentioned in their Skeleton Argument are the Financial Assistance\n(Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) Remediation Fund) (Private\nResidential Properties over 18m) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 [AAB\n524 – 528]. It is not known in what respect the Applicants wished to draw\nthis material to our attention. However, we note with interest that these are\nregulations applying to what might be identified as a similar fund to the BSF\nin Northern Ireland (‘the NIBSF’). The regulations make clear that the NIBSF\napplies only to ACM cladding. The NIBSF excludes from its scope unsafe non-\nACM cladding systems (regulation 5f), by which it recognises that cladding\nsystems that are unsafe for a reason other than ACM exist. Cladding system is\ndefined as follows:\n“the components that are attached to the primary structure of a building to\nform a non-structural external surface including the weather-exposed outer\nlayer or screen, fillers, insulation, membranes, brackets, cavity barriers,\nflashing, fixing, gaskets and sealants” [AAB 526].\n275. That is a definition that is clearer than the Technical Guidance, PAS\n9980, and RICS Guidance. It is not, however, the wording of the 2022 Act,\nwhich has inserted no such definition. It is itself also limited to NIBSF funding\n75\n\napplications, which are, again, concerned only with fire and the additional risk\nof its spread ACM cladding poses to the safety of residents.\n276. As this Tribunal said in Waite v Kedai Limited LON/00AY.HYI/2022\n0005 and 0016 (9 August 2023) at paragraph 66 (Judge Timothy Powell and\nMrs Helen Bowers MRICS), albeit in respect of a different regime within part\n5 (remediation orders):\nSection 1(1) of the BSA states that the Act “contains provisions intended to\nsecure the safety of people in or about buildings and to improve the standard\nof buildings.” The focus of the BSA, therefore, is on building safety and the\nimprovement of standards.\n277. As observed there (paragraph 69), while other regimes and materials\nmight inform the Tribunal’s deliberations, we are not bound or prescribed by\nthem. “We are dealing with a statutory remedy in simple terms, arising from\ncertain limited criteria being satisfied.” That observation accords with the\nprinciples of statutory interpretation and the value to be put on external\nmaterials as set out in R (O (A Minor)).\n278. Paragraph 8(2) of schedule 8 is widely drafted. It does not use\nterminology such as ‘second system’ or ‘separate skin’ or ‘leaf’, which it could\nhave done had that been Parliament’s intention. It certainly does not narrow\nthe definition so as to apply only to ACM, and again had that been\nParliament’s intention one would have expected specific reference to a\nparticular type or types of cladding. The words used are capable of supporting\na wide interpretation, to include part of an external wall system as well as a\nseparate part affixed on an external wall, and the Explanatory Notes support\nthat view. Hansard does not assist.\n279. The PAS 9980 also does not assist us in further defining the question\nof what cladding is. It is specific technical guidance in respect of fire risk\nappraisals of external walls and cladding of flats. Any definition of cladding\nwithin it is confined to that purpose. In any event it is itself unclear. We note\nthat applications to the BSF are exclusively for the purpose of remediating\nbecause of the risk to the health and safety of the occupiers of the building by\nthe spread of fire arising from a ‘relevant defect’. Such a defect falls within the\nscope of other parts of the 2022 Act. The BSF is concerned with a very\nparticular cladding arrangement that causes a fire safety risk. Paragraph 8 is\ndrafted more widely than to apply only to a danger arising from a fire safety\nrisk, and is not limited to a relevant defect. Paragraph 8 does not confine itself\nto any particular risk, contrary to the more confined ‘relevant defects’ in\nsection 120.\n280. We understand why Mr Wood has formed the view he has, based on\ninterpolating from the questions he had to answer and the rejection of the\napplications (without reasons) to the BSF, but the view that Mr Wood has\nformed in light of that experience does not conclude the issue.\n281. We return to the meaning of the words of the statute itself, and it is our\ntask and ours alone to seek to identify what those words mean and to give\n76\n\nthem effect. We are satisfied that the words ‘forms the outer wall of an\nexternal wall system’ are capable of describing the composite system identified\nby the experts as comprising the East and West “early precursor to a curtain\nwall” systems on CPH. The design was, we are told by the experts, defective\nfrom the beginning as water is allowed into hidden parts and cannot escape,\ncreating interstitial condensation. For condensation to be ‘interstitial’, by\ndefinition to it has be in an intervening space or segment, between an outer\nand inner construction. Dr Harris identified that in paragraph 3.6.2 of his\nExpert Report [ExB 51]. That accords with the RICS description of\n“complicated constructions with voids, breather membranes, cavity barriers\netc”. That also accords with the difficulties that Dr Harris has experienced in\nbeing able to identify the degree of rot and damage caused across the facades\nas a whole, and the reason why the extent of rot and damage, and\nconsequences to the structural integrity of the facade thereof, could not be\nidentified without opening up the entirety of the facade on each elevation from\nthe exterior, any interior opening up (insofar as it is possible) not allowing for\nsufficient observation of the elements.\n282. We are satisfied that finding accords with the general words of\nparagraph 8(2), and the schema of the 2022 Act. Where the system is a\ncomposite one, it seems to us that the outer part of the external wall system\nmust extend to all parts of that system. We do not agree with Mr Hutchings\nKC that such a finding would strain the meaning of paragraph 8. We are\nsatisfied that it is capable of that construction. Nor do we agree that landlords\ncarrying out such works as they are obliged to do under a lease to prevent a\ncladding system falling from a state of disrepair into a state of unsafety, in\norder to avoid the bite of paragraph 8, is an unintended consequence of that\nconstruction. Landlords being driven to address problems in a timely manner\nso that their residents’ safety is procured (and maintained) seems to us to be\nthe principal driver of the 2022 Act. Given that landlords will still have to\nconsult over major works, justifying their requirement in order to satisfy their\nleaseholders or the Tribunal that they have acted reasonably in incurring costs\nin respect of them, we do not foresee that there will be a sudden rush of\nlandlords “undertaking unnecessary works” or carrying them out too early.\n283. If, however, we are wrong in that, in the alternative we are satisfied that\nin the composite system at CPH, and in accordance with Dr Harris’s own\nevidence that the spandrel zones are what could be described as a ‘classic\ncladding make-up', then at least each spandrel zone is cladding in part of the\nbuilding, that forms the outer part of an external wall system, within the\nmeaning of the 2022 Act. The dwarf walls were built up in situ after the\nglazing panels had already been placed in their timber frames. The evidence\nwas that the external wall system was tied into the dwarf walls and in Dr\nHarris’ opinion the dwarf walls are holding some of the weight of the external\nwall system and in his opinion that was intentional. The construction then has\na gap, an insulation panel, and then a glass spandrel on a timber frame in\nfront of it. That is an external part of the external wall system. The timber\nframes and windows behind are the internal part. That is the part of the wall\nsystem that, in its costings for the Proposed Scheme in November 2021, WTP\nspecified to “Remove existing cladding, including to upstands” at an estimated\ncost of £150,000 for 1,088 square metres [ExB 1234]. It is the area that\n77\n\nClaritas estimated £141,328 for undertaking [ExB 1674], and Iconic has\nestimated at £99,008 [ExB 1766]. It is the area that the Applicants are now\nunsure what they will do about, given the uncertainty of the application of\nregulation 7 of the Building Regulations 2010 if combustible timber is retained\nbehind the new façade, and therefore unsure whether the scope of work and\ncost of it will change. Read together with the MICA Scope of Work drawings\non [EvB 1416], that clearly relates to the spandrel zones and\nconcrete/blockwork behind.\n(iii) Is the cladding that is within the scope of the 2022 Act “unsafe”?\nA. Evidence\n284. Both Dr Harris and Mr Gray agreed in their expert reports that the\nfacade at CPH had been defective from the point of construction because there\nare gaps between the pressure plates, and screw holes through them, allowing\nwater to get in (through weather or otherwise), but no drainage channels\nincorporated into the facade to allow any water that got in to drain or ventilate\nback out again. Consequently, for a period of now nearly 60 years water\ntrapped in the system has formed interstitial condensation, causing timber\nwithin the system to decay and potentially rot. The extent of the decay and rot\nis not known as the facades have not been opened-up for 100% inspection\n(which would be the only way of saying for certain how far the problem has\nextended). It is agreed by both experts that the façade is well beyond its\ndesign and service lives, which would have been in the region of 30 – 40 years.\nThe series of agreed matters was helpfully set out in their Statement of Agreed\nFacts and Disputed Issues [ExB 228].\n285. In oral evidence, Dr Harris agreed that he had serious concerns about\nthe façade generally, as evinced in his Expert Report at 1.10, 1.11 and 1.12\n[ExB 25]. Those passages set out as follows:\n“1.10 The primary façades to the west- and east-facing elevations of\nthe residential floors of Centre Point House make use of an unusual\nbespoke hybrid timber-framed glazing system with aluminium clamp\nstrips externally. The timber elements of this system have suffered\nfrom internal decay and the metal fixings which secure this system to\nthe building primary structure have been found to be suffering from\nvarious degrees of corrosion. Various frame-to-frame joints have also\nbeen found to be loose or in the process of separating. As such there\nare considerable grounds for doubt as to the structural integrity of the\nglazed facades.\n1.11 These issues are sufficiently widespread as to convince me that\nanything short of wholesale replacement or over-glazing of the\nentirety of both primary elevations would simply act to retain an\nunacceptable element of risk in those parts of the existing timber-\nframed glazing that are retained as a functional part of the glazing\nsystem.\n78\n\n1.12 I have therefore advised that in my professional opinion the\nexisting façade can no longer be relied upon to have sufficient\nstructural integrity to retain the glazing or even to remain on the\nbuilding in high winds. I also do not consider there to be a cost-\neffective and practical approach to repairing the glazing system in a\npiecemeal manner and as such have advised that the glazing system\nmust be replaced in its entirety.”\n286. Mr Allison suggested to Dr Harris that his earlier reports indicated two\nfurther concerns regarding the ways in which the glazing might not be\nretained: (1) the glazing seal material being degraded, and (2) the screws into\nthe timbers not being properly fixed. Dr Harris agreed; it was both in parts.\nThe screws were fixing the clamp strips into timber that they now knew to be\ndecaying and therefore might not hold. If they failed, the glass was effectively\n‘glued’ with an unknown glazing compound of unidentified residual\neffectiveness. If both failed, it would be sufficient for the glass to be pulled out\nof the façade. He clarified that when he was talking about the glazing\ncompound, it was that applied in 2010 to seal the façade from water, rather\nthan the adhesion behind the glass he was referring to.\n287. Dr Harris made it clear that in windy weather, he was particularly\nconcerned that the glazing would in effect be ‘sucked out’ from the façade due\nto the forces operating around the building. There was always some point on\nthe building where the wind would be pushing or pulling, and of course some\nareas – especially the corners of the building – were more at risk. The\nspandrels were ordinary annealed glass and, whether a pane fell to the ground\nor even just broke in situ, would break into large and sharp pieces with\npotential dreadful consequences, whether for the leaseholders or members of\nthe public using the public square below. Dr Harris also agreed with Mr\nAllison that in high winds the façade as a whole might fail; an entire part of\nthe system might be dislodged. Dr Harris identified that the façade appeared\nto have been pre-assembled in 1 storey x 3 metre units. There was potential for\none of those units to fail, whether wholly or partially. If it did, the failure of the\npart would increase the load across other parts of the façade, which would lead\nto a progressive failure. If one went, others could follow soon after. Mr Allison\nasked whether it would require abnormally strong winds. Dr Harris indicated\nthat the experts could not be satisfied what the as-designed wind load capacity\nof the façade was. Even supposing it was 50mph, he could not be satisfied\nwhat the load-bearing capacity of the façade in its current state is. He’d be\nvery worried if anyone was expecting the façade to stand up to its as-designed\nwind load capacity. He could not know the residual strength of every part of\nthe façade. In the recent storms, he spent his nights sleeplessly half-expecting\na ‘phone call to alert him’ of something along the above lines. Some areas were\npotentially a high risk, especially the corners. That had probably been the case\nsince at least 2009 when the Rambol WhitbyBird report was done. His main\nconcern was not the internal timbers – they were not too bad, despite the\ninterstitial condensation problems – but the external ones. By 2018 the fixings\nwere more concerning. Rambol WhitbyBird did not seem to have looked at\nthose fixings.\n79\n\n288. Dr Harris agreed with Mr Allison that it was only luck that, six and a\nhalf years after the 2017 Report, so far only one window had fallen out,\nalthough he took some comfort from the large opening windows having finally\nbeen screwed down or secured since the 2019 incident. If there was the type of\nstorm event that occurs once in every 150 years or so, he’d be extremely\nnervous, but he knew it would be unlikely to happen imminently. He was\ngrateful that the current application was finally underway. He agreed he was\nconcerned that the façade would not make it into next winter – indeed he was,\nas he had said, worried even about the recent types of storm that London\nexperienced in January. He is on the cusp, he told us, of saying to the\nApplicants that enough is enough, the entire building has to be scaffolded.\nThis could not go on for another 2 years. He did not have confidence the\nfaçade would last a further year.\n289. In re-examination, Mr Hutchings KC endeavoured to take Dr Harris\nthrough the individual elements within the red-hatched area that were to be\nremoved. Dr Harris was specifically asked to identify whether those individual\nparts were ones that were unsafe in his view. Dr Harris ‘s answers in response\nwere generally framed in terms of parts ‘having to go’ to make room for the\nProposed Scheme. He did not, on each and every item put to him, say that it\nwas or was not unsafe, despite our reminder to him to do so. He confirmed in\nthe course of the itemised lists put to him that the pressure plates were not\nunsafe in themselves, and nor was the one-inch polystyrene, which would be\nreplaced with firestopping. The glass in the fixed window frames was not\nunsafe, it was to be removed because there was to be new glass in front.\n290. His evidence was that the spandrels would come out. He did not\ncomment in re-examination on whether they were or were not unsafe. He did\nsay that the timber mullions on the spandrels would come out because they\nwere easier to cut out, not specifically because they were unsafe. The timber\nnosings would be cut back to make more space for the new system.\nB. Argument\n291. Mr Negyal described the offence the leaseholders took, for the reasons\nhe gave us and which we wholly understand, to the inference they drew from\nthe Applicants’ Skeleton Argument that leaseholders were wrongly trying to\ntake advantage of the Grenfell tragedy. We should say that we doubt that the\nApplicants intended to imply anything personal in their arguments, and we\nthink it is probably a feature of the total breakdown in the relationship\nbetween the Applicants and leaseholders that all interactions feel more\npersonal than professional on both sides. I observe (from personal experience,\nand, occasionally, practice) that lawyers rarely intend a legal argument to be a\npersonal attack, and on those rare occasions they do their language is often in\nthe superlative and any such ‘attack’ readily identifiable as such. I thank Mr\nNegyal for the reminder, good for all of us, that language matters, and that\neven when faced with difficult legal challenges that we must resolve\nobjectively, one never knows where that objective principle might engage with\nsomeone’s subjective experience.\n80\n\n292. Mr Negyal submitted that the legislation was drafted widely and\ninclusively precisely to avoid danger to leaseholders from unsafe cladding,\nplain and simple - to protect leaseholders from corporate bodies who are not\nsafety minded. The cladding on CPH is unsafe in two ways: the glazing, which\non the Applicants’ own case is so unsafe it is now falling from the building;\nand the rotting 1 storey x 3m panels, about both of which Dr Harris expressed\nhis continuing significant concerns to us.\n293. Mr Allison submitted that Dr Harris had been clear that the existing\nfacade is unsafe and poses an ongoing threat to the leaseholders and public\nusing the square, and has been warning of the urgent need for works on the\ngrounds of safety for some time. The reason that it is unsafe is that it was\ninherently defective. There was no question of avoiding that result by regular\nmaintenance. The only way to maintain the inherently defective facade was to\nreplace it. Mr Hutchings KC’s ‘bit by bit’ examination of Dr Harris was\npredicated on an argument that ran along the lines of ‘it doesn’t matter if the\nwhole is unsafe, if the individual bits aren’t intrinsically so’. That could not be\nthe correct approach. It is the system, or part of the system, that needs to be\nunsafe. Nor could reliance on a definition from the BSF or PAS 9980 dictate\nwhat ‘unsafe’ means for paragraph 8. Those definitions were for a fire risk\nassessment and nothing else. Those definitions could not assist us with what\nParliament intended by paragraph 8 in a different context.\n294. In closing, Mr Hutchings KC submitted that in order to be caught\nwithin the provision, the thing or part to be removed and/or replaced within\nthe cladding system had to be, itself, unsafe. No individual piece or part of the\nfaçade is unsafe.\nC. Decision\n295. ‘Unsafe’ is not defined in the 2022 Act. It must mean something more\nthan simply out of repair. It is sufficiently wide a term to encompass a range of\nthreats to the safety of the building or to its residents or nearby members of\nthe public. That is a plain and straightforward interpretation of the language\nused and no external sources are needed for it. It is consistent with the wide\ndrafting of the 2022 Act and its stated purposes.\n296. The definition of ‘unsafe’ for the purposes of the BSF [AAB 500]\nfound in the Technical Guidance makes clear that definition applies only to\nACM cladding, and is concerned with combustibility. Paragraph 8 of schedule\n8 is not confined to any particular kind of cladding, or danger. Parliament\ncould have confined the paragraph but did not. It must be supposed to have\nmade a deliberate choice in that regard. Paragraph 8 is therefore to be widely\nconstrued.\n297. It requires a feat of mental gymnastics, in an application brought\nbecause the Applicants are concerned that the facade is unsafe and needs\nwholesale replacement, to permit them then to lean on the piece-by-piece\ninterpretation and conclude that because no isolated element of the façade is\nunsafe, paragraph 8 of schedule 8 does not apply, so the leaseholders must\npay. As the Applicants’ witnesses, Mr Waite and Mr Evans, stated in evidence,\n81\n\nthe primary motivation behind the section 27A(3) application is they are\nconcerned about the safety of the façade and the dangers it poses to the\nleaseholders and to the public.\n298. To use Mr Hutchings KC’s words when he sought to persuade us that\nthe facade on CPH is not a cladding system, “this is a complete system in its\nown right”. It is, as the experts said, a composite system. Dr Harris’s clear\nevidence was that the entire facade is unsafe, indeed he has sleepless nights\nover it. Mr Evans told us that he also has sleepless nights over it.\n299. We are satisfied that it would be inappropriate to break-out all of the\nindividual elements comprised in the cladding system (whether, as we have\nfound, the whole of the facade, or the smaller parts at the spandrel zones) and\nconclude that because element by isolated element they are not unsafe, the\ncladding system is not unsafe. The use of the term ‘unsafe cladding system’ in\nparagraph 8 must be apt to describe not the individual elements, but the\nsystem they make up. Its construction is as important an element as the\nindividual parts. It would not matter if a timber frame is not itself unsafe, if it\nis constructed without (for example) screws or mullions, so that it would blow\nover with one heave from the big bad wolf. In the same way, it does not matter\nthat ACM cladding is not unsafe until it meets with a source of ignition. In\nboth cases, the reason the particular cladding system is unsafe is because of\nthe operation of some other force on its parts. In this case, that other force is\nwater leading to the decay and rot in the façade and/or the pressure of the\nwind that could cause the parts of the system to dislodge and fall.\n300. On the basis of the very clear evidence from Dr Harris as to the serious\ndegradation of the condition of the façade including the serious risk to the\nhealth and safety of the residents and the public if more of the windows\ndetached because of the detachment of the clamp strip and failure of screws\n(or indeed one of the annealed (i.e. not safety) glass spandrel panels was to be\nsucked out by wind force) due to degradation in the timbers or failure of\nexternal seals due to the water being let and kept in, we are satisfied that the\ncladding system at CPH is unsafe.\n(iv) If the Proposed Scheme is (wholly or partly) remediation of unsafe\ncladding within the meaning of the 2022 Act, what is the effect on whether the\nservice charges are payable by leaseholders with Qualifying Leases?\n301. In light of the above analysis, we are satisfied that the provisions of\nparagraph 8 of schedule 8 of the 2022 Act apply to the identified qualifying\nleaseholders and to CPH, that CPH has cladding, that the cladding system falls\nwithin the ambit of paragraph 8(2)(a) of the Act whether as a system entire or\nfor those composite parts of the system that make up identifiable clad ‘parts’,\nand that that system is unsafe.\n302. It follows that no service charge is payable by those with Qualifying\nLeases in respect of the Proposed Scheme. We do not consider that it matters\nwhich conclusion is the correct alternative (in terms of whether the whole of\nthe cladding at CPH is within paragraph 8(2), or whether only the external\nidentified separate clad parts of the cladding system – i.e. the spandrel zones\n82\n\ndo). The agreed expert evidence before us is that the only practical way to\nremediate is to ‘over-clad’ the entire façade on each elevation. There is no\nsmaller divisible ‘part’ of the scheme put forward by the Applicant that might\nrelate only to clad areas if those areas are less than the whole, or a lesser\nscheme than the Proposed Scheme. To fix those clad parts, the whole façade\nneeds to be replaced. ‘Remediation’ is a term as wide as it is possible to be - no\ndoubt a deliberate choice by Parliament to ensure that the provision was\noutcome- rather than remedy-focussed - and in our view includes replacement\nwhether by over-cladding or otherwise. Therefore, the Proposed Scheme\nwould fall within the definition of ‘cladding remediation’ for which the\nleaseholders of qualifying flats should not pay by virtue of paragraph 8 of the\nAct.\n303. In the alternative in relation to the alternative finding that only parts of\nthe façade are a ‘cladding system’ within the terms of paragraph 8, paragraph\n10(2) of schedule 8 of the Act (said to supplement paragraph 8 but being more\ninterpretative than additional) states as follows:\n10\n(2) Where a relevant paragraph provides that no service charge is payable\nunder a lease in respect of a thing –\n(a) no costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of that thing (or in\nrespect of that thing and anything else)\n(i) are to be regarded for the purposes of the relevant\nprovisions as relevant costs to be taken into account in\ndetermining the amount of service charge payable under\nthe lease, or\n(ii) are to be met from a relevant reserve fund…\n304. The Proposed Scheme is either completely in pursuit of cladding\nremediation and therefore is ‘that thing’, or is partly in pursuit of cladding\nremediation. Is that other part therefore ‘anything else’?\n305. That term is as wide as possible. No assistance can be derived from\neither the Explanatory Notes of Hansard in that regard, but what else could\n‘anything else’ refer to but parts of the self-same works that encompass parts\nthat are ‘the thing’ and parts that are ‘another thing’?\n306. If it is partly in pursuit of cladding remediation, and any other part of\nthe Proposed Scheme is not in pursuit cladding remediation but is in pursuit\nof façade remediation of the same structure of which there is no identifiable\ndivisible set of works that can be done to achieve remediation of the cladding,\nwe consider that other part is something apt to be described as ‘anything else’.\nIn our view, ‘the thing’ and the ‘other thing’ must have a nexus and be in the\npursuit of an outcome that relates to the cladding.\n307. That might be to add a gloss to the words used by the statute. We do so\nintentionally. A wider interpretation, that would nevertheless be supportable\non the natural meaning of the words used, would potentially lead to absurdity\nin the case of unrelated works. If the purpose of paragraph 8 is to ensure that\nleaseholders do not pay for the remediation of unsafe cladding, the provision\n83\n\nof the protection in relation to ‘anything else’ must be to ensure that the\nprotection applies to the whole of the works that will achieve remediation of\nthe unsafe cladding, whether or not they also form part of a more extensive\nscheme of works as part of which the remediation of the cladding will be\nachieved. It is not to protect leaseholders from costs that are not related. For\nexample, no-one would say that a leaseholder should not pay for garden re-\nwalling works simply because the same contractors were carrying out cladding\nremediation to a building as part of the same contract.\n308. In this case there is no other element of the Proposed Scheme that is\nnot in pursuit of the remediation of the façade that has been left to get into an\nunsafe state. The nexus in this case is the façade remediation, which\ncomprises cladding remediation. The outcome will be a remediated façade\nwith no unsafe cladding (and which is put into a condition to meet the\nApplicants’ obligations under the lease by being overclad).\n309. Therefore, it is our view that whether as a consequence of our primary\nfinding, or (if we are wrong in that) our secondary finding, nothing falls to be\npaid by the flats 5, 11, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34 and 35.\n(v) Is the QLTA ‘cladding remediation’ within paragraph 8, and/or is it\ncaptured by paragraph 10(2) of schedule 8 of the 2022 Act?\n310. After the hearing, and while drafting this decision, we identified an\nadditional issue regarding the QLTA that had not been raised by any of the\nRespondents. No party at the hearing, or in their pleadings, suggested that the\nQLTA fell within paragraph 8 or paragraph 10(2).\n311. On 14 February 2024, I wrote to the parties regarding an issue that we\nidentified in the course of preparing this decision. I identified that issue as\nfollows:\nIf the Tribunal were to find that (i) there is cladding at CPH, and (ii) the\nwhole or part of that cladding is within the meaning of paragraph 8 of\nSchedule 8 of the Building Safety Act 2022, such that no service charge is\npayable for its remediation, it is the Tribunal's preliminary view that\nparagraph 10(2)(a) of schedule 8 would apply to the Proposed Scheme and\nwould also apply to the QLTA, on the basis that the QLTA is 'and anything\nelse' within the meaning of that paragraph. No Respondent has made this\nargument, and therefore the Applicant has not had the opportunity to\naddress us on it. The Tribunal therefore invites the Applicant's arguments…”\n312. On 7 March 2024, the Applicants replied. In that reply, the Applicants\nconceded that, if the Tribunal determined that the whole of the façade at CPH\nwas unsafe cladding requiring remediation within the meaning of paragraph 8\nof schedule 8, either the term ‘remediation’ within paragraph 8 was capable of\nencompassing the QLTA, or, if ‘remediation’ was to be narrowly construed, the\nsupplemental description of that “thing and anything else” was. Either\nconstruction would result in no costs being payable for the QLTA. We agree\nand so find.\n84\n\n313. The Applicants took the view that if only part of the system is cladding,\nthe position is different. The contents of the reply were as follows:\n(1) The costs under the QLTA relate to the management of a larger\nproject, only part of which includes “cladding remediation”;\n(2) Those costs are not “service charge… in respect of cladding\nremediation” - they are costs in respect of the [Proposed] Works,\nwhich includes cladding remediation and other works in respect of\nwhich service charge is recoverable. On the first construction set out\nabove, paragraph 8 of Schedule 8 to the BSA 2022 would not\npreclude recovery.\n(3) Turning then to paragraph 10(2), that paragraph could in principle\nprevent recovery of costs incurred under the QLTA which could be\nsaid to relate to the “cladding remediation” and thus give rise to\nrelevant costs in connection with that “cladding remediation”, on the\nbasis that those costs are “in respect of that thing or anything else”\n(see the second construction above). However, quite how the\nTribunal could make such a finding in this case, based on the\nevidence before it, is difficult to see (not least because that was not\nthe Respondents’ case) and so there is no evidence that the part of\nthe costs under the QLTA relate to the “cladding remediation”\nelement of the Works, if the Tribunal were to make such a finding.\nThe QLTA is for a project manager of the Works which, in these\ncircumstances, would involve works other than “cladding\nremediation”.\n(4) There is no injustice caused by choosing not to find that paragraph\n10(2) prevents recovery of a particular part of the QLTA costs, since\nit would be open to the Respondents to mount a reasonableness\nchallenge, in so far as they could prove the costs under the QLTA\nrelate to cladding remediation.\n314. We invited submissions from the Respondents on those last paragraphs\nonly if they considered it desirable, and they were duly filed by Mr Allison for\nMr Doran, Mr Negyal for the leaseholders he represents, and Mr Weeks for his\nmother.\n315. In short, we disagree with the Applicants’ interpretation. Firstly, we\nhave not be provided with the QLTA proposed contract, but the Proposed\nScheme is entirely in pursuit of the installation of the Raico cladding system.\nThe Applicants’ argument before us was predicated on there being no cladding\nat CPH at all. There is no separate and divisible part of either the Proposed\nScheme or QLTA that the Applicant puts forward that could be only in respect\nof cladding remediation at the spandrel zones. It is a single system designed to\nremediate the entirety of the façade. It is perhaps surprising that the\nApplicants took an all-or-nothing approach, without acknowledging the\nmaterial from its own clients specifying for cladding removal [ExB 1234] and\nMICA’s drawings showing cladding to upstands [EvB 1416], but that was the\nApplicants’ litigation choice to make.\n85\n\n316. While, if CPH is only clad in part, there would therefore be a ‘larger\nproject’ because the Proposed Scheme is the (now accepted) only remedial\noption, as we have found above, any part of the ‘larger project’ is nevertheless\ncaught by paragraph 10(2) because of the nexus between the works and the\nimpossibility of breaking them out into a smaller remedial scheme. Any works\nover-and-above cladding remediation might well be works ‘other than’\ncladding remediation, but would be on that basis “anything else” because they\nwould be the self-same scheme that pursues an outcome that relates to the\nremediation of cladding.\n317. The same reasoning applies to the QLTA. It would be artificial to suggest that,\nbecause the Proposed Scheme will be located over some parts that are clad\nand others that are not, there is any way in which the QLTA for the delivery of\nthat scheme can be broken out into smaller parcels. The Applicants do not\nidentify how that might be done. Even if it they could, as Mr Allison rightly\nsays, paragraph 10(2) is inclusive not exclusive – it seeks to extend the\nprotections of paragraph 8 to “anything else” related to it, with which it has a\nnexus (as we have found). It does not say ‘the thing and nothing else’, as it\nwould need to do to bear the Applicants’ interpretation. To read it in those\nterms would be the direct opposite of the words on the page.\n318. It seems to us that paragraph 10(2)(a) - “in respect of that thing and\nanything else”- is also therefore apt to describe the QLTA in respect of which\nthe Applicants also seek a determination under section 27A(3) of the 1985 Act.\nThe Proposed Scheme is the cause of the need for the project manager whose\nposition is the subject of the QLTA – without the Proposed Scheme, no project\nmanager would be necessary. There is no divisible set of works that can be\nascribed to only the clad areas – the entire system is the ‘thing’ that\nremediates the cladding (it is not simply a question of saying ‘the scope of\nworks allows this much for it to be removed’, as that takes no account of the\nend goal – the remediation). We have not seen the proposed contract for the\nQLTA, but it seems to us that there would be no divisible part of it for similar\nreasons.\n(5) Part Two Conclusion\n319. As a result of the above analysis of paragraphs 8 and 10(2) of schedule\n8, for the purposes of section 27A(3)(a), the leaseholders of only those flats\nthat do not have qualifying leases would be liable for payment of the costs of\nthe Proposed Scheme and the QLTA, those being Flats 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14,\n16, 23, 24, 26, and 30.\nPART THREE\n(6) The Set-Off issue\nA. The preliminary issue\n320. We raised with the parties at the outset of the hearing, and in light of\nthe Applicants’ election of the ‘amount’ point under section 27A(3)(c), our\ndiscomfort with deciding a question of set-off when we:\n86\n\n(a) weren’t able to decide a sum that would be payable in the future against\nwhich to set anything off,\n(b) could not know the full scope, in terms even of an end date, of any such\nset-off that existed or might subsist until the works have been undertaken,\n(c) could not be satisfied that any such set off that might exist or subsist until\nthe works have been completed would encompass any additional set off of a\ndifferent nature that might arise, such that the resolution of the issue now\nmight be artificial, and\n(d) could not therefore be in any position to decide the quantum of that sum.\n321. We wondered whether we might consider what we identified as the\nliability question. Mr Allison reminded us that our jurisdiction derived from\nsection 27A(3). Insofar as set-off fell to be considered under that question, it\nmust be a question of the sum to be paid. It would be unsafe to proceed into\nthe liability question when we were not considering the sum to be paid. We\nhad no jurisdiction to approach section 27A(3) in that way. He referred us to\nthe decision of Chamber President Judge Siobhan McGrath, Regional Judge\nTim Powell and Mrs Bowers (LON/00BJ/LSC/2018/0286 18 December 2019)\nin which the panel identified the following approach:\n30. The purpose of an application under section 27A is to ask the Tribunal to\ndecide the amount of costs payable by a tenant. Although an application can\nbe made in relation to a service charge fund payable by a group of\nleaseholders, it must be possible at the end of the application to be able to\nascertain how much each leaseholder will pay by dividing the total amount\nof the service charge costs by each tenant’s individual service charge\npercentage.\n31. For applications under section 27A(3) it is possible for a Tribunal to make\na partial or conditional determination. For example, if the Tribunal is\nsatisfied that the specified works fall under the lease clauses and that it\nwould be reasonable to incur the costs, they can decide that service charges\nwould be payable but that the actual cost payable might be assessed again\nfor reasonableness when the works are carried out or the services are\nprovided.\n322. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Hutchings KC sought to persuade us\nthat section 27A(3)(e) of the 1985 Act, when it referred to ‘manner’ in which\nany sum in section 27A(3)(c) ‘would be payable’, related not just to quantum\nbut also to the liability question in a set off argument. Aviva Investors Ground\nRent GP Ltd & Anor v Williams & Ors [2023] UKSC 6 (SC) supported that\ninterpretation in paragraph 12, in which Lord Briggs (giving the judgment\nwith which their Lordships agreed) stated: “…section 27A provides for a\ngenerously worded jurisdiction of the FtT to determine whether a service\ncharge is payable (section 27A(1)) or would be payable if specified costs were\nincurred (section 27A(3)). Although there is detail about payability in terms\nof payer, payee, amount, timing and payment method… nothing is said\nexpressly about the principles the FTT is to apply in determining payability”\n[DAB 57].\n87\n\n323. We expressed discomfort with Mr Hutchings KC’s interpretation, as it\nseemed to us section 27A(3)(e) was concerned with a method of payment of an\nidentified sum, which is properly a principle of quantum rather than liability.\nOne has to obtain the sum before one looks at method of payment. Set-off\nwould operate to reduce the sum, before the question of payment arose. We\nindicated that, even were we to be persuaded by his argument and embark on\nthe ‘liability’ question in relation to any such set-off, we were of the view that\nthe questions of liability and quantum were more properly dealt with together.\nWe were concerned that to decide the question of liability absent an\nascertainable sum on either side would be to decide half a question in\nsomething of a vacuum, potentially setting an appeal running, in\ncircumstances where it might be that if the liability and quantum were heard\ntogether success on the liability point did not necessarily lead to an\nassessment of the quantum in more than nominal damages, if there have been\nno contributions to the reserves and Mr Allison’s quantum argument is\nunsuccessful.\n324. Nevertheless, at the outset of the hearing, we agreed that we would\nneed to make a fully reasoned decision on the jurisdiction question, and it\nwould therefore be appropriate that we leave open the possibility that Mr\nHutchings KC might be able to persuade us in closing that that the ‘liability\nonly’ approach remained open to us.\n325. We therefore heard considerable evidence and argument on the set-off\n‘liability’ points, that we do not set out here for the reasons given below.\nB. Argument\n326. By the end of the hearing, the Applicants’ position was that they no\nlonger wished us to decide any element of the set-off arguments.\n327. Nevertheless, Mr Negyal and Mr Weeks were keen that we should\ndecide the set-off issue even if only on a liability basis. We therefore invited\nMr Hutchings KC to make the argument he had earlier indicated, that he said\nsupported the fact that we had jurisdiction to make such a decision.\n328. The Applicants’ argument as we understood it is that a set off is,\nproperly construed, ‘payment’ by reducing a debt or damages on one party’s\npart by ‘paying it off’ by a co-extensive or lesser sum of debt or damages on the\nsecond party’s part. ‘Manner’ is apt to describe the process by which a thing is\ndone or happens. There is nothing unnatural or absurd in construing section\n27A(3)(e) to include set off as a manner of payment. Relying on paragraph 12\nof Aviva, a determination on the question of the manner of payment is within\nour jurisdiction to make in this application, even absent a sum, as it is not the\nsum that is important but the means by which, when it is ascertained, it will be\npaid.\nC. Decision\n329. Lord Briggs goes further in Aviva. It should be noted that what the\nSupreme Court was seized with was consideration of the effect of 27A(6) of the\n88\n\n1985 Act. However, in the passage below, Lord Briggs looked at the\noverarching jurisdiction in relation to prospective service charges:\n14. Generally speaking, the making of a demand upon a tenant for payment\nof a service charge in a particular year will have required the landlord first\nto have made a number of discretionary management decisions. They will\ninclude what works to carry out or services to perform, with whom to\ncontract for their provision and at what price, and how to apportion the\naggregate costs among the tenants benefited by the works or services. To\nsome extent the answers to those questions may be prescribed in the relevant\nleases, for example by way of a covenant by the landlord to provide a list of\nspecified services, or by a fixed apportionment regime. But even the most\nrigid and detailed contractual regime is likely to leave important decisions to\nthe discretion of the landlord, such as whether merely to repair or wholly to\nreplace a defective roof over the building, with major consequences in terms\nof that year’s service charge.\n…\n16. On an application under section 27A(3) in relation to a prospective\nservice charge the FtT might well be invited to exercise its jurisdiction before\nthe landlord made the relevant discretionary management decisions, but the\njurisdiction would not thereby be enlarged from that described above merely\nbecause of the timing. … the FtT would still be limited to ruling upon the\ncontractual and statutory legitimacy of the landlord’s proposal, coupled with\na Braganza rationality review if necessary, which is really an aspect of the\ntesting of contractual legitimacy. And the landlord would have to furnish the\nFtT with a sufficiently detailed plan of its proposals (including the relevant\ndiscretionary management decisions) to enable the FtT to rule prospectively\nupon the lawfulness of the service charge demand if the proposed works\nwere carried out: see Kensington and Chelsea Royal London Borough Council\nv Lessees of 1—124 Pond House [2016] L&TR 10 [2015] UKUT 395, paras\n66—67.”\n330. In Various Properties at St George Wharf and Battersea Reach\n(LON/00AY/LSC/2019/0330 & 038 and LON/00BJ/LSC/2019/0330) Judge\nMcGrath, Mr Holdsworth, and Judge Chris McNall (Tax Chamber) had cause\nto consider those words. At paragraph 46 of its decision on 9 June 2023, the\nTribunal said this:\n47. Accordingly, before the Tribunal can consider whether costs have been or\nwill be reasonably incurred, it must first be satisfied that its jurisdiction is\nproperly engaged. In other words, does section 27A permit the Tribunal to\nresolve the issues that the applicant has brought before it? In Kensington and\nChelsea Royal London Borough Council v Lessees of 1—124 Pond House\n[2015] UKUT 395, the council sought a determination that they had complied\nwith the consultation requirements under section 20 of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985. However, because the Tribunal cannot give mere\ndeclaratory relief, an application was made under section 27A(3) for a\ndetermination that, if costs were incurred, they would be payable. In effect,\nthis was a device to engage the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal made\n89\n\nthe determinations sought, but only on the basis that a specific description of\nthe works to be carried out to each of the many properties concerned was\navailable. Putting it another way, the Tribunal would not have had\njurisdiction if the ambit of the works had not been described and if there had\nbeen insufficient information for the Tribunal to consider that it would in due\ncourse be able to make a determination about payability.\nJurisdiction and Prima Facie Case\n48. In our view the same considerations apply to section 27A(1). Before the\nTribunal can decide an application under either section 27A(1) or (3) it must\nbe satisfied that the question before it engages issues of payability under\nsection 18 of the 1985 Act relating to the contractual or statutory legitimacy\nof the service charge costs. It may not (per Williams v Aviva) make\ndeclarations solely about a landlord’s management decisions. A tribunal will\nneed to be satisfied that an application by either a landlord or a lessee gives\nsufficient information for the Tribunal to consider that it would in due course\nbe able to make a determination about payability.\n331. The section 27A(3) decision we have before us is narrow, in terms of\nthe scope of that section. We do not know, and are no longer invited to make a\nfinding on, what the cost of the Proposed Scheme will be, though we will be\nable to determine its payability in due course if required to do so. The question\nwe are engaged with is no wider than the very first part of the question as\nidentified by Lord Briggs in Aviva: “the contractual and statutory legitimacy of\nthe landlord’s proposal, coupled with a Braganza rationality review if\nnecessary, which is really an aspect of the testing of contractual legitimacy”.\n332. The issue of payability with which this application is concerned is,\nrealistically, no wider than ‘if we did these works would the law and the lease\nallow us to recover the sums from the leaseholders in principle’. The\nApplicants have accepted that we cannot make a determination as to the sum\nthat would be payable for the Proposed Scheme in the future, for the reasons\nalready outlined. The Applicants have not made any application, as they could\nhave done, in respect of the payability of the reserve fund demands. The sum\nof those demands may not end up being the cost of the Proposed Scheme, as\nwe do not know at this stage what that scheme will cost. In due course, if the\nparties do not resolve the issues between them, there may well be the necessity\nof a section 27A(1) application to engage the section 19 question of\nreasonableness as it relates to payability. No-one could suggest that, because\nthis application has been determined on the narrow question of payability\nwhich it is engaged by the application, a future application on the question of\nreasonableness would be res judicata. When the costs of the Proposed Scheme\nthat are in principle recoverable in law and by the lease are known, it may\nbecome our task to determine issues of payability by reference to\nreasonableness, but that is not something we are able to do within the ambit\nof this application.\n333. We therefore consider that Lord Briggs, when he elided ‘manner of\npayment’ with ‘method of payment’ in paragraph 12 of Aviva, was giving\nproper effect to the provisions of section 27A(3)(e). We do not agree, as the\nApplicants appeared to suggest, that Lord Briggs had not had what ‘manner’\n90\n\nmeant in the context of the statutory provision in the foremost of his mind\nwhen considering the question.\n334. To construe the word ‘manner’ as wider than ‘method’ so as to result in\nset-off being a ‘manner of payment’ would, we are satisfied, lead to absurdity.\nIf the Applicants’ construction of the provision is correct, if a landlord were to\nmake a demand, in order to satisfy that demand a tenant need do no more\nthan simply assert an equitable set off (be it never so vague) with the result\nthat the debt will have been ‘paid’. No landlord would consider that the\ndemand had been paid in those circumstances. If that asserted set-off was\npayment, the landlord could not bring a debt claim on the demand. It would\nnot know how much if anything had been ‘paid’. The cart would be before the\nproverbial horse.\n335. We are satisfied that sections 27A(3)(c)-(e) are all questions of the\npractical method of payment, once the liability of the leaseholders for a sum in\nservices charges for recoverable works has been established. Who would pay,\nto whom, and in what sum must be established first. (d) follows (c), in that no\ndate for payment can be set unless there is first an amount. (e) also follows (c),\nin that no manner of payment can be identified for an\nunascertained/unascertainable sum. Giving the words used their natural\nmeaning, part of the identification of the appropriate manner of payment\nmust depend on the sum involved. Manner is wide enough to include, for\nexample, whether payment might be made by instalments, but that is still a\nquestion of method – the practical way in which an identifiable sum of money\nwill move from one party to the other. We therefore find that section\n27A(3)(e) is not wide enough to bring within its scope the ‘liability question’ in\nrespect of set-off.\n(7) Part Three conclusion\n336. We realise that will be a disappointment to the leaseholders who assert\ntheir set-off, although given our decision in respect of paragraph 8 of schedule\n8 of the 2022 Act we note that in approximately half those asserting set-off\nwill no longer need to fall back on it. We are only able to make decisions in\nrespect of which we have jurisdiction from the application we have been\nrequired to consider.\n(f) Our conclusions\n337. In the circumstances, and for the reasons given, we conclude that if\ncosts were incurred in respect of the Proposed Scheme and QLTA, those costs\nwould be recoverable from the leaseholders of Flats 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16,\n23, 24, 26, and 30.\n338. If it is necessary to do so because in due course an application under\nsection 27A(1) is made, we will consider the set off arguments on that\noccasion.\n339. We note that the leaseholders have found this process frustrating and\nexhausting, as well as expensive. It appears to us that they have not been\n91\n\nassisted by those who put themselves in a position to do so to resolve their\nmisunderstandings in the past. We hope that, with this decision, they might\nunderstand that (contrary to the impression it seems they were given) the\nApplicants have not been working against them all this time. We do\nunderstand the sums of money that they are being asked to pay are very\nsubstantial, and we also understand that giving someone else the control over\ndecisions to be made over the use of those substantial sums of money is\nextremely difficult. We ask them to remember that, even if what they would\nprefer is something else, the Applicants will usually have a range of reasonable\noptions open to them, and not every option will suit every individual’s needs.\n340. We note that, sadly, this decision goes no further than a statement of\nthe rights and obligations already existing in the leases, and use of which the\nApplicants could, and should, have made use of prior to this. In that sense, it\nrepresents no progress for the Applicants, who still have decisions to make\nand difficulties to overcome.\n341. We note that this is both Almacantar’s and Mr Waite’s first\ndevelopment with any significant element of residential occupation. That may\nwell explain Mr Waite’s firm misunderstanding that the Proposed Scheme\ncould not be carried out without unanimous consent, about which he was\nadamant.\n342. That is simply not the case. Management of residential property\nrequires difficult decisions, often in the teeth of opposition. If unanimous\nconsent were always required, residential leasehold management across the\ncountry would be at a standstill, and the Tribunal would be inundated.\n343. Mr Evans was more circumspect in telling us what he thought the\nApplicants’ rights pursuant to the lease are. He told us that he would “always\ntry to achieve consent where possible”. That is admirable, but it is essential to\nrecognise that it is not always achievable. Consent is not itself the end goal.\nEnsuring the Applicants’ adherence to its repairing covenants must be\nprioritised, especially where the leaseholders (and public) are endangered by\ndelay to obtain unanimous consent.\n344. Those decisions may well come with their own difficulties, but at least\nthey would have progressed the works that have been required for a very long\ntime. It may well have been that, if bolder decisions had been made, the\nconsequences of the 2022 Act could have been avoided. Delay is therefore a\n‘double-whammy’ for the Applicant.\n345. It is simply not possible to eliminate all risk, which appears to have\nbeen the Applicant’s approach in bringing this application. We hope that the\nworks might now be progressed with all due celerity, and that the Applicants\nand Respondents are able, to some extent, to re-set their relationship to work\ntogether towards that end. It would appear that if they do not, there could be\nvery significant consequences.\n346.

For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977.

The property has pedestrian access from the estate road\nand both pedestrian and vehicular access from the A32.\n6. The property is of some age and has been extended over the years. The\naccommodation comprises on the ground floor a roomy entrance hall,\nlounge, library, study, kitchen with walk in larder, laundry room and\nWC. On the first floor are 5 bedrooms and a bathroom with full suite.\n7. Outside there are areas of garden and a good-sized parking area\naccessed off the A32.\n8. The property is in need of substantial updating. There is no central\nheating and hot water is supplied by gas fired water heaters in the\nbathroom and laundry room. There are signs of damp penetration\naround the chimney breast in two of the bedrooms and there are signs\nof some poorly executed repairs to one of the external walls. Although\nno access was available it is understood that the cellar beneath part of\nthe property has standing water.\nRepresentations/ Hearing\n9. In representations dated 13 September 2018 the tenant said that;\na. He had no records of comparable lettings and that none of the\nvarious landlords had carried out any outside or inside\ndecorations or repairs/renovations.\nb. He does not have a tenancy agreement\nc. All improvements over the last 51 years have been paid by him\nd. He doesn’t know whether demand exceeds supply but does not\nconsider this unrefurbished property would command the\nMaximum Rent set by the Rent Officer\ne. The initial rent was high but acceptable to the closeness of his\nworkplace. He considers a reduced annual rental of say £5,000\nwould be appropriate subject to urgent repairs being carried out.\n10. In the valuation report by Ray and Co dated 21 May 2018 the following\ncomparable evidence of open market lettings was provided;\na. 18 Hampton Grove Fareham; Let 2018 for £1,375 per month\nb. 2 Waterside Gardens Fareham; Let 2018 for £1,695 per month\nc. 27 Furneaux Gardens Fareham; Let 2018 at £1,250 per month\nd. Furzehall Avenue; Let 2018 at £1,650 per month\ne. 15 Coppice Way, Fareham; Let 2014 at £1,050 per month\nf. 157 Fareham park Road Fareham; Let November 2017 at £1,995\nper month.\n11. The report concludes that the best evidence are the lettings of\nWaterside Gardens, Furzehall Avenue and Fareham Park Road and that\nafter allowing for the old-style accommodation without double glazing\nand central heating his opinion of the rental value of the subject\nproperty is £1,500 per month.\n2\n\nThe law\n12. When determining a fair rent the Tribunal, in accordance with the Rent\nAct 1977, section 70, must have regard to all the circumstances\nincluding the age, location and state of repair of the property. It must\nalso disregard the effect of (a) any relevant tenant's improvements and\n(b) the effect of any disrepair or other defect attributable to the tenant\nor any predecessor in title under the regulated tenancy, on the rental\nvalue of the property.\n13. Case law informs the Tribunal;\na. That ordinarily a fair rent is the market rent for the property\ndiscounted for 'scarcity' (i.e. that element, if any, of the\nmarket rent, that is attributable to there being a significant\nshortage of similar properties in the wider locality available\nfor letting on similar terms - other than as to rent - to that of\nthe regulated tenancy) and\nb. That for the purposes of determining the market rent,\nassured tenancy (market) rents are usually appropriate\ncomparables. (These rents may have to be adjusted where\nnecessary to reflect any relevant differences between those\ncomparables and the subject property).\nValuation\n14. Thus, in the first instance the Tribunal determined what rent the\nlandlord could reasonably be expected to obtain for the property in the\nopen market if it were let today on the terms and in the condition that\nis considered usual for such an open market letting. Mr Ray provided\nevidence of the rents achieved on a number of 3, 4 and 5-bedroom\nproperties. Those preferred by Mr Ray were let at between £1,650 and\n£1,995 per month the latter having 5 bedrooms, 3 receptions, 2 en-\nsuites and was described as “top of the range”. The other two had four\nbedrooms and double or triple garages. All had central heating and\ndouble glazing.\n15. This is a most unusual property to find on the rental market as\nevidenced by the lack of close comparables provided by Mr Ray. It\nrequires considerable updating which with a Listed building will\nrequire significant expenditure. It is larger than would be required by\nmost family requirements and it nestles between a busy main road and\nan office estate with a car park abutting one boundary. Even if brought\nup to modern standards the disadvantages of its immediate location\nwould restrict its rental value.\n16. Noting that the Rent officer had taken a starting point of £1,550 per\nmonth (£18,600 per annum) the Tribunal when considering the issues\nreferred to above determined that the starting point should be £1,500\nper month.\n3\n\n17. However, the rent referred to in the above paragraph is on the basis of a\nmodern open market letting of a fully centrally heated property where\nthe tenant has no liability to carry out repairs or decorations and the\nlandlord supplies white goods, carpets and curtains. In this case the\nTenant supplies his own white goods, carpets and curtains, there is no\ncentral heating and the property is largely unmodernised.\n18. In the absence of a tenancy agreement the Rent Officer refers to the\nrepairing obligations as being agreed between the parties. The only\ninformation available to the Tribunal is from the application form\nwhich refers to the landlord having responsibility for the structure and\nexterior and the tenant for the interior and decorations.\n19. To take on such an obligation in a large listed building has the potential\nfor significant expenditure which is likely to deter many prospective\ntenants and for which an allowance must be made.\n20. In the Tribunal’s experience a prospective tenant would not go through\na detailed exercise of deductions but would make an overall assessment\nof the level of allowance that would entice them to overlook the\ndifference in amenities and obligations as offered by the subject\nproperty when compared to the lettings referred to in paragraph 10\nabove. Doing the best it can the Tribunal assesses that allowance at 50%\ngiving an adjusted rent of £750 per month or £9,000 per annum\n21. We then considered the question of scarcity as referred to in paragraph\n13a above and determined that there was none in this area of\nHampshire.\n22. We therefore determined that the uncapped Fair Rent is £9,000per\nannum exclusive of council tax and water rates with effect from 22\nNovember 2018\n23. As this amount is below the rent calculated in accordance with the\nMaximum Fair Rent Order details of which are shown on the rear of the\ndecision Notice we determine that the sum of £9,000 per\nannum is registered as the Fair Rent from 22 November 2018\nD Banfield FRICS (Chairman)\nJudge M Tildesley OBE\n22 November 2018\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application\nto the First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office, which has been dealing\nwith the case. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28\ndays after the Tribunal sends to the person making the application\nwritten reasons for the decision.\n4\n\n2. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to\nappeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide\nwhether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to\nappeal to proceed.\n3. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state\nthe result the party making the application is seeking.\n5"

The tribunal exercises its discretion to grant dispensation from the\nconsultation requirements of s20ZA for removal of a crane control box\n(the box) which had become detached from its fixings in high winds and\nwas the subject of a dangerous structures notice. The tribunal also grants\ndispensation for the storage of the box for a period in excess of one year\nwhich becomes a qualifying long term agreement while the future of the\nbox is decided.\nThe application\n2. The Applicant seeks dispensation from the consultation requirements\nunder section 20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985\nAct”) in respect of the removal and storage of a crane observation box\nfrom the external elevation. The works were said to be urgent because\nelements of the crane structure had pulled loose of their fixings in high\nwinds and were hanging dangerously over areas used by the public at\nvarying times. Additionally the subsequent need to store the box for\npotential reuse is the second element of the application with storage of\nthe box for in excess of a year deemed to constitute a qualifying long-\nterm agreement.\n3. The repairs cannot wait for a three-month consultation period due to the\ndanger caused by the failures. No formal notice was given under s20 of\nthe Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 but leaseholders have been notified\nof the works and that this application would be made. In view of the\nurgency of the it was not proposed formally consult. The likely cost of the\nworks is above the threshold for consultation under section 20 of the\n1985 Act. Representations were received from the leaseholders\nsolicitors.\n4. Directions were made on 16 September 2025 for a paper determination\nin the week commencing 27 October 2025. The only issue for the\ntribunal is whether it is reasonable to dispense with the statutory\nconsultation requirements.\n5. This decision does not concern the issue of whether any\nservice charge costs will be reasonable or payable.\nThe hearing\n6. A written application was made by the freeholder.\n7. A copy lease has been provided. The case was decided on paper and no\nappearances were made. The tribunal considered the written\napplication form, copy letters to the leaseholders, and the specimen\nlease included in the bundle and the respondents submissions.\n2\n\n8. The respondents state that the application is deficient or inadequately\nparticularised as it gives no information or details of the qualifying\nworks beyond a brief description, names of contractors or costs. There\nis limited information on the qualifying long term agreement relating to\nstorage or the amounts payable under such an agreement.\n9. The respondents accept in principle that the costs of removal of the\ncrane control box together with associated costs of any PLA licence\nscaffolding and structural engineers advice are ones where it may be\nreasonable to grant dispensation subject to the condition that the\napplicant bears its own costs without recovery of the costs through the\nservice charge and also to pay for the respondents costs of the\napplication due to the applicant’s failure to provide proper information.\n10. The respondents also contend that any order granting dispensation in\nrelation to qualifying works should not extend to undefined costs which\nare stated to be incidental to or in contemplation of the removal of the\ncontrol box. This will also apply to undefined costs relating to the\nQLTA.\n11. In reply, the applicant says it has provided all the information it\ncurrently has. What is ultimately required is uncertain depending on\nthe outcome of the Local Authority’s decision as to whether the\napplicant is obliged to reinstate the crane control box. No evidence of\nfinancial prejudice has been provided by the leaseholders.\n12. The applicant notes the respondent agrees the box had to be removed\nas an emergency but as it formed part of a listed building it needed to\nbe stored pending a decision as to its future and whether it needed to be\nrepaired and reinstated. There was no point moving it again as that\nwould incur further costs.\n13. There is currently no application under section 20C of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act or paragraph 5 of schedule 11 of the Commonhold and\nLeasehold Reform Act 2002.\nThe background\n14. The property is part of the Bombay Wharf estate consisting of\nwarehouses built around 1850 which were converted to flats about 20\nyears ago. The application relates to a building overlooking the River\nThames which has an early 20th-century lattice-jibbed crane mounted\non the northern elevation with a housing and control box at parapet\nlevel.\n15. The estate is owned by a freeholder with the applicant management\ncompany between the freeholder and leaseholders. Each flat is held on\nlong lease which requires the landlord to provide services and the\n3\n\ntenant to contribute towards their costs by way of a variable service\ncharge.\n16. An inspection was not requested and the tribunal did not consider that\none was necessary, nor would it have been proportionate to the issues.\n17. The lease shows the scope of the works is within the service charge\nprovisions of the lease. The tribunal directed the applicant to provide\ncopies of the application and directions to the lessees. Confirmation\nwas sent to the tribunal that the application had been provided to the\nleaseholders.\n18. Reasonableness and payability of the service charge is not\nwithin the scope of this application.\nThe Law\ns20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985\nService charges\n20ZA Consultation requirements: supplementary\n(1)Where an application is made to the appropriate tribunal for a\ndetermination to dispense with all or any of the consultation\nrequirements in relation to any qualifying works or qualifying long term\nagreement, the tribunal may make the determination if satisfied that it is\nreasonable to dispense with the requirements.\n(2)In section 20 and this section—\n“qualifying works” means works on a building or any other premises,\nand\n“qualifying long term agreement” means (subject to subsection (3)) an\nagreement entered into, by or on behalf of the landlord or a superior\nlandlord, for a term of more than twelve months.\n(3)The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that an agreement\nis not a qualifying long term agreement—\n(a)if it is an agreement of a description prescribed by the regulations, or\n(b)in any circumstances so prescribed.\n(4)In section 20 and this section “the consultation requirements” means\nrequirements prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State.\n4\n\n(5)Regulations under subsection (4) may in particular include provision\nrequiring the landlord—\n(a)to provide details of proposed works or agreements to tenants or the\nrecognised tenants’ association representing them,\n(b)to obtain estimates for proposed works or agreements,\n(c)to invite tenants or the recognised tenants’ association to propose the\nnames of persons from whom the landlord should try to obtain other\nestimates,\n(d)to have regard to observations made by tenants or the recognised\ntenants’ association in relation to proposed works or agreements and\nestimates, and\n(e)to give reasons in prescribed circumstances for carrying out works or\nentering into agreements.\n(5A)And in the case of works to which section 20D applies, regulations\nunder subsection (4) may also include provision requiring the landlord—\n(a)to give details of the steps taken or to be taken under section 20D(2),\n(b)to give reasons about prescribed matters, and any other prescribed\ninformation, relating to the taking of such steps, and\n(c)to have regard to observations made by tenants or the recognised\ntenants’ association in relation to the taking of such steps.\n(6)Regulations under section 20 or this section—\n(a)may make provision generally or only in relation to specific cases, and\n(b)may make different provision for different purposes.\n(7)Regulations under section 20 or this section shall be made by statutory\ninstrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a\nresolution of either House of Parliament.\n19. The applicable case law is Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson [2013]\nUKSC 14, 1 WLR 854 where the Supreme Court held that the relevant\ntest is whether the leaseholders have suffered prejudice by the failure to\nconsult. Where the extent, quality and cost of the works were unaffected\nby the landlord’s failure to comply with the consultation requirements,\nan unconditional dispensation should normally be granted.\n5\n\nThe tribunal’s decision\n20. The tribunal exercises its discretion to grant dispensation from the\nconsultation requirements of under s20 ZA of the Landlord and Tenant\nAct 1985 and the Service Charges (Consultation Requirements)\n(England) Regulations 2003\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n21. The works were necessary to remove a dangerous part of the building.\n22. The tribunal is satisfied that the leaseholders were aware of the\napplication and have made representations.\n23. The Tribunal is being asked to exercise its discretion under s.20ZA of\nthe Act. The wording of s.20ZA is significant. Subs. (1) provides:\n“Where an application is made to a [leasehold valuation] tribunal for a\ndetermination to dispense with all or any of the consultation\nrequirements in relation to any qualifying works or qualifying long term\nagreement, the tribunal may make the determination if satisfied that it\nis reasonable to dispense with the requirements” (emphasis added).\n24. The Tribunal understands that the purpose of the consultation\nrequirements is to ensure that leaseholders are given the fullest\npossible opportunity to make observations about expenditure of money\nfor which they will in part be liable. The test laid down by the Supreme\nCourt in Daejan v Benson is whether the leaseholders would suffer\nprejudice if the application were to be granted and a full consultation\nnot carried out.\n25. The tribunal considers that there is no prejudice to the leaseholders in\ngranting dispensation as the works were urgently required to alleviate\nan immediate danger. The current storage arrangements avoids the\nincurring of additional costs involved in moving the box.\n26. The tribunal is satisfied the works were urgent and that dispensation\nshould be granted.\n27. The granting of dispensation is not concerned with the cost and\nrecoverability of service charges for the works which are dealt with\nunder section 27A of the Act.\n28. Costs are a matter for any s27A application.\nName: A Harris Date: 28 October 2025\n6\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n7"

J. Ellis\nTribunal Member Mr R.P.Cammidge FRICS.\nDate of Hearing : 2 November 2018\nDate of Decision : 16 November 2018\nDECISION\nCrown Copyright © 2018\n\nThe sum payable by the Respondent for the Applicant’s costs is £931.00\nplus VAT 186.20; valuer’s fee £350.00 plus VAT £70.00 and Land\nRegistry fees of £24.00 in total the sum of £1561.20\n1. This is an application for determination of reasonable costs incurred in\nconnection with a new lease to be paid by a tenant under s60(1) of the\nLeasehold Reform and Urban Development Act 1993 (the Act).\n2. The Applicant is Halliard Property Company represented by its solicitors\nWallace LLP of Portland Place London W1. The Respondent is Michael Andrew\nJordan represented by his solicitors Kenneth Curtis & Company of Aldridge\nRoad Perry Barr Birmingham.\n3. The property the subject of the relevant notice of claim under s42 of the Act\nwas First Floor Flat 9 Derwent Court, Garrard Gardens, Sutton Coldfield, B73\n6DR. Although the parties agreed the terms of acquisition in October 2017 a\nnew lease was not agreed. Consequently, by reason of the deeming provisions\nof s53(1)(b) of the Act the Respondent’s notice of claim was withdrawn. The\nApplicant now seeks its costs incurred in connection with the claim for lease\nextension pursuant to ss60 and 91 of the Act.\n4. The sum claimed is £1353.50 and VAT of £270.70 with disbursements of Land\nRegistry Fees (£24.00) and valuers fee (£420.00 inclusive of VAT). The\nRespondent does not dispute his liability to pay the Applicant’s costs but\ndenies that the sum claimed is reasonable. The Applicant issued this\napplication to determine the sum payable was issued on 18 July 2018. The\nTribunal issued Directions on 19 July 2018. Neither side requested an oral\nhearing. The matter was determined by the Tribunal on 2 November 2018.\n5. The Direction required each side to submit their statements of case which have\nbeen considered by the Tribunal in coming to its decision.\n\n6. The Applicant’s schedule of costs and the Tribunal’s decision are set out in the\nAnnex to this Decision.\nThe Issues\n7. The issue between the parties is substantially in connection with the rates\ncharged by the Applicant’s solicitors although there is a challenge to the some\nof the work done including the costs associated with the draft lease. There is no\ndispute over the disbursements.\n8. The Respondent asserts the Applicant’s claim for costs is disproportionate to\nthe value of the leasehold interest negotiated. In summary the Respondent\nsubmits that a sum no more than double the valuation fee of £350 would be a\nreasonable sum for the Respondent to pay. He also challenges the hourly rate\nproposed by Wallace LLP.\n9. The Applicant asserts that all work done is properly the subject of the claim\nand that the hourly rates charged are reasonable for a central London law firm\nundertaking specialist work. It also asserts that proportionality is not relevant\nto the assessment of costs payable under s60 of the Act.\nThe Statutory Provisions\n10. Section 60 of the Act provides:\n“1)Where a notice is given under section 42, then (subject to the provisions of\nthis section) the tenant by whom it is given shall be liable, to the extent that\nthey have been incurred by any relevant person in pursuance of the notice,\nfor the reasonable costs of and incidental to any of the following matters,\nnamely—\n(a)any investigation reasonably undertaken of the tenant’s right to a new\nlease;\n(b)any valuation of the tenant’s flat obtained for the purpose of fixing the\npremium or any other amount payable by virtue of Schedule 13 in connection\nwith the grant of a new lease under section 56;\n(c)the grant of a new lease under that section;\nbut this subsection shall not apply to any costs if on a sale made voluntarily a\nstipulation that they were to be borne by the purchaser would be void.\n(2)For the purposes of subsection (1) any costs incurred by a relevant person\nin respect of professional services rendered by any person shall only be\nregarded as reasonable if and to the extent that costs in respect of such\n\nservices might reasonably be expected to have been incurred by him if the\ncircumstances had been such that he was personally liable for all such costs.\n(3)Where by virtue of any provision of this Chapter the tenant’s notice ceases\nto have effect, or is deemed to have been withdrawn, at any time, then\n(subject to subsection (4)) the tenant’s liability under this section for costs\nincurred by any person shall be a liability for costs incurred by him down to\nthat time.”\nS91 of the Act vests the Tribunal with jurisdiction to determine:\n(d)the amount of any costs payable by any person or persons by virtue of\nany provision of Chapter I or II and, in the case of costs to which section\n33(1) or 60(1) applies, the liability of any person or persons\nby virtue of any such provision to pay any such costs.\nDiscussion\n11. Both sides submitted previous decisions of the First-tier Tribunal which are\nhelpful but not binding upon this Tribunal. Moreover, the principles of\ndetermining costs outlined by both sides are substantially formulated in recent\ndecisions of the Upper Tribunal. In particular the decisons in Sinclair Gardens\nv Wisbey [2016] UKUT 203 (LC); Metropolitan Property Realisations Ltd v\nMoss [2013] UKUT 0415(LC) and Sidewalk Properties Limted v\nTwinn[2015]UKUT 0122\n12. In Sinclair Gardens v Wisbey HH Judge Huskinson said in connection with a\nlease extension case pursuant to s60 of the Leasehold Reform and Urban\nDevelopment Act 1993\n“In my judgment on the proper construction of section 60 there is a burden\nupon the landlord who is claiming costs for professional services (which\ntherefore fall within section 60(2)) to prove that the costs are (and the extent\nto which the costs are) reasonable. This follows from the provision that costs\n“shall only be regarded as reasonable” if and to the extent provided for by the\nfollowing words.”\n13. The standard of proof required of the landlord described in Metropolitan\nProperty Realisations Ltd v Moss [2013] UKUT 0415(LC) is the “reasonable\nexpectation test”. Mr Martin Rodger QC the Deputy President giving the\n\ndecision of the Upper Tribunal that the band of costs recoverable under the\nreasonable expectation test has a ceiling of the costs which would have been paid\nby the landlord if paying them itself and is not restricted to the costs which the\nTribunal considers to be reasonable.\n14. After reciting the relevant provisions of section 60 he said:\n9. These provisions are straightforward and their purpose is readily\nunderstandable. Part I of the 1993 Act is expropriatory, in that it confers\nvaluable rights on tenants of leasehold flats to compel their landlords to grant\nnew interests in those premises whether they are willing to do so or not. It is a\nmatter of basic fairness, necessary to avoid the statute from becoming penal,\nthat the tenant exercising those statutory rights should reimburse the costs\nnecessarily incurred by any person in receipt of such a claim in satisfying\nthemselves that the claim is properly made, in obtaining advice on the sum\npayable by the tenant in consideration for the new interest and in completing\nthe formal steps necessary to create it.\n10. On the other hand, the statute is not intended to provide an opportunity\nfor the professional advisers of landlords to charge excessive fees, nor are\ntenants expected to pay landlords’ costs of resolving disputes over the terms of\nacquisition of new leases. Thus the sums payable by a tenant under section 60\nare restricted to those incurred by the landlord within the three categories\nidentified in section 60(1) and are further restricted by the requirement that only\nreasonable costs are payable. Section 60(2) provides a ceiling by reference to\nthe reasonable expectations of a person paying the costs from their own pocket;\nthe costs of work which would not have been incurred, or which would have been\ncarried out more cheaply, if the landlord was personally liable to meet them are\nnot reasonable costs which the tenant is required to pay.\n11. Section 60 therefore provides protection for both landlords and tenants:\nfor landlords against being out of pocket when compelled to grant new interests\nunder the Act, and for tenants against being required to pay more than is\nreasonable.”\n15. The decision of the Tribunal in this case is not whether the use of London\nsolicitors is reasonable but the reasonableness of the fees claimed by the\n\nRespondent from the Applicant. In Sinclair Gardens v Wisbey [2016] UKUT\n0203 (LC) His Honour Judge Huskinson sitting with the Registrar as an\nassessor said:\n‘‘On a proper construction of Section 60 there is a burden upon the\nRespondents claiming costs for professional services (which therefore fall\nwithin section 60(2)) to prove that the costs are (and the extent to which the\ncosts are) reasonable. This follows from the provision that costs ‘‘shall only be\nregarded as reasonable’’ if and to the extent provided for by the following’’.\n16. The Upper Tribunal further considered the meaning and effect of section 60 of\nthe Act in another decision of Martin Rodger QC the Deputy President in\nSidewalk Properties Limited v Twinn[2015]UKUT 0122, a case also involving,\nin part, the use of solicitors with higher charging rates than solicitors local to the\nproperty which was in Bury St Edmunds Suffolk. At paragraph 40 of his Decision\nhe said:\n“The question of the appropriate hourly rate to be used as a guide involves a\nchoicebetween London and Bury St Edmunds rates. That choice cannot be\ndeterminative however, both because London rates are themselves a range,\nand because even after carrying out an arithmetical calculation based on one\nrate or the other it is still necessary to consider the ceiling imposed by s60(2)\nand to ask whether the resulting figure represents the cost which would have\nbeen incurred had the appellant been required to pay for the necessary legal\nservices from its own pocket without the right to pass the charges to the\nrespondents”\nDecision\n17. The Tribunal agrees that its role is to determine what sum is reasonable for the\nleaseholder to pay having regard to the work allowable and the cap on those\ncosts described by Martin Rodger QC.\n18. It is not for the Tribunal to interfere with a party’s choice of solicitor. Also it is\nunderstood that a party will appoint a solicitor skilled in the relevant area of law.\n\nHowever, that does not mean the fees charged are for those reasons, a priori,\nreasonable.\n19. The burden is on the Applicant to satisfy the test of reasonableness. In this case\nthe Applicant has described the work done and the rate charged but the\nengagement letter describing the basis of charge is not disclosed. The\nApplicant’s case is based on the presumption that an hourly rate and time\ncalculation is the only method of quantifying fees.\n20. Wallace LLP submits that it has been acting for the Applicant for many years in\nconnection with enfranchisement matters. The Tribunal acknowledges that it is\na firm with substantial experience in these matters. In the circumstances rather\nthan a rate per hour it should be possible to agree a fixed fee rate for the job.\nMoreover, although it is proper for a partner to have oversight of matters a\ncompetent solicitor under effective supervision is capable of conducting the\nmajority of work associated with an enfranchisement matter.\n21. The issue of proportionality was raised by the Respondent and rejected by the\nApplicant because of the reasonableness test. That submission is correct but,\nwhen seeking to balance the respective claims it is appropriate to look at the test\nof proportionality as the overall sum payable must be one which the Applicant\nwould pay if paying the fees itself.\n22. Part 44(3)(2)(a) Civil Procedure Rules provides that the court when making an\nassessment of costs will only allow costs which are proportionate to the matters\nin issue. Although the obligation to pay costs under section 60 is a separate basis\nof appraising what costs are payable, the ceiling imposed by section 60(2) and\nits application by the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal means that\nthere is no right to an indemnity for the costs which the landlord has agreed to\npay its professional advisers. Therefore, just as the court guidelines are helpful\nin identifying hourly rates, so too the general principle of proportionality is\nhelpful in deciding the reasonableness of costs payable by the leaseholders.\n\nChargeable Rate\n23. The Tribunal does not decide what are the rates a chargeable by solicitors in\nCentral London but it must decide whether the sum deduced is reasonable for\nthe Respondent to pay. This Tribunal has frequently considered claims for costs\nunder s60(1) and makes decisions which are appropriate for each different case.\nIn this case the Tribunal is not satisfied the Applicant has discharged the burden\nof proof upon it to justify the hourly rate claimed and substitutes the hourly rate\nof £350.00 for a partner, £230.00 for an assistant and £125.00 for a paralegal\nin accordance with another case of this Tribunal such as Turner v Brickfield\nProperties Limited BIR/00CN/OC9/2016/0014 adjusted for the movement in\ncharges since that decision.\nThe Sum Payable\n24. The work described is reasonable in the circumstances of the rather drawn out\nconduct of the case. However, the use of partner was greater than necessary. The\ndecision of the Tribunal is set out in the Annex to this decision. There is no\nchallenge over the valuer’s fee or the land registry fee. The sum allowed for profit\ncosts is £931.00 plus vat of 186.20.\n25. If the Respondent is not registered for VAT then the gross sum is payable.\nAppeal\n26. If either party is dissatisfied with this decision they may apply to this Tribunal\nfor permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber). Any such\napplication must be received within 28 days after these written reasons have\nbeen sent to the parties (rule 52 of The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)\n(Property Chamber) Rules 2013).\nTribunal Judge PJ Ellis\nChair"

Hadley\nMr H. Thomas FRICS\nDate and venue of : 27 October 2025\nHearing Civil & Family Court, Liverpool\nDate of Decision : 25 November 2025\n_______________________________________________\nDECISION\n____________________________________\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2025\n1\n\nDECISION\nThe financial penalty notice dated 16 October 2024 is varied. Mr\nMalik Abdul Aziz must therefore pay a financial penalty of £1,500 to\nLiverpool City Council.\nREASONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe appeal\n1. On 1 November 2024, Mr Malik Abdul Aziz appealed to the Tribunal\nagainst a financial penalty imposed on him by Liverpool City Council\n(“the Respondent”) under section 249A(1) of the Housing Act 2004 (“the\n2004 Act”). The financial penalty related to an alleged housing offence\nin respect of premises known as Apartment 2, 1A Vicar Road, Liverpool\nL6 0BW (“the Property”).\n2. To be more precise, the Applicant appealed against a final notice dated 16\nOctober 2024 given to him by the Respondent under paragraph 6 of\nSchedule 13A to the 2004 Act (“the Final Notice”). It imposed a financial\npenalty of £6,750.00 for alleged conduct amounting to an offence under\nsection 95 of the 2004 Act.\nThe hearing\n3. The appeal was heard in person on 27 October 2025. The Applicant\nrepresented himself. The Respondent was represented by Ms Lisa Feng\n(Counsel).\n4. The Applicant gave oral evidence having first given an affirmation to the\nTribunal because his written submissions omitted to include a Statement\nof Truth. The Tribunal also heard oral evidence from a witness for the\nRespondent: Mr Gregory Prescott (a Technical Compliance Officer\nemployed by the Council). Opportunity was given for each witness to be\ncross-examined. The Respondent also relied upon the written witness\nstatements of Ms Jennifer Driscoll (a Private Sector Housing Selective\nLicensing Manager employed by the Respondent), Mr Steven Bowers\n(Deputy Head of Private Sector Housing (Interim) employed by the\nRespondent) and Mr Steven Daniels (a Technical Compliance Officer\nemployed by the Respondent). Oral submissions were also made by both\nparties. In addition, the Tribunal considered the documentary evidence\nprovided by the parties in support of their respective cases.\n5. The Tribunal did not inspect the Property prior to the hearing, but\nunderstands it to comprise a residential, leasehold apartment.\n6. There were two preliminary issues for the Tribunal to deal with, both\nrelating to the late filing of documents. First, the Respondent had\nomitted from its bundle evidence of emails sent in 2021 and 2022 to\n2\n\nlandlords on a redacted spreadsheet who were existing licence holders\nunder a previous licensing scheme, which included the Applicant’s\nhotmail email address (“the Mail Merge Evidence”). Second, the\nTribunal noted that the Applicant had submitted a Supplemental Reply\nto the Respondent’s Supplementary Response with additional evidence\n(“the Applicant’s Additional Evidence”) outside of the steps directed by\nthe Tribunal on 19 June 2025. Given that neither party objected to the\ninclusion of the other party’s late evidence, the Tribunal determined to\ninclude both documents in the bundle pursuant to the overriding\nobjective at Rule 3 and its case management powers at Rule 6(3)(a) of\nThe Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules\n2013.\n7. The Respondent wished to clarify in relation to the Mail Merge Evidence\nthat, at the time that those emails were sent, he was not an existing\nlicence holder in relation to the Property. The Respondent’s previous\nlicensing scheme related to other areas of Liverpool, and the Applicant\nwas on the Respondent’s spreadsheet because he owned two other\nproperties in areas where the previous scheme had applied, and he had\nthe relevant licences for those other properties. The Tribunal and the\nApplicant acknowledged and noted that fact.\nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK\nPower to impose financial penalties\n8. New provisions were inserted into the 2004 Act by section 126 and\nSchedule 9 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016. One of those\nprovisions was section 249A, which came into force on 6 April 2017. It\nenables a local housing authority to impose a financial penalty on a\nperson if satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person’s conduct\namounts to a “relevant housing offence” in respect of premises in\nEngland.\n9. Relevant housing offences are listed in section 249A(2). They include the\noffence (under section 95) of having control of or managing a house\nwhich is required to be licensed under Part 3 of the 2004 Act, but which\nis not so licensed.\n10. Only one financial penalty under section 249A may be imposed on a\nperson in respect of the same conduct. The amount of that penalty is\ndetermined by the local housing authority (but it may not exceed\n£30,000), and its imposition is an alternative to instituting criminal\nproceedings for the offence in question.\nProcedural requirements\n11. Schedule 13A to the 2004 Act sets out the procedure which local housing\nauthorities must follow in relation to financial penalties imposed under\n3\n\nsection 249A. Before imposing such a penalty on a person, the local\nhousing authority must give him or her a notice of intent setting out:\n• the amount of the proposed financial penalty;\n• the reasons for proposing to impose it; and\n• information about the right to make representations.\n12. Unless the conduct to which the financial penalty relates is continuing,\nthat notice must be given before the end of the period of six months\nbeginning on the first day on which the local housing authority has\nsufficient evidence of that conduct.\n13. A person who is given a notice of intent has the right to make written\nrepresentations to the local housing authority about the proposal to\nimpose a financial penalty. Any such representations must be made\nwithin the period of 28 days, beginning with the day after that on which\nthe notice of intent was given. After the end of that period, the local\nhousing authority must decide whether to impose a financial penalty\nand, if a penalty is to be imposed, its amount.\n14. If the local housing authority decides to impose a financial penalty on a\nperson, it must give that person a final notice setting out:\n• the amount of the financial penalty;\n• the reasons for imposing it;\n• information about how to pay the penalty;\n• the period for payment of the penalty;\n• information about rights of appeal; and\n• the consequences of failure to comply with the notice.\nAppeals\n15. A final notice given under Schedule 13A to the 2004 Act must require the\npenalty to be paid within the period of 28 days beginning with the day\nafter that on which the notice was given. However, this is subject to the\nright of the person to whom a final notice is given to appeal to this\nTribunal (under paragraph 10 of Schedule 13A).\n16. The appeal is by way of a re-hearing of the local housing authority’s\ndecision but may be determined by the Tribunal having regard to\nmatters of which the authority was unaware. The Tribunal may confirm,\nvary or cancel the final notice. However, the Tribunal may not vary a final\nnotice so as to make it impose a financial penalty of more than the local\nhousing authority could have imposed.\nRELEVANT GUIDANCE\n17. A local housing authority must have regard to any guidance given by the\nSecretary of State about the exercise of its functions in respect of the\nimposition of financial penalties. Such guidance (“the HCLG Guidance”)\nwas issued by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local\nGovernment in April 2018: Civil penalties under the Housing and\n4\n\nPlanning Act 2016 – Guidance for Local Housing Authorities. It states\nthat local housing authorities are expected to develop and document\ntheir own policy on when to prosecute and when to issue a financial\npenalty and should decide which option to pursue on a case-by-case\nbasis. The HCLG Guidance also states that local housing authorities\nshould develop and document their own policy on determining the\nappropriate level of penalty in a particular case. However, it goes on to\nstate:\n“Generally, we would expect the maximum amount to be reserved for\nthe very worst offenders. The actual amount levied in any particular\ncase should reflect the severity of the offence as well as taking account\nof the landlord’s previous record of offending.”\n18. The HCLG Guidance also sets out the following list of factors which local\nhousing authorities should consider to ensure that financial penalties are\nset at an appropriate level:\na. Severity of the offence.\nb. Culpability and track record of the offender.\nc. The harm caused to the tenant.\nd. Punishment of the offender.\ne. Deterrence of the offender from repeating the offence.\nf. Deterrence of others from committing similar offences.\ng. Removal of any financial benefit the offender may have obtained as a\nresult of committing the offence.\n19. In recognition of the expectation that local housing authorities will\ndevelop and document their own policies on financial penalties, the\nRespondent has issued its own Private Sector Housing Civil Penalties\nPolicy (“the Respondent’s Policy”). A copy of the Respondent’s Policy\nwas included within the bundle, and we make further reference to this\npolicy later in these reasons.\nBACKGROUND FACTS\n20. The Respondent is responsible for the licensing of houses within its\ndistrict under Part 3 of the 2004 Act. Since 1 April 2022, the Respondent\nhas been operating a selective licensing scheme, pursuant to s.80 of the\n2004 Act. The selective licensing scheme requires a licence to be\nobtained from the Respondent in order to control and/or manage certain\nprivately rented properties situated in the designated areas which\ninclude the area of Anfield, where the Property is located.\n21. On 4 March 2024, an investigating officer for the Respondent, Mr\nGregory Prescott, visited the Property to assess whether the Property\nwas being let. The occupiers of the Property confirmed that they were\ntenants and presented a tenancy agreement to Mr Prescott which\nshowed the Applicant to be the landlord. Later that day, Mr Prescott\nreceived a telephone call from the Applicant during which the Applicant\n5\n\nsaid that he would make the application for a licence that day, although\nthat did not happen.\n22. From the tenancy agreement commencement date, the tenants of the\nProperty moved in on 1 October 2023. From the register of title obtained\nfrom H.M. Land Registry, the Respondent also established that the\nApplicant, Malik Abdulo Aziz was the registered leasehold owner of the\nProperty. This was accepted by the Applicant at the hearing.\n23. On 14 March 2024, a Respondent officer wrote to the Applicant under\nsection 16 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976\nto request certain information (the “s 16 Notice”). The Applicant did not\nrespond to that notice, which is a separate offence.\n24. The Applicant was invited to attend a voluntary interview under the\nPolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 but did not attend.\n25. On 16 April 2024, the Applicant made the licence application, and the\nlicence was subsequently granted on 13 May 2024.\n26. Following a Respondent case conference review meeting, the\nRespondent served the Applicant with a notice of intention to impose a\nfinancial penalty dated 24 September 2024 (“the Notice of Intent”). The\nNotice of Intent proposed a financial penalty of £6,750.00 (the\n“Penalty”).\n27. The Penalty was calculated on the following factors:\na. Level of culpability – High\nb. Level of harm – Medium\nc. Aggravating factors – None\nd. Mitigating factor – 25% reduction in penalty as the Applicant\nhad no relevant unspent convictions or relevant cautions or civil\npenalties within the last two years.\n28. According to the Respondent’s Policy, when calculating a financial\npenalty, the Respondent assesses the economic benefit to the property\nowners to ensure that there is no financial benefit to the owner for non-\ncompliance. In this case, the Council had found that the Applicant had\nmade no economic gain from the offence and so no adjustment to the\nPenalty was made in that regard.\n29. According to the Respondent’s Policy, the Respondent should consider\nwhether there has been an early admission of guilt by the Applicant and,\nif so, should consider a reduction to the penalty amount, the maximum\npermitted level of reduction being one-third of the penalty amount. In\nthis case, the Respondent considered that there had been no admission\nof guilt during the investigation or thereafter and so made no reduction\nto the penalty accordingly.\n6\n\n30. The Respondent received written representations from the Applicant on\n27 September 2024 in which the Applicant set out details of his health\nissues.\n31. The Respondent saw no reason to alter the Penalty, and, on 16 October\n2024, the Final Notice was served upon the Applicant citing the Penalty.\n32. On 1 November 2024, the Applicant submitted his appeal to the\nTribunal in respect of the Final Notice.\nThe Applicant’s Submissions\n33. The Applicant accepts that the Property was not licensed at the time\nthat the Respondent conducted its visit on 4 March 2024. The Applicant\nconfirmed, during the hearing, that he accepted there was a legal\nrequirement on him to obtain the licence, and he had never denied that\nfact.\n34. The Applicant submits that he has a reasonable excuse for not licensing\nthe Property as he was not aware that a licence was required in that area\nof Liverpool due to exceptional personal health circumstances including\nmajor heart surgery and ongoing recovery. The Applicant underwent\nquadruple open-hear surgery in 2022, which was a major event in his life\nand a major shock to him and everyone around him. This overlapped\nwith the period when the new selective licensing scheme was being rolled\nout, and it did not have his attention as it should have done. As a result,\nhe was unaware that the scheme had expanded. Had he been aware, he\nwould have applied for a licence. He made a mistake and it was not a\ndeliberate attempt to avoid compliance.\n35. The Applicant submits that he experienced ongoing health challenges,\naffecting his focus and management abilities and that there was a long-\nterm impact of such major surgery, both physically and mentally.\n36. He also submits that he did not receive and / or read communications\nfrom the Respondent. In particular, many emails often end up in his\nspam folder. He has a portfolio of work, a number of email accounts and\na high volume of emails so he may have inadvertently missed emails.\nKeeping on top of his emails had become challenging.\n37. He also submits that certain letters, although correctly addressed by the\nRespondent, may have been wrongly delivered to nearby properties\nwhich have similar addresses. There are two similar addresses in the\nvicinity, and the post deliveries are often mixed up between those\naddresses. Once he became aware of this investigation, he was more\nconscious of going to check at the other addresses to collect any wrongly\ndelivered post. He would have acted on the letters once he received them.\n38. In terms of the six-week delay between the Applicant becoming aware\nof the offence and him submitting the licence application, he does not\naccept that this shows wilful blindness. He took steps during that time\n7\n\nto make the application as best he could at the time and there was\nnothing more he could do. He called the Selective Licensing team at the\nRespondent two or three times before he finally spoke to a woman who\nassisted him with submitting the application. He also said during the\nhearing that he was 100% sure he asked Mr Prescott for a remote\ninterview under caution using Teams, because he did not want to travel\ndue to his health, and that he was told the Respondent did not offer this.\nHe was confused that there were two sets of proceedings going on\nbecause he was also being pursued by the Respondent in relation to his\nfailure to respond to the s 16 Notice at that time. Responding within six\nweeks seemed reasonable to him.\n39. The other Respondent team investigating the criminal offence of failing\nto respond to the S 16 Notice understood his medical issues and accepted\nthe difficulties he had had with communications, and they had dropped\nthat case.\n40. In addition, the Applicant argues that the Penalty is excessive and\nmanifestly disproportionate.\n41. In calculating the financial penalty itself, the Respondent was wrong to\nfind that culpability was high. He had made a genuine mistake and had\ndealt with it as best he could. The Applicant provided all the documents\nthat he had to the Respondent as early as possible. Other documents took\ntime to locate, and he had commissioned new ones to enable the\napplication. He had provided the outstanding gas certificates prior to the\nhearing, but the Respondent had not taken account of them. In terms of\nthe electricity safety records, a new consumer unit was installed in 2020\nand the electrician who worked on the Property in 2023 had confirmed\nin writing that the consumer unit in 2023 was a relatively new one and\nall was in good order at that time. The Applicant had also submitted\nphotographic evidence showing the work undertaken to the Property\nprior to the tenancy to support this.\n42. The level of harm caused was nowhere near high level of risk. Again, the\nRespondent had not taken account of the historic gas certificates in its\ncalculation. Everything at the Property had been in order. The\nphotographs provided demonstrated how the Property had been\nupgraded and brought back into use by the Applicant. The Applicant\nsubmits that he has always been a good landlord.\n43. The Applicant submits that the Respondent had not taken account of\nmitigating factors. In terms of whether he had made an early admission,\nhe did not see where there was any scope for him to have done anything\ndifferently. He considered his accepting that he did not have the licence\nand then getting one to be the same thing as “agreeing” to the offence.\n44. The Applicant submits that the Respondent has been inconsistent in the\nway that it has taken enforcement action against other landlords in the\nsame block as the Property and one flat remains unlicensed.\n8\n\nThe Respondent’s Submissions\n45. The Respondent argues that the Applicant has not discharged the\nburden of proof to show that he had a reasonable excuse for failing to\nobtain the licence. Whilst the medical evidence provided by the\nApplicant confirms his operation in 2022, he was discharged from\nhospital in May 2022 and there is no evidence of treatment in 2023. The\nheart procedure was 16 months before the period of offending. The\nApplicant is an experienced landlord, operating a business as a director\nof a company and, by October 2023, he was well enough to be involved\nin signing the tenancy agreement for the Property. If the Applicant was\nunable to manage the Property, he had the option of appointing an agent.\n46. In terms of the level of Penalty, the Respondent refers to the case of\nWaltham Forest LBC v (1) Marshall (2) Ustek [2020] UKUT0035 (LC)\nand submits that this reinforced the importance of the Respondent’s own\npolicy. The Respondent’s Policy is the starting point and no real reason\nto depart from the Respondent’s Policy has been put forward by the\nApplicant.\n47. The penalty has been assessed in accordance with the Respondent’s\nPolicy, as demonstrated by the detailed reasons provided by the\nRespondent with the notices.\n48. In terms of culpability, the Respondent submits that Applicant either\nhad actual foresight of or wilful blindness to the risk of offending since\nhe was notified of the requirement and ought to have known. Details\nwere sent to him by email on seven separate occasions in 2022 as\nevidenced by the Mail Merge Evidence. These were sent to the\nApplicant’s hotmail address which he confirmed to be an important and\nactive account. A letter was also sent on 22 January 2024. Furthermore,\nthe Applicant has experience as a landlord and a number of other\nproperties and so ought to have been aware and had a duty to find out\nhis obligations as a landlord.\n49. Even if there was a lack of knowledge in 2022, there was knowledge in\n2024, and this adds to culpability. The Applicant accepts that he was\naware of the requirement from 4 March 2024, but the application for a\nlicence was not made until 16 April 2024 which is a substantial delay.\nThe Respondent relies upon further correspondence sent to the\nApplicant during this time. No evidence has been provided that the\nApplicant was confused or needed help with the process. Rather, in a\nvoicemail left on 18 March 2025 by the Applicant to Mr Prescott, the\nApplicant stated that he was arranging gas and electricity certificates so\nhe could make the application. During this time, the Applicant failed to\n9\n\nengage including failing to comply with the s 16 Notice and to attend the\ninterview under caution.\n50. All correspondence was correctly addressed to the Applicant, and the\nRespondent submits that it is unlikely that all the letters, and in\nparticular the two crucial letters dated 22 January 2024 and 14 March\n2024, went astray.\n51. The Respondent submits that Mr Prescott wrote to the Applicant on 1\nMay 2024, following his failure to attend the interview under caution,\nstating that he had not heard from the Applicant and that that letter is\nevidence that the Applicant never asked for the interview to be held via\nTeams.\n52. In terms of harm, even if a property is in perfect condition, the lack of\nlicensing is an offence. The Applicant’s alleged responsible approach to\nproperty management and the state of the Property are not relevant. The\nlicence is required so that the Respondent can have oversight of the\nproperty, and, therefore, a lack of a licence application undermines the\nrole of the regulator.\n53. The Applicant appears to have taken steps to obtain gas and electricity\nsafety certificates after the offence was discovered and this indicates that\nthose legally required documents were not held in advance. The new\nelectricity safety certificate confirms, on the face of it, that the\ndistribution centre was replaced suggesting that the Property was not\nsafe beforehand.\n54. Whilst the Respondent has acknowledged no actual harm was caused,\nthe fact that the Applicant did not have the required certificates means\nthat harm could have occurred and the risk was greater than it would\nhave been.\n55. In terms of mitigating factors, the Applicant’s medical issues 16 months\nprior to the offence had been considered by the Respondent and was\ncovered in the Respondent’s detailed response.\n56. The Applicant has never admitted the offence given his position that he\nhad a reasonable excuse and so no reduction was made for an early\nadmission of guilt. Mr Prescott stated, during cross examination, that\nsuch an admission would need to have been made at the interview under\ncaution which the Applicant did not attend.\n57. The breach period is a prolonged period and is an aggravating factor\nwhich the Respondent could have had regard to.\n58. The Respondent’s representative also went through a list of authorities\nprovided by the Applicant and asserted that three cases could not be\nfound, and that the other cases were either not relevant or the points\nmade by the Applicant were not reflective of the actual decisions.\n10\n\nThe Tribunal’s Deliberations and Determinations\n59. The Tribunal, under paragraph 10 of Schedule 13A to the 2004 Act, may\nconfirm, vary, or cancel a final notice, determining the matter as a re-\nhearing of the local authority’s decision.\n60. In reaching its determination the Tribunal considered the relevant law\nand all evidence submitted, both written and oral, and briefly\nsummarised above. The Tribunal also notes that the Applicant accepted\nthat, at the relevant time, he was unlicensed.\nReasonable Excuse\n61. Under s.249A of the 2004 Act, a local authority may only impose a\nfinancial penalty on a person if it is satisfied ‘beyond reasonable doubt’\nthat a person’s conduct amounts to a relevant housing offence. Pursuant\nto s.95(4) of the 2004 Act, the landlord has a defence to the offence if he\nhad a reasonable excuse for having control of or managing the property\nin question without a licence.\n62. In deciding this question, the Tribunal considered the guidance set out\nby the Upper Tribunal in Marigold v Wells [2023] UKUT 33 LC. In\nparagraph 48 of the judgment, the Upper Tribunal referred to three steps\nwhich the First-tier Tribunal could use when deciding whether such a\ndefence was established: firstly, which facts give rise to the offence;\nsecondly, which of those facts were proven; and, thirdly, whether if\nviewed objectively those facts did amount to a reasonable excuse.\n63. In terms of the impact of the Applicant’s health, the Applicant has\nprovided evidence that he underwent major heart surgery on 16 May\n2022. His medical records show that he was being investigated for heart\nproblems from late 2021 and into early 2022, before being diagnosed\nwith severe triple vessel disease of the heart in March 2022. He was\ndischarged in respect of that surgery on 21 May 2022 but subsequently\ntakes medication including an antidepressant. He gave oral evidence\nthat that event continued to have an impact on him afterwards both\nphysically and mentally. During cross-examination and in his closing\nsubmission, the Applicant was visibly distressed when speaking about\nthe impact it had had on him mentally and found it difficult to elaborate\non that subject. Whilst the letters from his GP dated 30 July 2024 and 5\nSeptember 2025 were produced in relation to different proceedings, the\nfirst letter talks about Mr Aziz suffering from “mental health problems”\nand that the proceedings which were the subject of that letter were “likely\nto cause a relapse of his mental health problems”, supporting the fact\nthat the Applicant had been living with poor mental health for some time\nbefore that date.\n64. However, the Applicant has not produced any medical evidence to\ndemonstrate that he was incapacitated by his continuing health issues,\nphysical or mental, during 2023 and 2024, and the evidence before the\n11\n\nTribunal is that, by October 2023, he was well enough to let the Property\nand to deal with the paperwork and sign the tenancy agreement.\n65. In terms of the difficulties which the Applicant said he experienced with\ncommunications, the Applicant gave frank evidence that he received an\noverwhelming amount of emails and that he probably had received some\nof the emails sent by the Respondent, and also that he had had to\nimprove his process for managing emails including checking spam\nfolders.\n66. In terms of receiving letters by post, the Applicant also gave frank\nevidence that he accepted that the Respondent had correctly addressed\nletters to him and he may have received some letters but he was not 100%\nsure he did, and that could have been due to ongoing issues which he has\nhad with his post being sent to two addresses in the vicinity with similar\naddresses. The two addresses referred to are indeed like his own address\nand near his address.\n67. The Applicant had previously obtained the correct licences for his two\nother properties under a previous scheme, and he told the Tribunal that,\nhad he been aware, he would have applied for the licence for the\nProperty.\n68. The Tribunal accepts the Applicant’s evidence that the surgery had a\nmajor impact on his life and that it continued to have a significant impact\non him afterwards, including mentally, and this caused the Applicant to\noverlook the roll out of the licensing scheme in 2022.\n69. The Tribunal also accepts the Applicant’s evidence that he was not on\ntop of his emails, some of which may have gone into his spam folder, and\nfinds that this was exacerbated by the mental health issues he was\nexperiencing.\n70. The Tribunal also accepts the Applicant’s evidence that his post was\nmisdirected on occasions and that he may have missed letters from the\ncouncil due to this factor. Again, his ability to address this issue\neffectively was exacerbated by the mental ill health he was experiencing.\nHowever, the Tribunal cannot determine whether the Applicant received\nthe letter of 22 January 2024.\n71. In any event, the Tribunal accepts that the Applicant had not been aware\nof the scheme until March 2024, when contacted by the Respondent, and\nthat, if he had been, he would have applied for the licence sooner. The\nfact that the Applicant had previously obtained selective licences for his\ntwo other properties under the Respondent’s previous licensing scheme\nis, in the Tribunal’s opinion, strong corroborating evidence of this.\n72. As to whether the Applicant’s lack of knowledge of the scheme due to his\ncircumstances amounts to a reasonable excuse, the Tribunal considers\nthat, as a landlord, it was for the Applicant to make himself aware of all\nhis legal obligations in respect of the Property and the requirements of\n12\n\nthe Respondent. In the absence of additional medical evidence and on\nthe evidence before the Tribunal, the Applicant is an experienced\nlandlord and businessperson and, by October 2023, he was well enough\nto let out the Property (and to sign the tenancy agreement). At that stage,\nthe Applicant should have taken steps to identify what was required of\nhim by law or by way of the Respondent’s housing policy. Alternatively,\nhe could have employed a managing agent to manage the Property for\nhim.\n73. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that the Applicant’s lack of\nknowledge of the scheme due to his medical circumstances and\ndifficulties with communications does not amount to a reasonable\nexcuse.\nImposition and Level of Penalty\n74. Given that the Applicant has not established a reasonable excuse\ndefence, it follows that the Tribunal is satisfied, beyond reasonable\ndoubt, that he has committed an offence under s.95(1).\n75. The Respondent was entitled to consider whether to prosecute the\nApplicant under s.95(5) of the Act or impose a financial penalty under\ns.249A of the 2004 Act. The Tribunal is satisfied that it was appropriate\nfor the Respondent to impose a financial penalty on the Applicant in\nrespect of his failure to licence the Property. The Tribunal must therefore\ndetermine the amount of that penalty.\n76. The Tribunal must make its own determination as to the appropriate\namount of the financial penalty having regard to all the available\nevidence. In doing so, the Tribunal should have regard to the seven\nfactors specified in the HCLG Guidance as being relevant to the level at\nwhich a financial penalty should be set (see paragraph 20 above).\n77. The Tribunal should also have regard to the Respondent’s Policy. As the\nUpper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) observed in Sutton & Another v\nNorwich City Council [2020] UKUT 0090 (LC):\n“It is an important feature of the system of civil penalties that they are\nimposed in the first instance by local housing authorities, and not by\ncourts or tribunals. The local housing authority will be aware of housing\nconditions in its locality and will know if particular practices or\nbehaviours are prevalent and ought to be deterred.”\n78. The Upper Tribunal went on to say that the local authority is well placed\nto formulate its policy and endorsed the view that a tribunal’s starting\npoint in any case should normally be to apply that policy as though it\nwere standing in the local authority’s shoes. It offered the following\nguidance in this regard:\n13\n\n“If a local authority has adopted a policy, a tribunal should consider for\nitself what penalty is merited by the offence under the terms of the\npolicy. If the authority has applied its own policy, the Tribunal should\ngive weight to the assessment it has made of the seriousness of the\noffence and the culpability of the Applicant in reaching its own\ndecision.”\n79. Upper Tribunal guidance on the weight which tribunals should attach to\na local housing authority’s policy (and to decisions taken by the authority\nthereunder) was also given in another decision of the Lands Chamber:\nLondon Borough of Waltham Forest v Marshall & Another [2020]\nUKUT 0035 (LC): whilst a tribunal must afford great respect (and thus\nspecial weight) to the decision reached by the local housing authority in\nreliance upon its own policy, it must be mindful of the fact that it is\nconducting a rehearing, not a review: the tribunal must use its own\njudgment and it can vary such a decision where it disagrees with it,\ndespite having given it that special weight.\n80. Whilst the Tribunal has given very careful consideration to the decision\nreached by the Respondent and the reasons for the same, the Tribunal\ndisagrees with the Respondent’s assessment of the level of culpability\nand harm. The Respondent assessed culpability to be high and harm to\nbe medium.\n81. In respect of culpability, according to the Respondent’s Policy, the\nApplicant must have had “actual foresight of, or wilful blindness to, risk\nof offending but risk nevertheless taken” to be classified as high.\n82. As previously stated, and for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal\naccepts that the Applicant had not been aware of the selective licensing\nscheme until March 2024 and so the Applicant did not have actual\nforesight or wilful blindness of the risk up to March 2024.\n83. In respect of the period between March 2024 and the Applicant making\nthe application on 16 April 2024, the Tribunal does not accept the\nRespondent’s submission that the Applicant failed to engage during that\nperiod; even according to Mr Prescott’s witness evidence, the Applicant\nhad contacted him four times by telephone, voicemail and text message\nduring this time. Mr Prescott’s witness evidence acknowledged that,\nduring those conversations, the Applicant told him he was taking steps\nto enable him to make the application by obtaining new gas and\nelectricity certificates and also that he had been struggling with the\napplication process. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt the Applicant’s\nevidence that he also spoke to the Selective Licensing department during\nthis period but found it difficult to obtain the assistance he required until\nhe eventually spoke to a particular lady who helped him through the\nprocess step by step. The Tribunal finds that this activity by the\nApplicant showed that the Applicant was engaged in the process of\nmaking the application during this time albeit slowly.\n14\n\n84. In relation to the s 16 Notice which the Applicant failed to respond to,\nthe Tribunal has accepted the Applicant’s evidence that his post was\nmisdirected on occasions and that he may have missed letters from the\nRespondent due to this factor and also that his ability to address this\nissue effectively was exacerbated by the mental health issue he was\nexperiencing. However, the Tribunal cannot determine whether the\nApplicant received the letter of 14 March 2024. In any event, the\ndepartment at the Respondent dealing with that matter has not pursued\nseparate proceedings in relation to that offence, and so it would appear\nthat they did accept the Applicant’s explanation as to why he did not\nrespond to the notice. Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider that the\nApplicant’s failure to respond to the s 16 Notice alone is evidence that he\nwas “wilfully blind” to the requirement for a licence.\n85. In relation to the invitation by the Respondent to the Applicant to attend\nan interview under caution dated 15 April 2024, the Tribunal notes that\nthe application for the licence was made on 16 April 2025 and so it does\nnot consider that the question of whether or not the Applicant responded\nto or ignored the letter of 15 April 2025 is a relevant consideration in\nterms of the level of culpability of this offence. That said, for the record,\nthe Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s letter dated 1 May 2024\ncorroborates the Respondent’s version of events. On balance, the\nTribunal prefers the Respondent’s evidence on that basis and suspects\nthat the Applicant may have spoken to the Respondent after he received\nthe latter letter and misremembered the order. However, the Tribunal\nhas no reason to doubt such a confident recollection by the Applicant\nthat he did request an interview by Teams call and finds that it is likely\nthat this proposal was made by the Applicant in the subsequent call.\nFurther, the Tribunal notes again its previous findings in terms of the\ndifficulties which the Applicant was having, generally, in terms of the\nreceipt of his post and the management of his affairs due to his physical\nand mental health.\n86. In relation to the procurement of new gas and electricity certificates for\nthe Property by the Applicant, the Applicant has since produced the\nmissing gas certificates to show that these were obtained at the requisite\ntimes and has also produced further evidence in relation to the condition\nof the electrics at the Property. Therefore, the Tribunal accepts the\nApplicant’s explanation for procuring new certificates simply for speed\nbecause he anticipated it would take longer to find the old ones.\n87. As stated above, the Tribunal accepts the Applicant’s evidence that the\nsurgery had a major impact on his life and that it continued to have a\nsignificant impact on him afterwards, including mentally. This was also\na factor playing into his ability to deal with the application promptly and\neffectively at this time.\n88. Considering the above, whilst the Applicant did not apply for the licence\nimmediately upon being aware of the requirement, the Tribunal finds\nthat he was engaged and taking active steps during this time to achieve\nthat end. Whilst six weeks is not an insignificant delay, in the context of\n15\n\nthe difficulties faced by the Applicant, including mental ill health, it was\nnot a very significant delay. The Tribunal accepts the Applicant’s\nevidence that he dealt with it as best he could and that he believed that\nthe time he took was reasonable to make the application. On that basis,\nthe Tribunal does not consider that there is any evidence that the\nApplicant had “actual foresight of or wilful blindness” to the risk of\noffending during this period.\n89. Under the Respondent’s Policy, culpability is assessed as medium if the\noffence was “committed through act or omission which a person\nexercising reasonable care would not commit” or that “systems were in\nplace to manage risk or comply with legal duties but these were not\nsufficiently adhered to or implemented”. The Tribunal considers that\nthe Applicant’s conduct rightly falls within this category both prior to\nand after March 2024. In particular, after March 2024, during the six\nweek period, the Tribunal considers that the Applicant was in the process\nof making the application in good faith but did not do so quickly enough\nand that a person exercising reasonable care would have submitted the\napplication more quickly and / or he did not adhere to or implement the\nprocess of applying for the licence sufficiently (quickly, in this case).\n90. In respect of harm, under the Respondent’s Policy, to be assessed as\nmedium harm, there must have been “Adverse effect on individual(s)\nbut not amounting to High Harm” or “Medium Risk of adverse harm to\nan individual or low risk of a serious adverse effect” or “The Council’s\nwork as a regulator is undermined by the offenders behaviour” or\n“Consumer / tenant misled”.\n91. There is no suggestion here that there is any actual adverse effect on\nindividuals or a consumer / tenant misled.\n92. The Respondent’s assessment of harm was partially based upon the fact\nthat the Applicant had procured new gas and electricity safety records\nprior to the submission of the licence application and the Respondent’s\ninference that this meant that the Applicant had not complied with his\nlegal obligations prior to this, such that there was a risk of harm to the\ntenants. However, there is no evidence of any risk of harm to the tenants.\nThe Applicant has since provided gas safety certificates for the missing\nyears 2022 and 2023 demonstrating that he had fully complied with his\nobligations in that regard. In relation to the electricity report, the\nApplicant has produced a valid condition report for 2020-2025 also\ndemonstrating that he had fully complied with his obligations in that\nregard. Whilst the 2024 report does indicate on the face of it the\n“replacement of a distribution board”, the Applicant has demonstrated\nthat significant work was undertaken to upgrade the Property in 2020,\nas evidenced by the photographs, and the photographs appear to show\nbefore and after the replacement of the distribution board, and it would\nmake sense for such works to have been undertaken at the same as the\nrefurbishment of the Property. The Applicant has also provided evidence\nfrom an electrician that all was in order in 2023. Therefore, the\n16\n\nRespondent’s inference that the Applicant was aware of safety issues\nrelated to the electrical installations prior to obtaining that later report\nappears to be mere speculation. As set out above, the Tribunal has\naccepted the Applicant’s explanation for procuring new certificates\nsimply for speed because he anticipated it would take longer to find the\nold ones. Based upon the above, the Tribunal determines that the\nRespondent was wrong to assess that there was a medium risk of adverse\nharm or a low risk of a serious adverse effect.\n93. The Respondent’s assessment of harm was also based upon its view that\nits work as a regulator was undermined by the offender’s behaviour. The\nTribunal considers that it cannot be the case that the lack of a licence\napplication alone undermines the role of the regulator, since, if that was\nthe case, this category would apply to every offender. The Respondent\nhas not identified any other reason or evidence to justify this\ncategorisation. Furthermore, the Tribunal noted that Mr Prescot\nconfirmed during his oral evidence that, as far as he was aware, no one\nfrom the Respondent had been to inspect the Property to date, even since\nthe licence had been obtained, demonstrating that the Respondent’s\nwork as a regulator had not be undermined because the Respondent had\nnot sought to use its powers in that regard. In the circumstances, the\nTribunal finds that the Respondent was wrong to assess that the\nApplicant’s conduct had undermined the Respondent’s work as a\nregulator.\n94. Considering the above, the Tribunal determines that, under the\nRespondent’s Policy, the level of harm is low, there being a low risk of\nadverse effect on an individual(s).\n95. Based upon the Tribunal’s findings of culpability and harm, the starting\npoint for the penalty based upon the Respondent’s Policy is £4,500.\nHowever, when the Respondent imposed the penalty, it decided to\nimpose the penalty at the lower end of the band range (which was\n£9,000) on the basis that the Applicant had eventually licensed the\nProperty. The Tribunal considers it is reasonable to adopt the same\napproach here on the same basis, and so the Tribunal takes the starting\npoint as £3750 which is the lowest end of the penalty band range.\n96. The Tribunal then went on to consider the aggravating and mitigating\nfactors considered by the Respondent.\n97. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s assessment that there are no\naggravating factors in the current case.\n98. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent was wrong to consider\nthere were only three mitigating factors (being no relevant unspent\nconvictions or relevant cautions or civil penalties within the last two\nyears). The Respondent has omitted to consider other mitigating factors\nwhich apply in the circumstances. In particular, the Respondent has\nfailed to consider the mitigating circumstances relating to the fact that\nthe Applicant previously correctly licensed two other properties, and\n17\n\nrelating to general good management and the condition of the property,\nwhich considerations the Tribunal considers are provided for in the\nRespondent’s Policy’s list of mitigating factors (which is an non-\nexhaustive list in any event).\n99. The Tribunal considers that there are seven mitigating factors, in\naccordance with the Respondent’s Policy. Those factors are as follows:\na. No relevant unspent previous convictions / good character – The\nApplicant has no previous convictions.\nb. No relevant cautions within the last two years – The Applicant has\nno previous cautions.\nc. No relevant civil penalties within the last two years – The\nApplicant has no previous civil penalties.\nd. One-off event, not commercially motivated – The Applicant has\ntwo other properties in Liverpool and has correctly obtained\nselective licences for those other properties.\ne. Good record of maintaining property – The Applicant has\ndemonstrated a good record for maintaining the Property.\nf. Serious medical condition – the Applicant has provided evidence\nof a serious medical event and the Tribunal has found that, whilst\nthe operation was in 2022, it has had a serious ongoing impact on\nhim including mentally.\ng. Steps taken voluntarily to remedy problem – whilst the Applicant\nhas taken six weeks to submit the application, he has\ndemonstrated his active engagement during this time.\n100. The Respondent’s Policy does not set out a specific % reduction for\nmitigating factors. Given that the Respondent applied a 25% discount for\nthe three mitigating factors it identified, the Tribunal considers that a\ntotal discount in respect of the seven mitigating factors of 50% is\nreasonable and appropriate which reduces the penalty from £3,750 to\n£1,875.\n101. In accordance with the Respondent’s Policy, the Tribunal must review\nthe penalty and, if necessary, adjust the initial amount arrived at to\nensure it fulfils the general principles in the policy. The Respondent’s\nPolicy goes on to state that “the civil penalty should meet, in a fair and\nproportionate way, the objectives of punishment, deterrence and the\nremoval of gain derived through the commission of the offence”.\n102. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s finding that no economic\nbenefit was derived from the offence and so no adjustment was made in\nthat regard.\n103. The Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent’s approach in not making\na reduction for an early admission of guilt. There is no evidence that the\nApplicant has ever denied his failure to comply with the legal obligation\nto obtain the licence and the fact that he has asserted that his personal\ncircumstances gave rise to a reasonable excuse defence does not distract\n18\n\nfrom his acceptance of the breach itself. The Tribunal does not agree with\nMr Prescott’s oral evidence that the only mechanism by which the\nApplicant could have made a valid admission of guilt was at the interview\nunder caution (which the Applicant did not attend) not least because the\ninterview was after the Applicant had submitted the licence application.\nThe Tribunal considers that by acknowledging his oversight and telling\nthe Respondent that he would resolve the issue by applying for the\nlicence (and then by taking active steps to make the application albeit\nslowly) the Applicant did make an early admission. The Tribunal\nconsiders that a reduction of 20% on account of that early admission is\nappropriate which reduces the penalty from £1,875 to £1,500.\n104. The Tribunal finds that a penalty of £1,500 is significant enough to act\nas a punishment to the Applicant as well as a deterrent not just to the\nApplicant, but also to other landlords and potential landlords. The\nTribunal consider that the imposition of a penalty of £1,500 meets the\nobjectives of the Policy in a fair and proportionate way in the\ncircumstances of this case.\nOUTCOME\n105. For the reasons explained above, we vary the decision of the\nRespondent to impose a financial penalty on the Applicant. We do not\nconsider that the Respondent’s Policy was properly applied in respect of\nthe penalty. However, following the Applicant’s appeal to this Tribunal\nand a re-hearing of the Respondent’s decision, the Tribunal has\ndetermined that under the Respondent’s Policy the amount of the\npenalty should be £1,500. The imposition of such a financial penalty is\nappropriate in the circumstances of this case: not only does it reflect the\noffending conduct, but it should also have a suitable punitive and\ndeterrent effect.\n106. Accordingly, we vary the Final Notice. The Applicant must therefore\npay a financial penalty of £1,500 to the Respondent.\nSigned: J. Hadley\nJudge of the First-tier Tribunal\nDate: 25 November 2025\n19"

Beckwith MRICS\nVenue : 10 Alfred Place, London WC1E 7LR\nDate of decision : 27th October 2025\nDECISION\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nDecisions of the tribunal\n(1) The tribunal determines that no service charges are payable by the\nApplicant in respect of the service charges for the years 2020 to 2024\nuntil valid service charge demands for those years are produced by the\nRespondent.\n(2) The tribunal determines that no service charges relating to reserve fund\nor payments on account are payable by the Applicant for the years in\ndispute.\n(3) The tribunal determines that the sum of £410 demanded by the\nRespondent is not a service charge and should be removed from the\nservice charge demands.\n(4) Otherwise the tribunal determines that the service charges demanded\nare payable and reasonable once valid service charge demands are\nproduced. In particular the tribunal determines that\na. the management fees demanded for the years in dispute are\npayable and reasonable.\nb. That the service charges demanded in connection with the garage\nare payable and reasonable.\n(5) The tribunal refuses the Applicant’s Rule 13 application.\n(6) The tribunal makes the determinations as set out under the various\nheadings in this Decision.\n(7) The tribunal makes an order under section 20C of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985 so that none of the landlord’s costs of the tribunal\nproceedings may be passed to the lessees through any service charge.\nThe application\n1. The Applicant seeks a determination pursuant to s.27A of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) as to the amount of service charges\nand (where applicable) administration charges payable by the Applicant\nin respect of the service charge years 2020 – 2025 inclusive.\nThe hearing\n2. The Applicant appeared in person at the hearing and the Respondent was\nrepresented by Mr Stephen Wiles of Prime Property Management. Ms\nCorrea and Dr Contractor, directors of the Respondent, were in\nattendance.\n2\n\n3. The tribunal notes that the Respondent made two applications for strike\nout of the application. The first was on 7th April 2025 on the basis that\nthe application was ‘a fishing expedition’ as the Applicant was\nchallenging every charge from 2019. This application was refused by\nJudge B McQueen who, on 24th April 2025, amended directions and\nprovided an opportunity for the Applicant to submit a revised Scott\nSchedule.\n4. The second was on 23rd June 2025 on the basis that the revised Scott\nSchedule failed to specify the specific charges that are in dispute. Judge\nDutton refused the strike out application finding that the Scott Schedule,\nwhilst not in standard form raised failures to comply with lease terms\nand statutory obligations. It was therefore able to stand as a statement of\ncase.\n5. The bundles in this application were received very late. The Applicant\nsubmitted the bundle on 21st August 2025. The Respondent complained\nthat it did not contain documentation from the Respondent that were\nnecessary for its case. The Respondent therefore provided a bundle on\nthe morning of the hearing.\n6. Despite the late provision of documentation, the tribunal determined,\nwith the agreement of the parties, that it was in the interests of justice\nthat the hearing took place on the day listed. It had sufficient information\non which to decide the application.\nThe background\n7. The property which is the subject of this application is a one bedroom\nflat on the second floor of a purpose-built block with the benefit of an in-\nblock garage.\n8. Neither party requested an inspection, and the tribunal did not consider\nthat one was necessary, nor would it have been proportionate to the\nissues in dispute.\n9. The Applicant holds a long lease of the property which requires the\nlandlord to provide services and the tenant to contribute towards their\ncosts by way of a variable service charge. The specific provisions of the\nlease and will be referred to below, where appropriate.\nThe issues\n10. At the start of the hearing the parties identified the relevant issues for\ndetermination as follows:\n3\n\n(i) The payability and/or reasonableness of service charges for years\n2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, actual charges, and 2024 and 2025,\nestimated charges. The applicant challenges in particular\na. The service charges for roof, cladding, external works and\nFlat 5 internal works\nb. Whether service charge demands comply with the\nstatutory requirements\n(ii) The payability of £410 insurance shortfall\n(iii) The payability and reasonableness of management fees\n(iv) Whether service charges are payable in relation to Garage 7\n(v) The applicant makes an application under Rule 13\n11. Having heard evidence and submissions from the parties and considered\nall of the documents provided, the tribunal has made determinations on\nthe various issues as follows.\nThe reasonableness and payability of the service charges demanded\nThe Applicant’s arguments\n12. He says that the lease lacks clarity regarding the service charge\nmechanism. It contains no provisions for a reserve or sinking fund, no\nframework for interim service charge payments and no mechanism for\nissuing balancing charges, demanding shortfall payments or arranging\nrepayments.\n13. The Applicant refers the tribunal to a decision made by the tribunal in\n2017 which confirmed that the lease does not authorise advance service\ncharges or a sinking fund.\n14. The Applicant says that the Respondent has failed to implement planned\nmaintenance relying on piecemeal repairs since 2001. The grounds have\nbeen neglected, and storm and cladding damage has not been properly\ndealt with. The Applicant says that demands for such reactive works are\nnot reasonably incurred.\n15. The Applicant also says that the Respondent has failed to provide annual\nbudgets, that the accounts submitted are neither signed nor audited and\nthat the Respondent has failed to comply with the tribunal’s directions\non disclosure.\n4\n\n16. The Respondent says that the Applicant has failed to identify costs that\nare in dispute. It also says that annual accounts have been provided by\nthe landlord as per Clause 5(h) of the lease. The Respondent points out\nthat there is no requirement to prepare a budget and there is no\nrequirement for the accounts to be audited.\n17. The Respondent says that its repairing obligations are dependent upon\nlessees paying all service charges due as per Clause 4(f) of the lease.\n18. The Respondent agrees that the lease does not make the landlord’s role\nstraightforward, particularly given its nature as a share of the freehold\ncompany.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n19. The tribunal determines that no service charges demanded prior to 2025\nare payable until statutory compliant service charge demands are\nproduced by the Respondent.\n20. Service charges are not payable on account, nor are service charges\npayable in respect of a sinking/reserve fund.\n21. Otherwise, and once statutorily compliant demands have been produced,\nthe service charges are payable and reasonable.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n22. The tribunal noted that whilst it had evidence that the service charge\ndemands served by Prime Property Management complied with the\nstatutory requirements, it had no evidence that service charge demands\nserved prior to the appointment of Prime Property Management did\ncomply.\n23. Therefore the tribunal determines that until the Respondent produces to\nthe Applicant service charge demands in the correct statutory form for\nthe service charge years in dispute prior to 2025 or re-serves its service\ncharge demands in the correct statutory form no service charges are\npayable.\n24. The tribunal agrees with the Applicant that the Respondent is unable to\ncharge in advance or to operate a sinking fund as there is no provision in\nthe lease for such charges. Therefore the service charge demands require\nrecalculation to remove these amounts and any associated\nadministrative fees.\n25. The tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Applicant has failed to\nmake its case in connection with the quality of works etc and failed to\n5\n\nitemise costs in dispute, and that therefore the sums demanded in\nconnection with those works, subject to the service of valid service charge\ndemands, is payable and reasonable.\nThe payability of the £410 insurance shortfall\n26. The Applicant argues that he repaired a leak at a cost of £189. The\nRespondent then charged £410 via fire safety contractor.\n27. The Respondent says that the sum of £410 is a shortfall in an insurance\nclaim and not a service charge item applied to the Applicant. The charge\nfollowed the Applicant’s flat being subject to damage following a water\nleak and the insurance payout did not fully cover the costs of the damage.\nIn these circumstances the lessee must cover the shortfall.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n28. The tribunal determines that sum of £410 falls outside of its jurisdiction\nas it is not a service charge but a personal liability of the Applicant\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n29. The tribunal accepts the explanation of the Respondent that this charge\nis a result of a leak from the Applicant’s flat into the flat below. The\ndamage was largely covered by an insurance payment but the Applicant\nremains liable for the excess.\n30. This charge is not however a service charge but a personal liability. The\nmonies should be deducted from the service charge account and any fees\nadded to the account as a result of late payment etc should be deducted.\n31. The tribunal notes that the Applicant has offered to pay £300 of this sum.\nIt is for the Respondent to decide on next steps including legal action in\nthe County Court where of course legal fees and interest charges may be\nadded to the claim.\nManagement fees\n32. The Applicant argues that management of the property has been\nsubstandard and that specific management responsibilities have not\nbeen fulfilled.\n33. The Respondent says that the annual charges since 2020 have been\n£1200 which equates to £200 per unit which is at the lower end of the\nmarket rate for management.\n6\n\n34. The Respondent also says that the market has been tested for\nmanagement fees.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n35. The tribunal determines that the amount payable in respect of\nmanagement fees is reasonable and payable.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n36. The Applicant produced no evidence to support his allegations of poor\nstandards of service.\n37. The tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the amounts demanded\nare reasonable.\nGarage 7\n38. The Applicant explained that Garage 7 was bought by the company in\n1985. The Applicant argues that Garage 7 has been insured at\nleaseholders’ expense but has generated no income. The Applicant has\nurged repair, but no action has been taken. Service charge budgets for\n2025 include £520 for rubbish clearance for the garage. Statutory\naccounts list freehold and garage as a depreciating asset but service\ncharge accounts conceal it. The Respondent has breached its duty by\nfailing to maintain, disclose or generate income from Garage 7. The\nApplicant’s main point is that as he does not own the garage and is\nunable to use it he should not be liable for its maintenance, insurance or\nmanagement charges.\n39. The Respondent says that the lease allows it to charge these sums. It\nrefers the tribunal to the Fifth Schedule of the lease.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n40. The tribunal determines that the service charges demanded in\nconnection with Garage 7 are reasonable and payable.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n41. The obligation to pay service charges is set out in the lease agreement. In\nthis case the service charge obligation includes all buildings on the\nproperty enjoyed and used by the Lessee in common with the owners and\nlessees of the other residential flats and premises comprised in the\nproperty. Garage 7 is part of the property enjoyed and used in common\nas described in the lease and shown on the lease plan.\n7\n\nThe application under Rule 13\n42. The Applicant argues that the Respondent has committed many\nprocedural failings, with late and missing Scott Schedules and\ncontradictory witness statements. He asks for £229 for his time and £90\nper hour for his assistant’s time. The total comes to £2295 plus direct\nrepair costs plus rent loss.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n43. The tribunal determines to dismiss the application under Rule 13.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n44. Willow Court Management C v Alexander [2016] UKUT 290 sets out the\napproach of the tribunal to applications under Rule 13 of its procedural\nrules. There are three stages to the decision-making process. The first\nis that the tribunal has to decide whether the party acted unreasonably,\nthe second is whether a costs order should be made given any\nunreasonable conduct found, and thirdly the tribunal should determine\nthe terms of any order. The case makes it clear that the hurdle for\nunreasonable conduct is high.\n45. The tribunal determines that the conduct of the Respondent with regard\nto any procedural issues was not vexatious nor was it designed to harass\nwhich are the tests of unreasonable conduct. There were delays, but\nthese were explained by the Respondent, and several of the delays were\ndue to lack of information or cooperation from the Applicant.\nApplication under s.20C\n46. At the hearing, the Applicant applied for an order under section 20C of\nthe 1985 Act. Having heard the submissions from the parties and taking\ninto account the determinations above, in particular in relation to the\nsinking fund and payments in advance which have already been the\nsubject of a tribunal decision, the tribunal determines that it is just and\nequitable in the circumstances for an order to be made under section 20C\nof the 1985 Act, so that the Respondent may not pass any of its costs\nincurred in connection with the proceedings before the tribunal through\nthe service charge.\nName: Judge H Carr Date: 27th October 2025\n8\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n9"

      "text": "FIRST - TIER TRIBUNAL\nPROPERTY CHAMBER\n(RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY)\nCase Reference : MAN/00CH/HIN/2019/0003\nProperty : 1-8 Dykes Way, Gateshead, NE10 8QL\nApplicant : Proxima GR Properties Ltd\nRepresentative : Mr. M. McIntosh –\nEstates & Management Ltd\nRespondent : Gateshead Council\nInterested Parties : Leaseholders – see Annexe A\nType of Application : Housing Act 2004 – Schedule 1\nParagraph 10 (1)\nTribunal Members : Mrs A Rawlence MRICS\nMr W Reynolds MRICS\nDate of Determination 23 May 2019\nDate of Decision 29 May 2019\nDECISION\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019\n\nOrder: The Appeal against the improvement notice served on the\nApplicant in relation to 1-8 Dykes Way, Gateshead is upheld.\nApplication.\n1. The Applicant appealed Schedule 1, Paragraph 10 of the Housing Act 2004\n(“the Act”) against an improvement notice relating to 1-8 Dykes Way,\nGateshead NE10 8QL (“the Property”). The notice was served by Gateshead\nCouncil, the local housing authority (“the Authority/Respondent”). It is dated\n20 December 2018 and is made under sections 11 of the Act, requiring certain\nworks to be carried out to the Property to remedy hazards referred to in the\nNotice. The Appeal lodged on behalf of the Appellant is dated 10 January\n2019, which is within the 21 day appeal period provided for under Paragraph\n14(1) of the Act.\n2. The provisions of Paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 provide for the person on whom\nan improvement notice is served to have the right to appeal to a Residential\nProperty Tribunal.\n3. Paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 states:\n(1) An appeal made be made by a person under paragraph 10 on the\nground that one or more other persons, as an owner or owners of the\nspecified premises, ought to-\n(a) take the action concerned or\n(b) pay the whole of part of the cost of taking that action.\n4. Directions as to the future conduct of the appeal was given by Tribunal Judge\nJ Holbrook dated 15 March 2019. Both parties agreed to a paper\ndetermination and the matter was listed for consideration by the Tribunal.\n5. As the appeal concerns the identity of the correct recipient of the notice and\nnot the contents of the Improvement Notice, the property was not inspected.\n6. However, the Tribunal notes that the notice related to inadequate lighting\nwithin the common areas.\nThe Law\n7. The law relating to the service and content of Improvement Notices as they\nrelate to a situation where there is a category 1 hazard is set out in Sections 11-\n13 Housing Act 2004 and appears below:\n8. Section 11 Improvement notices relating to category 1 hazards: duty of\nauthority to serve notice\n(1) If—\n(a) the local housing authority are satisfied that a category 1\nhazard exists on any residential premises, and\n2\n\n(b) no management order is in force in relation to the premises\nunder Chapter 1 or 2 of Part 4,\nServing an improvement notice under this section in respect of the hazard\nis a course of action available to the authority in relation to the hazard for\nthe purposes of section 5 (category 1 hazards: general duty to take\nenforcement action)\n(2) An improvement notice under this section is a notice requiring the\nperson on whom it is served to take such remedial action in respect of\nthe hazard concerned as is specified in the notice in accordance with\nsubsections (3) to (5) and section 13.\n(3) The notice may require remedial action to be taken in relation to the\nfollowing premises-\n(a) …\n(b) if those premises are one or more flats, it may require such\naction to be taken in relation to the building containing the flat\nor flats (or any part of the building) or any external common\nparts.\n(c) if those premises are the common parts of a building\ncontaining one or more flats, it may require such action to be\ntaken in relation to the building (or any part of the building)\nor any external common parts.\n9. Section 4 of Schedule 1 of the Act states:\nService of improvement notices: common parts\n4 (1) This paragraph applies where any specified premises in the case of\nan improvement notice are\n(a) common parts of a building containing one or more flats; or\n(b) any part of such a building which does not consist of residential\npremises.\n(2) The local housing authority must serve the notice on a person who—\n(a) is an owner of the specified premises concerned, and\n(b) in the authority’s opinion ought to take the action specified in\nthe notice.\n(3) For the purposes of this paragraph a person is an owner of any\ncommon parts of a building if he is an owner of the building or part\nof the building concerned, or (in the case of external common parts)\nof the particular premises in which the common parts are comprised.\n3\n\nSubmissions\n10. Both parties made submissions which were copied to the Tribunal and to the\nother party.\n11. The Applicant contended that the notice should have been served upon the\nlong leaseholders who, collectively, were demised the entirety of the property.\n12. The Respondent did not dispute that the long leaseholders of the 8 flats also\nfell under the definition of owner at Section 262 (7) b of the Act. However,\nThe Respondent relied upon Section 4(2) (b) of Schedule 1 of the Act and\nconsidered that the freeholder of the property ought to take the action\nspecified in the notice.\n13. Both parties referred to various Clauses of the Lease (see below).\n14. The Respondent also referred to extracts from the Upper Tribunal decision in\nHastings Borough Council v Braear Developments Limited [2015] UKUT 145\n(LC). The Respondent acknowledged however (Paragraph 16 of their case)\nthat in the Braear case, the argument was based on a different set of facts and\nasserts that the crucial difference between this appeal and the Braear case was\nthat there is no RTM company.\n15. The Respondent suggested that if an RTM company was in place, it may be\nthat a notice would have been served on the individual leaseholders and that\nin the absence of such a company there was a simple contractual arrangement\nbetween the freeholders and leaseholders at paragraph 2 of the Fifth Schedule\nwhich allowed the Appellant to comply with the improvement notice. It\nfurther suggested that the most practical method of ensuring compliance with\nthe notice was for the Appellant to be responsible for the remedial works with\nthe Appellant recovering the cost of those works from the leaseholders.\nThe Lease\n16. The Tribunal were provided with a copy lease in respect of Studio Solo Flat 6\non the first floor and proceeded on the basis that all of the leases for the\nproperty are in similar form save as to the actual premises demised.\n17. The Applicant contended that the lessees were responsible for maintaining\nlighting to the common areas. In particular, the Applicant identified that (at\nparagraph 5 of the fifth schedule to the leases), the lessees covenant ‘to\nmaintain in efficient working order a sufficient electric light of not less than\nsixty watts in the passage outside the Studio Solo Flat included in the\ndemised premises in a position designated by the lessor for the benefit of\npersons using the block and keep the same at all times on electricity supply’.\n4\n\n18. The Respondent referred to paragraph 2 of the Fifth Schedule to the leases\nwhich provides as follows:\n‘To permit the Lessor or its agent to enter the demised premises upon prior\nreasonable notice being given (except in case of emergency) to view the state\nof repair and condition thereof and to leave on the demised premises notices\nin writing to the Lessee of all defects and wants of reparation then and there\nfound which the Lessee is liable to make good under the covenants herein\ncontained and if the Lessee shall not proceed diligently within three months\nof any such notice to execute and complete such outstanding works to permit\nthe Lessor to execute such repairs the cost of so doing to be payable by the\nLessee on demand and if not so paid to be recoverable as if the same were\nrent in arrear’.\n19. The Applicant suggested that there was no state of dis-repair when\ncontrasting the lighting provided in the common areas with that which was\nprovided when the building was constructed and that the Applicant effectively\nconsidered that paragraph 2 of the Fifth Schedule limits the Lessor’s rights to\na right to execute repairs.\n20. The Respondent further contended (at paragraph 13 of their case) that the\nlease does not give the individual leaseholders any rights to enter the other\ndemised premises in the block to effect the works and that there is no\ncontractual mechanism for the leaseholders to require each other to comply\nwith the notice or the repair covenant.\n21. The Applicant disagreed with the Respondents contention at Paragraph 13 of\ntheir case and referred to paragraph 4 of the First Schedule to the leases which\nprovides the lessees with:\n‘Such rights of access to and entry upon the other common parts in the block\nand the other Studio Solo Flats as are necessary for the proper performance\nof the Lessees obligations hereunder’.\n22. The Applicant also referred to Clause 4 of the leases which provides that:\n‘The Lessee hereby covenants with the Lessor and with the lessees of the other\nStudio Solo Flats comprised in the block that the Lessee will observe and\nperform the obligations on the part of the Lessee set out in the Fifth Schedule\nhereto’.\nTribunal’s Deliberations\n23. The Tribunal have considered the terms of the leases carefully. The Tribunal\nconsider that, prima facie, the Lessees are obliged to maintain sufficient\nlighting to the passages outside the Studio Solo Flats. The Tribunal further\nconsiders that the Respondents assertion at paragraph 13 of their case that\nthe lease does not give the individual leaseholders any rights to enter the other\ndemised premises in the block to effect the works and that there is no\ncontractual mechanism for the leaseholders to require each other to comply\nwith the notice or the repair covenant is not correct.\n5\n\n24. The Tribunal take the view that on construction of the lease, the owners who\n‘ought to take the action specified in the notice’ are the lessees of the flats.\n25. The Tribunal has also had regard to the comments made by Martyn Rodger,\nDeputy President of the Upper Tribunal in respect of the Braear case in which\n(at paragraph 59 of the transcript), he notes:\n‘There may therefore be circumstances in which it would be open to a local\nhousing authority to serve an improvement notice in relation to the common\nparts of a building either on the freeholder or on some or all of the lessees of\nflats in the building. It will be a matter for consideration in each case which\nof these owners “ought to take the actions specified in the notice”. In\nreaching a conclusion on that question a local housing authority will wish to\nhave regard to the practicality of compliance with the notice’.\n26. The Tribunal has therefore also considered whether the Respondents case\nthat the most practical method of ensuring compliance with the notice is for\nthe Appellant to be responsible for the remedial works with the Appellant\nrecovering the cost of those works from the leaseholders under the provisions\nof paragraph 2 of the Fifth Schedule to the leases.\n27. The Tribunal notes however that to avail itself of this provision, the Applicant\nwould have to first inspect and serve notice on the lessees of the wants of\nrepair or defects and, having done so, would have to allow the lessees a period\nof 3 months to undertake the necessary work before it was able to undertake\nthe works itself. The Tribunal finds this timescale to be inconsistent with the\nrequirements of the Notice served on the Applicant on 20th December 2018\nwhich required the remedial action to be started by 28th January 2019 and\ncompleted by no later than 25th February 2019.\nDecision\n28. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the owners who ‘ought to take the\naction specified in the notice’ are the lessees and that the Applicants rights\nunder paragraph 2 of the Fifth Schedule to the leases do not confer any degree\nof practicality for compliance with the notice. The appeal is allowed.\n29. If either party is dissatisfied with this decision, they may apply for permission\nto appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber). Any such application must\nbe made to the First-tier Tribunal within 28 days of this decision (Rule 52 (2))\nof The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules\n2013.\n30.

Pursuant to section 107(1) Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act\n2002 (‘CLRA’), the Tribunal Orders the Respondent to remedy it’s\ndefault in compliance with section 93 CLRA (Duty to provide\ninformation) by sending to the Applicant by 4pm on 11 December\n2025 the following:\n(a) (i) A copy of the buildings insurance policy or summary of\ncover, a copy of the current schedule and evidence of\npayment of the premium for the current year\n(ii) Brief details of the claims history for the last 3 years\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2025\n\n(b) A copy of the Financial Statements for the year to December\n2024\n(c) Interim accounts for the period from December 2024 to 25 July\n2025\n(d) A list of service charges due from or held on account in respect of\neach flat\n(e) Details of any surplus monies held on account of the service\ncharges\n(f) The percentages of service charges payable in respect of all the\nflats contained at the premises and to:\n(i) supply the Company to the address stated above with a\ncopy of any document containing the said information in\nreadily intelligible form, and\n(ii) permit any person authorised to act on behalf of the\nCompany at any reasonable time to inspect any document\nin your possession.\n2. For the avoidance of doubt, the date of acquisition of the right to\nmanage was 25 July 2025, and references to previous or current years\nin paragraph 1. above are all by reference to the service charge year in\nwhich that date fell.\n3. By section 107(3) CLRA this Order is enforceable in the County Court\nas an order of that court.\n4. Unless the Respondent complies with paragraph 1 above, the Tribunal\nwill transfer the matter to the County Court at Wandsworth, for\nconsideration of appropriate enforcement pursuant to section 107(3)(b)\nCLRA.\nREASONS\nA. This order should be read together with the order and reasons given in\nthe connected application for a determination of accrued uncommitted\nservice charge funds, of the same date.\nB. A no-fault right to manage (‘RTM’) claim notice in respect of the\nproperty 105 Hamilton Road, London SW19 1JG (‘the premises’), itself\ndated 13 March 2025, was given to Assethold Limited, its\nrepresentative company Eagerstates Limited, and to Mr Ronni Gurvits\nof Eagerstates Limited by first-class post on 14 March 2025.\nC. By email dated 15 March 2025, Scott Cohen solicitors (on behalf of the\nRespondent) made a number of enquiries that were responded to on 27\n2\n\nMarch 2025 by the Applicant’s then-representative, The Leasehold\nAdvice Centre. No counternotice was served.\nD. On 30 May 2025, the Applicant gave notice to the Respondent under\nsection 93 CLRA (‘the section 93 notice’) that it required the documents\nlisted in that notice, in view of the acquisition of the right to manage\nthe premises due to take place on 25 July 2025.\nE. Acquisition of the RTM took effect as a matter of law on 25 July 2025\n(section 90 CLRA).\nF. By email of 5 August 2025, the Tribunal received an application from\nMs Erica Fallios, a Director of the Applicant. The Respondent was given\nnotice of the application by an email from the Tribunal dated 13 August\n2025 at 12:18pm.\nG. By that application, the Applicant sought, amongst other things, an\norder pursuant to section 107 CLRA, in respect of those\ndocuments/information required in the section 93 notice.\nH. On 8 September 2025, the Tribunal gave Directions for both parties in\nrelation to the application, by a single set of directions covering both\nthe section 93 application and an associated application under section\n94(3) for a determination of the sum of accrued uncommitted service\ncharges payable by the Respondent to the Applicant. Those Directions\nshould be read together with this Order.\nI. By paragraph (8) of those Directions, the Tribunal identified the\ndocuments sought by the Applicant by its section 93 Notice given to the\nRespondent on 30 May 2025, to which the Applicant received no\nresponse.\nJ. By direction 2 of those Directions, the Tribunal required the\nRespondent to give disclosure to the Applicant of documents including\nthose set out by the Applicant identified in paragraph (8) therein.\nK. The Respondent failed to comply.\nL. By notice of intention to make an order pursuant to section 107(2)\n(‘Notice of Intention’), for the reasons set out in that order, the\nTribunal made an unless order in which it directed the Respondent to\ncomply with the direction given on 8 September within 14 days, failing\nwhich an order under section 107(1) and (3) would be made in respect\nof the section 93 application.\nM. The Respondent replied purporting to be confused. By order dated 6\nNovember 2025, the Tribunal extended time for compliance with the\nNotice of Intention to Thursday 13 November 2025.\nN. The Respondent has failed to comply.\n3\n\nO.

Aycliffe Technology Limited (“the Landlord”) has sought payment from\nMarzena Grzelakowska (“the Tenant”) of charges totalling £600 relying on the\nfollowing tenant’s covenant in her lease of 11 Wolsey Grove, Esher, Surrey KT10 8NU\n(“the Flat”):\n“To pay all costs charges and expenses (including solicitor’s costs and surveyor’s\nfees) incurred by the landlord for the purpose of or incidental to the preparation\nand service of a notice under section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 or any\nsimilar enactment from time to time replacing such section notwithstanding\nforfeiture may be avoided otherwise than by relief granted by the Court”.\n2. These charges are disputed by the Tenant and she makes this application\nunder Paragraph 5 of Schedule 11 to the Commonhold & Leasehold Reform Act 2002\nasking the Tribunal to determine their payability.\nFactual background\n3. The Tenant is the current lessee of the Flat under the lease dated 21st\nSeptember 1978 (“the Lease”). The Lease is for a term of 125 years from 25th March\n1978 at an annual ground rent of, for the second 25 years, £50 payable in advance in\n2 instalments on 25 March and 29 September. The Lease also reserves as additional\nrent a sum equal to one quarter of the amount spent by the Landlord in insuring the\nbuilding of which the Flat forms part.\n4. The Lease contains a forfeiture clause, being clause 5, and clause 2(e) is a\ncovenant for the payment by the tenant of costs in the form quoted at paragraph 1\nabove.\n5. The Tenant was late in paying ground rent and insurance rent treated as\nfalling due on or around 25 March 2016 and 25 March 2017.\n6. Mr Jon Watt, a director of the Landlord, was in the habit of sending out\nannual demands a little after the March quarter day demanding insurance rent as\nwell as ground rent in an annual sum; being content to receive the ground rent\ninstalment for the period from 29 September of the previous year in arrears. His\ndemands in respect of the March 2016 and 2017 quarter days in a total sum of\n£759.84 were settled by way of 2 payments made by the Tenant on about 2 May 2017\nand 19 March 2018. The Tribunal observes that, on the face of it, there appears to\nhave been overpayment of rent. The demands refer to an annual ground rent of £60\nwhereas the rent reserved by the Lease is currently an annual sum of £50.\n2\n\n7. Some efforts having been made by Mr Watt to chase payment, including\nseeking payment from the Tenant’s mortgagee, Mr Watt then made the following\ndemand by email of 1 April 2018:\n“Unfortunately as you’re aware I have expended time and effort in managing your\naccount for which I will need reimbursing …\n1. 1 hr of solicitor time - £250 + VAT\n2. My time costed at £100/hr – 2 hrs correspondence, 1hr misc. including visits to\nGascoigne-Pees = £300\nOutstanding amount £600 total.”\nGascoigne-Pees were estate agents visited by Mr Watt seeking an address for the\nTenant.\nGrounds of challenge\n8. The following grounds of challenge to the payability of the charges can be\ncollected from the application and subsequent statements of case:\n8.1 They are not payable under the terms of the Lease.\n8.2 No summary of rights and obligations was sent with the demand for the\ncharges.\n8.3 The charges are unreasonable.\n9. The Landlord’s response to the application has been by way of highlighting\nlate payment of rent by the Tenant and explaining the resulting work done by him for\nthe Landlord.\nLaw\n10. By paragraph 5 of Schedule 11 to the 2002 Act, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to\ndetermine the payability of an “administration charge”.\n11. An administration charge as defined by paragraph 1 of Schedule 11 includes\n“an amount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to the rent\nwhich is payable, directly or indirectly … (c) in respect of a failure by the tenant to\nmake a payment by the due date to the landlord …, or (d) in connection with a\nbreach (or alleged breach) of a covenant or condition in his lease.”.\n12. A “’variable administration charge’ means an administration charge\npayable by a tenant which is neither (a) specified in his lease, nor (b) calculated in\naccordance with a formula specified in his lease” – paragraph 1 of Schedule 11. Such\na charge is, by virtue of paragraph 2 of Schedule 11, payable only to the extent that it\nis reasonable.\n3\n\n13. As reflected in the decision of the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) in\nBarrett v Robinson [2014] UKUT 322 (LC) charges made under covenants of the sort\nrelied on in this case are variable administration charges.\n14. It is also plain from Barrett v Robinson that a distinction is to be drawn\nbetween covenants concerned only with costs associated with forfeiture and those\nwhich are more general indemnity covenants.\n15. Here, the covenant is concerned solely with costs “incurred by the landlord\nfor the purpose of or incidental to the preparation and service of a notice under\nsection 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925”. Accordingly, the following statement of\nMartin Rodger QC in Barrett v Robinson (at para.52) is applicable to the covenant in\nthis case: “A landlord which does not in fact contemplate the service of a statutory\nnotice when expenditure is incurred, will not be able to rely on a clause such as\ncl.4(14) as providing a contractual right to recover its costs.”\n16. As to the importance of a statement of rights and obligations, subparagraph\n4(1) of Schedule 11 provides that “A demand for the payment of an administration\ncharge must be accompanied by a summary of the rights and obligations of tenants\nof dwellings in relation to administration charges”. A failure to comply with such\nrequirement means that the charge is not payable; subparagraph (2) providing that\n“A tenant may withhold payment of an administration charge which has been\ndemanded from him if subparagraph (1) is not complied with in relation to the\ndemand”.\nDecision\n17. Starting with the first ground of challenge, the question is whether the charges\nraised are payable given the terms of the covenant at clause 2(e) of the Lease set out\nin full at paragraph 1 above.\n18. On the papers before the Tribunal, the charges are not within the scope of the\ncovenant and so are not recoverable.\n19. There is no evidence at all to suggest that the work of Mr Watt or his solicitor\nwas done with a view to forfeiture. On the contrary, there is no mention at all of\nforfeiture in Mr Watt’s correspondence, his statements of case to the Tribunal or the\ninvoice from his solicitor describing the work said to have been carried out. Rather,\nall efforts seem to have been directed at chasing payment. But chasing payment is\nnot a step taken for the purposes of or incidental to the preparation and service of a\ns.146 notice. It is not an act done with a view to forfeiture.\n4\n\n20. There is a further reason why the sum of £300 charged in respect of Mr Watt’s\ntime is not within the scope of the covenant. The covenant requires payment of costs\n“incurred”. And there is no evidence that the Landlord incurred a cost of £300 by\nway of payment to Mr Watt.\n21. There must also be significant doubt as to whether the sum of £250 plus VAT\ncharged in respect of the solicitor was in fact incurred by the Landlord. In that\nrespect there are the following oddities:\n21.1 The invoice from the solicitor, Mr A Adoki, is not a VAT invoice and yet Mr\nWatt sought for the Landlord payment of £250 plus VAT.\n21.2 The invoice has the following remarkable title: “Professional Fee’s of Mr\nA.Adok1”. The solicitor appears to have spelled his own name incorrectly on an\napparently standard invoice by using a digit, and described his charges as “Fee’s”.\n21.3 Whereas the invoice is for “time spent 1 hour”, Mr Watt’s statement to the\nTribunal dated 21 July 2018 gives, as part of a detailed breakdown of the costs\nsought, the time spent as 45 minutes.\n21.4 It is, in any event, difficult to see how 1 hour could be spent discussing non-\npayment of 2 demands for ground and insurance rent totalling £759.84.\n22. However, it would not be right to find on a paper determination that this cost\nwas not in fact incurred. Had this issue been determinative of the case, there would\nneed to be a hearing.\n23. Turning to the second ground of challenge, there is no suggestion in the\npapers before the Tribunal that a summary of rights and obligations as required by\nparagraph 4 of Schedule 11 to the 2002 Act was sent with the demand for the charges\nof £600. The consequence is that, even if they had fallen within the scope of the\ncovenant, they would not be payable.\n24. As to the third ground of challenge, namely reasonableness or otherwise of the\ncharges, it is not necessary given the conclusions above, and would be highly\nartificial, to attempt a decision on that question. Questions of reasonableness are\nfact sensitive. Here, where the costs were not incurred for the purposes stated in the\ncovenant and were not, at least in part and perhaps in whole, incurred at all, it is not\nthe right course to embark upon a determination of whether, had they been, they\nwould have been reasonable.\n5\n\nCosts and fees in the Tribunal\n25. The Tenant’s application extends to asking for an order reducing or\nextinguishing any liability she may have under the Lease to pay the costs of these\nproceedings. The Tribunal may make such an order under paragraph 5A of Schedule\n11 to the 2002 Act.\n26. It is just and equitable to make such an order in this case. The Tenant has\nbeen entirely successful. She should not have to bear, under the Lease or otherwise,\nthe Landlord’s costs of resisting her challenge to its charges.\n27. It is also right that, having been successful, she should have an order under\nrule 13(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules\n2013 for the Landlord to reimburse her fee for this application to the Tribunal. That\nfee was £100.\nSummary\n28. From the above, the Tribunal:\n28.1 Determines that the charges of £600 made by the Landlord relying on clause\n2(e) of the Lease are not payable.\n28.2 Orders that any liability of the Tenant under the Lease for the costs of these\nproceedings is extinguished.\n28.3 Orders that the Landlord must reimburse the Tenant the sum of £100, being\nher fee for this application to the Tribunal\nJudge A Johns QC\n30 November 2018\nAppeal\n(1) A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing with the case.\n(2) The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the Tribunal\nsends to the person making the application written reasons for the decision.\n(3) If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28 day time limit,\nthe person shall include with the application for permission to appeal a\nrequest for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the 28\nday time limit. The Tribunal will then decide whether to extend time or not to\nallow the application for permission to appeal to proceed.\n6\n\n(4) The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state the result\nthe party making the application is seeking.\n7"

By an Order dated 30 September 2022 of District Judge Davies sitting\nin the county court at Edmonton stated:\n1.

In support of the application to determine the value of the freehold\ninterest appropriate premium payable for a lease extension and the\nterms of transfer, the tribunal was provided with a bundle of 210 pages.\nThis included the valuation report of Mr Andrew Cohen MRICS of\nTalbots Surveyors & Valuers dated 06/03/2023 in which he concluded\nthe premium payable is £94,310 plus £100 in respect of Appurtenant\nLand.\n3. In his report, Mr Cohen gave evidence of his experience at dealing with\nsimilar valuations and his obligation to the tribunal as an expert\nwitness. The subject property is a Victorian three-storey centre-\nterraced house converted into three flats of varying sizes, one on each\nfloor. Each flat is held on a lease for a term of 99-years from 25 March\n1988 with 65.25 years remaining as at the valuation date. Ground rent\n2\n\nis £120 per annum per flat rising to £240 for the final 33 years of the\nterm.\n4. In his report, Mr Cohen adopted the following dates and figures:\nValuation date: 22 December 2021 being the date the application\nwas made to the county court.\nCapitalisation rate: 6% as doubling of ground rent for remaining\nthirty-three years would be attractive to the\nhypothetical third-party investor.\nValue of each flat on a share of freehold basis:\nGround Floor Flat: £350,000\nFirst Floor Flat: £320,000\nSecond Floor Flat: £280,000 (not participating)\nIn reaching these values, Mr Cohen relied upon a\nnumber of comparable properties in the same local\narea.\nDeferment rate: 5% relying on Earl Cadogan v Sportelli and\nanother [2008] UKHL 71\nRelativity: 81.8% relying on average of Gerald Eve (2016)\nGraph and Savills Unenfranchiseable; Deritend\nInvestments (Birkdale) Ltd v Treskonova [2020]\nUKUT 165 (LC)\nHope Value: £10% (nominal value only).\nValue of appurtenant land:\n£100 (includes part of the front garden and\nnominal value only).\nPremium: £94,310 plus £100 for appurtenant land\nThe respondents’ case\n3\n\n5. No evidence was received from any of the respondents by the tribunal\nThe tribunal’s decision and reasons\n6. In the absence of any objections or evidence to counter the report and\nopinion of Mr Cohen, the tribunal accepts his report as providing an\nadequate and reasonable valuation of the subject Property and\ncalculation of the premium payable.\n7. The tribunal finds Mr Cohen relied upon a reasonable selection of\ncomparable properties at 15 Elm Court, 15-16 Bruce Grove, N17 6UU;\n66a Bruce Grove, N17 6RN; 51 Bruce Castle Road, N17 8NL; 4b Linley\nRoad, N17 6RP and 57 The Avenue, N17 6TB. The tribunal also\naccepted Mr Cohen’s adoption of the other values set out above was\nappropriate and in accordance with current case law and found no\nreason to deviate from them.\n8. Therefore, the tribunal accepts the premium payable for the value of\nthe freehold interest in accordance with Schedule 6 of the Leasehold\nReform, Housing & Urban Development Act 1993 is £94,310 plus\n£100 for appurtenant land.\n9.

The original tenancy\nhad been for a term of twelve months from 19 August 2017 at £525.00 per calendar month.\n3 On 18 August 2018 the landlord served notice of increase under section 13(2) of The\nHousing Act 1988 proposing a rent of £600.00 per calendar month to take effect on 19\nSeptember 2018. Neither the previous nor proposed rents included any amounts for\nCouncil Tax, water rates or fixed service charges.\n4 On 6 September 2018 the tenant applied for the rent to be determined by the First-tier\nTribunal Property Chamber.\n5 On 29 October 2018 the Tribunal inspected the property and determined the rent at\n£575.00 p.c.m. with effect from 19 September 2018.\n6 On 5 November 2018 the Tribunal received a request for Reasons from the tenants.\nThe Law\n7 Section 14 of The Housing Act 1988 states:\n'(1) Where, under subsection (4)(a) of section 13 above, a tenant refers to a rent\nassessment committee a notice under subsection (2) of that section, the committee shall\ndetermine the rent at which, subject to subsections (2) and (4) below, the committee\nconsider that the dwelling-house concerned might reasonably be expected to be let in the\nopen market by a willing landlord under an assured tenancy -\n(a) which is a periodic tenancy having the same periods as those of the tenancy to\nwhich the notice relates;\n(b) which begins at the beginning of the new period specified in the notice;\n(c) the terms of which (other than relating to the amount of the rent) are the same as\nthose of the tenancy to which the notice relates;...'\n'(2) In making a determination under this section, there shall be disregarded -\n(a) any effect on the rent attributable to the granting of a tenancy to a sitting tenant;\n(b) any increase in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a relevant\nimprovement carried out by a person who at the time it was carried out was the\ntenant, if the improvement-\n(i) was carried out otherwise than in pursuance of an obligation to the\nimmediate landlord ...\n8 The jurisdiction of the Rent Assessment Committee was transferred to the First-tier\nTribunal (Property Chamber) from 1st July 2013.\n2\n\nFacts Found\n9 The Tribunal inspected the property on 29 October 2018 with the tenants. The landlord\nwas not present or represented.\n10 The property comprised a traditional 1960s two storey semi-detached house in a well\nestablished residential area. The accommodation comprised an enclosed porch, hall,\nthrough lounge / dining room and kitchen on the ground floor with a landing, three\nbedrooms and bathroom on the first floor. Outside, there was a front garden with room to\npark two cars, a back garden with lawn and dilapidated brick garage.\n11 The house was of brick and tile construction with decorative cedar board cladding and\nrendering to the rear elevation.\n12 It was in fair internal condition with double glazing and central heating. However, a gas\nfire in the living room had been condemned by a Gas Safe Engineer and the tenants\nadvised that there were draughts around the double glazed windows as they had been\ninadequately fitted. The rear bedroom was particularly affected.\nSubmissions\n13 Neither of the parties requested a Hearing. They sent written submissions and the case\nwas determined on paper.\n14 The Applicants' Case\nIn summary, the Applicants made eight points:\n1 there were draughts around the double glazing;\n2 the central heating boiler was inefficient;\n3 the gas fire in the living room had been condemned;\n4 there was insufficient heating in the Kitchen for a room of its size;\n5 one of the light switches was only working intermittently;\n6 there was inadequate heating in the bathroom;\n7 the landlord's managing agent had sent an email to the effect that he considered\nthe proposed increase to be unreasonable which was included in the submitted\npapers;\n8 the Applicants referred to three properties advertised to let on the open market\nfor rental comparison:\ni) Vaughan Road, Willenhall\nA similar three bedroom house next door to the subject property advertised at an\nasking rent of £600 per calendar month. It had a fitted kitchen, through lounge,\ncentral heating and double glazing. The tenants considered the house was better\nthan theirs as it had more modern double glazing, kitchen and bathroom suites.\nii) Harrowby Place, Willenhall\nA 1930s three bedroom semi-detached house with very little other information\nprovided which was advertised at £675 per calendar month.\niii) Haley Street, Willenhall\nA modern, possibly 1980s, three bedroom semi-detached house with garage\nadvertised at £550 per month.\n3\n\n15 The Respondent's Case\nThe Respondent Landlord submitted that:\n1 a three bedroom semi-detached house with drive of this quality in the area should\nhave let for £625.00 per month and\n2 the landlord had a mortgage and tax to pay.\nDecision\n16 The Tribunal considered the property and its accommodation and found it to be the sort of\nproperty that would be in demand if advertised vacant and to let in the open market. It\noffered modern three bedroom accommodation with central heating and double glazing,\nalbeit not to the highest specification and the Tribunal accepted the points made by the\ntenants regarding the standard of window fitting, but overall the house was in fair order.\nThe garage was dilapidated but there was ample street parking available when the Tribunal\ninspected and off-road parking to the front of the house.\n17 The rent achieved a year ago was £525.00 per calendar month but rents in the market had\nrisen since then. The Tribunal considered the Landlord's asking rent of £625.00 pcm to be\noptimistic bearing in mind that the neighbouring house, a better specification according to\nthe tenants, was openly advertised at £600.00 pcm and set the ceiling. Accordingly, taking\nthe parties' points into consideration and applying its own general knowledge of the\nmarket, the Tribunal determined the rent at £575.00 pcm for the purposes of section 14 of\nThe Housing Act 1988.\nI.D. Humphries B.Sc.(Est.Man.) FRICS\nChairman\nAppeal\nIf either party is dissatisfied with this decision an application may be made to this\nTribunal for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, Property Chamber (Residential\nProperty) on a point of law only. Any such application must be received within 28 days\nafter the decision and accompanying reasons have been sent to the parties (Rule 52 of the\nTribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013).\n4"

This is an application made by the applicant leaseholder pursuant to\nsection 48 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development\nAct 1993 (“the Act”) for a determination of the premium to be paid for\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nthe grant of a new lease of Flat 53 Romney Court, 139 Haverstock Hill,\nLondon NW3 4RX (the “property”).\n2. By a notice of a claim dated 17 November 2021, served pursuant to\nsection 42 of the Act, the applicant exercised the right for the grant of a\nnew lease in respect of the subject property. At the time, the applicant\nheld the existing lease granted on 18 August 1964 for a term of 100 years\nless ten days from 23 November 1962 at an annual ground rent of\n£30.00. The applicant proposed to pay a premium of £69,700 for the\nnew lease.\n3. On 25 January 2022 the respondent freeholder served a counter-notice\nadmitting the validity of the claim and counter-proposed a premium of\n£97,000 for the grant of a new lease.\n4. On 22 June 2022, the applicant applied to the tribunal for a\ndetermination of the premium.\nThe issues\nMatters agreed\n5. The following matters were agreed:\n(a) The subject property is a self-contained flat on the 5th floor within\na six-storey block of flats constructed in about 1963 and\ncontaining 43 flats of similar kinds;\n(b) The gross internal floor area is 32.52 square metres, which\nequates to 350 square feet;\n(c) The valuation date: 18 November 2021;\n(d) Unexpired term: 41.01 years;\n(e) Ground rent: £30 throughout the term;\n(f) Long leasehold (unimproved) value: 99% of the freehold\n(unimproved) value;\n(g) Capitalisation of ground rent: 1.21% per annum;\n(h) Deferment rate: 5%.\n(i) The lease terms of the new lease were agreed; and\n(j) The second respondent, the intermediate head leaseholder did\nnot want to play any active role in this application.\nMatters not agreed\n6. The following matters were not agreed:\n2\n\n(a) The “no-Act world” short leasehold (unimproved) value: the\napplicant contending in his report for £214,556 and the\nrespondent contending for £229,987.\n(b) The freehold (unimproved) value: the applicant contending for\n£336,770 and the respondent contending for £365.000 .\n(c) The premium payable: £82,347 (Applicant) v £90,712 (First\nRespondent) as per their respective reports.\nThe hearing\n7. The hearing in this matter took place on 24 January 2023 by VIDEO\nREMOTE. The applicant was represented by Mr A Lester MRICS and\nthe respondent by Mr A Cohen.\n8. Neither party asked the tribunal to inspect the property and the tribunal\ndid not consider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection to make\nits determination.\n9. The applicant relied upon the expert report and valuation of Mr Lester\ndated 18 January 2023 and the respondent relied upon the expert report\nand valuation of Mr Cohen dated 13 January 2023.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n10. The tribunal determines that:\nThe Freehold Vacant Possession Value is: £353,088\nRelativity is: 63.01%\nThe premium payable is: £87,594\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\nFreehold Vacant Possession Value\n11. Although both valuers relied upon the sales of comparable properties,\nthe tribunal preferred the narrower but more relevant approach adopted\nby Mr Cohen, who relied on the sales of Flats 45 and 11 Romney Court\nwhich took place 6 months before and 7 months after the relevant\nvaluation date, as it found these sales provided the best comparable\nevidence. This contrasted with Mr Lester’s reliance on 5 comparable\nsales within the subject block which took place over a two-year span of\n3\n\nthe valuation date and made reference to three other sales of properties\nin two different, although similar blocks.\n12.` Mr Lester adjusted his position to agree with Mr Cohen there should be\na 1% adjustment to reflect the differing floor levels of the comparable\nsales and the subject property, instead of the 2% he had originally\ncontended for and the tribunal agreed with this concession.\n13. However, the tribunal did not accept Mr Cohen’s contention that there\nshould be no adjustment made to reflect the fact the lift in the building\nwent only to the 4th floor, thereby requiring the tenant and visitors to\nutilise a flight of stairs to access the property. The tribunal found that an\nadjustment of 2% was appropriate to reflect this disadvantage in\ncomparison to the other flats in the building served by the lift.\n14. The tribunal was a little surprised to learn Mr Lester had not reinspected\nthe property since he had carried out an initial inspection in 2019.\nHowever, it accepted the property was significantly as at the valuation\ndate as no material changes to the property were reflected in Mr Cohen’s\nreport who had inspected in December 2021.\n15. The tribunal did not accept Mr Cohen’s contention there should be no\nadjustments made to reflect a difference in the condition of the improved\nand modernised comparable properties he relied upon and the\nunimproved condition of the subject property. However, the tribunal\nconsidered the adjustment of £17,000 contended for by Mr Lester was\nunrealistic and therefore, relying on its own knowledge and expertise\nconsidered an adjustment of £10,000 was appropriate to reflect the\nunmodernised condition of the subject property.\n16. The tribunal therefore concluded the Freehold Vacant Possession Value\nof the property is £353,088.\nRelativity – The tribunal’s determination\n17. The tribunal determines the appropriate relativity is 63.01%.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n18. Mr Lester contended the appropriate approach to determining relativity\nwas to disregard the use of the Savills Unenfranchiseable Graphs due to\ntheir inherent unreliability and suggested the tribunal should carry out\nan examination of the relevant relativity graphs. Having dismissed any\nreliance on the Unenfranchiseable Graphs, Mr Lester preferred to a\nadopt a deduction of 10% in reliance on The Trustees of the Sloane\nStanley Estate v Munday to a relativity figure of 71.69%, the latter\nfigure produced from a reliance upon Savills Enfranchiseable Graph.\n4\n\n19. Mr Cohen adopted a more traditional approach to the issue of relativity\nand relied upon Gerald Eve (2016) Graph providing a relativity of\n62.92% and Savills Unenfranchiseable Graph which provided a relativity\nof 63.11% providing an average of 63.01%.\n20. In conclusion and applying its determinations as set out above the\ntribunal calculated the Freehold Vacant Value of the property to be\n£353,088 by adopting the sales figures for Flats 11 and 45 Romney Court\nand by making the following adjustments:\n+1% Freehold\n` +1% per floor\n-2% for no lift to 5th floor\n-£10,000 improved specification of the 2 comparable flats of 11\nand 45.\nThe premium\n21. The tribunal determines the appropriate premium to be £87,594.

The applicant, Wellcome Trust Ltd, is the freeholder of the property. The\nproperty is a purpose-built block of 7 flats located on Pont Street in\nKnightsbridge.\n2. The application, dated 29 July 2024, seeks a determination pursuant to\nsection 20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“The Act”)\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\ndispensing with statutory consultation in respect of qualifying works. At\nthe time of that application, those works had already been carried out.\n3. Directions were issued by the Tribunal on 7 August 2024. Amongst other\nthings, those directions provided that the applicant was to serve copies\nof the application form and the Tribunal’s directions upon the\nrespondents, to display a copy of the Tribunal’s directions in the common\nparts of the property and to provide any replies to the Tribunal’s\ndirections received by them from the respondents (or confirm that there\nwas none).\n4. The applicant confirmed, in an email dated 16 August 2024 from\nAnastacia Theophanous, an employee of the applicant’s representative,\nthat the documents referred to in the Tribunal’s directions had been\nserved upon the respondents and displayed at the property (as\nappropriate) on 14 August and 15 August 2024 respectively. In their\nbundle, as directed, the applicant also provided confirmation - by way of\na witness statement dated 11 September 2024 of Anastacia Theophanous\n– that the applicant had not received any responses to the application\nfrom the respondents. Similarly, the Tribunal has not received any reply\nforms (which were provided for in the directions in this matter) nor any\nother submissions from any objecting party.\n5. The Tribunal considered that a paper determination of the application\nwas appropriate, the applicant indicated that they were content for this\nto happen in their application and no objections were received from any\nrespondents. I agree, and I have therefore determined this matter on the\nbasis of the papers provided to me without a hearing.\n6. I did not inspect the subject property as it was not necessary to do so to\ndetermine the present application.\nThe Qualifying Works\n7. The works carried out, and some of the background to the current\napplication, are set out clearly and succinctly in a witness statement\ndated 14 August 2024 provided by Darren Okosi of Ringley Chartered\nSurveyors (the managing agents of the property):\n…\n5. The works that were carried out are lead roof repairs and liquid\nwaterproofing removal\n2\n\n6. The works were of an urgent nature. There was water ingress\ngoing throughout the roof structure causing damage to the flat 5\n(a top floor flat). When rainfall occurred the damage would\nworsen and the need for dispensation was apparent to protect\nthe fabric of the building.\n7. There was no consultation due to the urgency of the works.\n8. The works were completed in mid-July 2024 and were\ncompleted by Rosco and Perlini. They cost £6,912.00 inculding\nVAT plus the 10% contingency fee of £691.20 which is a total of\n£7,603.20.\n…\n8. The applicant also provided a report from Rosco & Perlini in their bundle\nin relation to the need for the works, which was in part difficult to read.\nI am unsure whether that is because of a formatting error in the\npreparation of the bundle or a stylistic choice in the report’s design – but\nthis is of no import as Mr Okosi has provided cogent and unchallenged\nevidence regarding the works, and what is clear from Rosco & Perlini’s\nreport is that at the time of their inspection there were “numerous holes\nand splits in the lead waterproofing”, and that “poor waterproofing\nrepairs have been carried out using liquid waterproofing”, both of which\nare supported by photos in that report.\n9. The report goes on to say that “We recommend it [the liquid\nwaterproofing] is removed and once the lead repairs have been\ncompleted, all lead work should be coated with Pantination oil to prolong\nthe life of the roof.”\nDecision and Reasons\n10. Section 20ZA(1) of the Act provides:\nWhere an application is made to the appropriate tribunal for a\ndetermination to dispense with all or any of the consultation\nrequirements in relation to any qualifying works or qualifying long\nterm agreement, the tribunal may make the determination if satisfied\nthat it is reasonable to dispense with the requirements.\n11. The applicant’s case is that the works were required urgently to remedy\nwater ingress caused by a damaged lead roof. No representations have\nbeen received that dispute this, and the applicant has provided a witness\n3\n\nstatement from a member of the managing agent’s staff and a report\nfrom their contractor regarding it.\n12. No leaseholder or other interested party has indicated their objection to\nthe application at all. It is therefore trite to note that no leaseholder or\nother interested party has identified any prejudice that might be, or has\nbeen, suffered by them as a result of the failure to consult. Similarly, I\nhave not identified any clear prejudice that the leaseholders or any other\ninterested parties have suffered, or might suffer, in the absence of any\nsuch representations from them.\n13. In light of the above, I consider it reasonable to grant the application for\ndispensation from statutory consultation. No conditions on the grant of\ndispensation are appropriate and I therefore make none.\n14. This decision does not affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction upon an\napplication to make a determination under section 27A of the Act in\nrespect of the reasonable and payable costs of the works, should this be\ndisputed by any leaseholder.\nName: Mr O Dowty MRICS Date: 23 September 2024\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\n4\n\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n5"

Unless stated otherwise, the page references in square brackets in this\ndecision are to the pages in the hearing bundle consisting of 262 pages.\n2. The Applicant seeks an order pursuant to s.20ZA of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985 (“the Act”) for retrospective dispensation with the\nconsultation requirements in respect of the supply and installation of a new\ninsulated built up felt roofing system and remove the existing lead lined\nvalley coverings, repair decking and coat with a garland dura-coat at the\nCrown and Groves Mill, 474-479 London Road, CR4 4FY (“the property”).\n2. The property is described as being a purpose built block consisting of 30\nflats.\n3. The Applicant is the management company and a party to the residential\nleases. As the Tribunal understands it, the Applicant is obliged to carry out\nthe repairing and maintaining obligations under the leases on behalf of the\nfreeholder, Wallace Estates Limited. The Respondents are the long\nleaseholders of the residential flats in the building. It appears that the\nApplicant is a “tenant owned” company in so far as each of the leaseholders\nowns a share in it.\n4. The leaseholders were served with a Notice of Intention dated 30 July 2021\nby the current managing agent, HML PM Limited (“HML”), to commence\nthe statutory consultation process under section 20 of the Act in relation to\nthe major works that are the subject matter of this application.\n5. For reasons unknown, the consultation process was not completed by HML.\nWhat then happened thereafter is set out variously in the witness\nstatements of Selena Msnikosa and Kevin Jones, who are directors of the\nApplicant and David Flack who is a director of HML [216-225]. It is not\nintended to repeat the evidence in detail set out in the witness statements\nas this is self-evident.\n6. However, in short, in or around April 2023, the directors of the Applicant,\nthrough HML undertook a tendering process and received quotations from\nthree different contractors in order to undertake a cost comparison. Having\ndone so, it was decided to proceed with the tenders from two contractors, G\nBaker Roofing Limited and Opus Waterproofing Solutions Limited.\n7. The remaining two tenders were issued to the leaseholders. This was done\nthrough a leaseholders’ meeting and followed up by email correspondence\nbetween the attendees at the meeting to assess whether the leaseholders\nhad any view on the final decision.\n8. This involved extensive email communication between the Applicant’s\ndirectors and leaseholders to address a number of questions regarding the\nspecifications and pricing of the individual blocks.\n2\n\n9. It was finally decided by the directors that the contractor, G Baker, would\nbe instructed and begin as soon as possible in 2023 and subsequently the\nworks were completed in June 2023. The costs of the works would be\ndeducted from the reserve fund because any delay to collect funds from the\nleaseholders would invariably mean the global costs of the works would\nincrease and thereby the financial burden on the leaseholders.\n10. In addition, the Applicant relied on the witness statement of Terrent Beggs\nwho is a Chartered Construction Manager from the firm of SRVO Property\nLimited, who inspected the roofs in February 2022 and confirmed its\ndeteriorating condition [226-228]. Mr Beggs was responsible for\ninspecting and confirming the condition of the existing roofs, coordinating\nthird-party technical specialists, drafting the Specification and Schedule of\nWorks, managing the competitive tender process and monitoring site\nprogress and liaising with the appointed contractor and Langley\nWaterproofing Systems Ltd to achieve certified completion and issue of\nwarranty documentation.\n11. By an application dated 15 January 2025, the Applicant applied seeking\nretrospective dispensation for the roof works carried out. On 28 March\n2025, the Tribunal issued amended Directions requiring the Applicant to\nserve the Respondents with a copy of the application, which apparently was\ndone. The Respondents were directed to respond to the application stating\nwhether they objected to it in any way.\n12. Although the application initially named Faizah Qudsia Khan and Nasir\nMahmood (Flat 18) as the Respondents to the application, they have not\nraised any objection. The leaseholders who variously did object are:\nSimone Cotterell (Flat 16)\nSajith Bakeerathan (Flat 9)\nMarcello Tremonte and Ewelina Jarmoszuk (Flat 21)\nJo Koerner (Flat 5)\nGiancarlo Lamari and Saoriko Matsumoto\nPaula Cox (Flat 3)\nOliver Smart (Flat 26)\nMarek Florczak\n13. It should be noted is that all of the objections by the leaseholders above is\nin exactly the same terms verbatim. The inference to be drawn is that it was\nprepared by the same person or persons and endorsed by the other\nleaseholders who objected. The objections are dealt with in turn below.\nRelevant Law\n14. This is set out in the Appendix annexed hereto.\nHearing\n15. The hearing took place on 6 October 2025. The Applicant was\nrepresented by Mr Irvine of Counsel. None of the Respondents or the\n3\n\nleaseholders who objected to the application attended or were\nrepresented. The Tribunal proceeded with the hearing in their absence\nbecause it was satisfied they had been served with a notice of the hearing\nby email on 31 Jul 2025.\n16. It should also be noted that, save for the objections made, none of the\nleaseholders had filed or served any evidence as directed. Therefore, the\nhearing proceeded with only the evidence of the Applicant before it.\nDecision\nThe Objections\n17. The general basis of the objections made is:\n(a) the alleged complete lack of statutory consultation under section\n20 of the Act prior to the works.\n(b) Unreasonable delay in seeking dispensation, being over a year\nafter the works were completed in 2023.\n(c) Lack of transparency in both the scope of works and financial\nbreakdown.\n(d) Serious and lasting financial prejudice caused to leaseholders.\nThe Amount in Question\n18. As the Tribunal’s directions make clear, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction\nto consider the quantum of the roof works in this application. If the lease\nholders wish to challenge this, they will have to make a separate\napplication under section 27A of the Act.\nComplete Lack of Consultation or Notice\n19. This is a factually incorrect assertion. For the avoidance of doubt, the\nTribunal finds that the Applicant did serve a Notice of Intention on or\nabout 30 July 2021 and, to that extent, partial statutory consultation did\ntake place. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal also found that\ninformal consultation had been carried out by the Applicant with the\nleaseholders by the publication regarding the specification and pricing\nfor the roof works prior to the works commencing and the extensive\ndiscussion that followed by email to answer and questions raised by\nleaseholders.\nComplete Lack of Trust in HML\n20. This is not a relevant consideration in the exercise of the Tribunal’s\ndiscretion in this application. It is a management complaint.\n4\n\nImpact on Reserve Funds and Long Term Cost Concerns\n21. The objecting leaseholders assert that, by utilising the reserve fund to\npay for the roof works, the reserve fund has been reduced to almost zero.\nThis has resulted in the reserve fund contribution demanded by the\nApplicant doubling, which has resulted in an increased financial burden\non leaseholders.\n22. The Tribunal was satisfied that using the reserve fund to pay for the roof\nworks has not caused the leaseholders financial prejudice. It is not\nsuggested by any of them that the roof works or the scope of the works\nundertaken was unnecessary. The works had to be funded in one of two\nways. It could be done by using the reserve fund, as was the case, or\nservice charge demands to meet the cost could have been issued. Either\nway, the cost had to be met by the leaseholders. The Tribunal accepted\nthe Applicant’s submission that any delay to collect funds from the\nleaseholders would invariably mean the global costs of the works would\nincrease and thereby the financial burden on the leaseholders. It follows,\nthat the Tribunal was satisfied the objecting leaseholders could not\nestablish as a fact any financial prejudice.\nExpired Section 20 Notices and Prejudice to New Leaseholders\n23. As a matter of law, there is no time limit to the validity of the Notice of\nIntention dated 30 July 2021 and the submission in those terms is\nincorrect.\n24. As to the assertion that leaseholders who purchased after July 2021, no\ninformation was provided about who those leaseholders are, when they\npurchased their flats and to what extent it is said that they were denied\nthe opportunity to be consulted thereby resulting in financial prejudice.\n25. Even if that assertion is correct, the Tribunal was satisfied that the\nalleged failure to consult did not result in financial prejudice because the\nleaseholders separately have the statutory protection afforded by section\n19 of the Act to challenge the need, scope and cost of the roof works.\nThe Relevant Legal Test: Daejan v Benson\n26. The arguments and or submissions set out here are simply a repeat of\nthose already set out above and dealt with.\nAlleged Management Failures of HML\n27. This is not a relevant consideration in the exercise of the Tribunal’s\ndiscretion in this application. These are management complaints.\nDamage to Estate Grounds\n28. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to make any determination about this\nissue in this application.\n5\n\n29. The relevant test to the applied in an application such as this has been\nset out in the Supreme Court decision in Daejan Investments Ltd v\nBenson & Ors [2013] UKSC 14 where it was held that the purpose of\nthe consultation requirements imposed by section 20 of the Act was to\nensure that tenants were protected from paying for inappropriate works\nor paying more than was appropriate. In other words, a tenant should\nsuffer no prejudice in this way.\n30. The issue before the Tribunal was whether dispensation should be\ngranted in relation to the requirement to carry out statutory consultation\nwith the leaseholders regarding the overall remedial fire detection\nworks. The Tribunal is not concerned about the actual cost that has been\nincurred.\n31. The Tribunal granted the application for the following main reasons:\n(a) The Tribunal was satisfied that the Respondents could not\nestablish as a fact at this time that they had suffered any financial\nprejudice about the necessity and scope of the roof works or\nutilising the reserve fund to pay for the works. They had not filed\nany evidence to this effect or at all.\n(b) Whilst, on the Applicant’s own case, there had been delay in\ndealing with the roof repairs since the Notice of Intention was\nserved, the Tribunal was unable to find that any such delay had\nresulted in financial prejudice to the leaseholders. On the\ncontrary, the Tribunal was satisfied that on balance any further\ndelay by the Applicant having to carry out statutory consultation\nwould have resulted in the cost of the work increasing, which\nwould cause the leaseholders financial prejudice.\n(c) Importantly, the real prejudice to the Respondents would be in\nthe cost of the work and they have the statutory protection of\nsection 19 of the Act, which preserves their right to challenge the\nactual costs incurred by making a separate service charge\napplication under section 27A of the Act.\n32. The Tribunal, therefore, concluded that the Respondents were not being\nprejudiced by the Applicant’s failure to consult, and the application was\ngranted as sought.\n33. It should be noted that in granting this part of the application, the\nTribunal makes no finding that the scope and cost of the repairs are\nreasonable.\nName: Tribunal Judge Mohabir Date: 21 October 2025\n6\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n7\n\nAppendix of relevant legislation\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 (as amended)\nSection 20\n(1) Where this section applies to any qualifying works or qualifying\nlong term agreement, the relevant contributions of tenants are\nlimited in accordance with subsection (6) or (7) (or both) unless the\nconsultation requirements have been either—\n(a) complied with in relation to the works or agreement, or\n(b) dispensed with in relation to the works or agreement by (or\non appeal from) the appropriate tribunal .\n(2) In this section “relevant contribution”, in relation to a tenant and\nany works or agreement, is the amount, which he may be required\nunder the terms of his lease to contribute (by the payment of\nservice charges) to relevant costs incurred on carrying out the\nworks or under the agreement.\n(3) This section applies to qualifying works if relevant costs incurred\non carrying out the works exceed an appropriate amount.\n(4) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that this section\napplies to a qualifying long term agreement—\n(a) if relevant costs incurred under the agreement exceed an\nappropriate amount, or\n(b) if relevant costs incurred under the agreement during a\nperiod prescribed by the regulations exceed an appropriate\namount.\n(5) An appropriate amount is an amount set by regulations made by\nthe Secretary of State; and the regulations may make provision for\neither or both of the following to be an appropriate amount—\n(a) an amount prescribed by, or determined in accordance with,\nthe regulations, and\n(b) an amount which results in the relevant contribution of any\none or more tenants being an amount prescribed by, or\ndetermined in accordance with, the regulations.\n(6) Where an appropriate amount is set by virtue of paragraph (a) of\nsubsection (5), the amount of the relevant costs incurred on\ncarrying out the works or under the agreement which may be taken\ninto account in determining the relevant contributions of tenants is\nlimited to the appropriate amount.\n(7) Where an appropriate amount is set by virtue of paragraph (b) of\nthat subsection, the amount of the relevant contribution of the\ntenant, or each of the tenants, whose relevant contribution would\notherwise exceed the amount prescribed by, or determined in\n8\n\naccordance with, the regulations is limited to the amount so\nprescribed or determined.\nSection 20ZA\n(1) Where an application is made to a leasehold valuation tribunal for a\ndetermination to dispense with all or any of the consultation\nrequirements in relation to any qualifying works or qualifying long-\nterm agreement, the tribunal may make the determination if\nsatisfied that it is reasonable to dispense with the requirements.\n9"

      "text": "FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL\nPROPERTY CHAMBER\n(RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY)\nCase reference : LON/00AZ/LSC/2025/0633\nFirst Floor Flat 9, Honor Oak Park,\nProperty :\nLondon, SE23 1DX\nApplicant : Marcus Holland\nRepresentative : In person\nRespondent : Assethold\nRepresentative : Mr Decker of Counsel\nAn application under section 27A\nType of application :\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985\nJudge Shepherd\nTribunal :\nStephen Mason FRICS\nDate of Decision : 4th September 2025\n© Crown Copyright 2025\nDETERMINATION\n1. In this case there was a challenge to the reasonableness and payability of service\ncharges. The challenge was brought pursuant to Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985,s.27A. The Applicant was Mr Holland who appeared in person. He is a\nleaseholder of the First Floor Flat, 9 Honor Oak Park, London, SE23 1DX (“The\npremises”). The freeholder is Assethold who were represented by Mr Decker of\nCounsel. The premises is a flat in a building with one other flat.\n2. The service charges are challenged for the years 2024 and 2025. A Tribunal\nmade a determination previously. This was the decision in\nLON/00AZ/LSC/2024/0061. We were disappointed to be informed that the\nRespondent has failed to adhere to that determination and the Applicant has\nhad to proceed against the Respondent in the County Court. Unfortunately, this\nTribunal has no enforcement powers so we were unable to take any action\nourselves such as barring the Respondents from taking any part in the\nproceedings until the previous determination had been acted upon. Suffice to\nsay that we expect this determination to be adhered to.\n1\n\nThe lease terms\n3. The terms were uncontentious and nothing turned on them so they are not\nrecited.\nThe law\n4. The law applicable in the present case was limited. It was an assessment of the\nreasonableness and payability of the costs.\n5. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985,s.19 states the following:\n19.— Limitation of service charges: reasonableness.\n(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the amount\nof a service charge payable for a period—\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the carrying\nout of works, only if the services or works are of a reasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.\n(2) Where a service charge is payable before the relevant costs are\nincurred, no greater amount than is reasonable is so payable, and after the\nrelevant costs have been incurred any necessary adjustment shall be made\nby repayment, reduction or subsequent charges or otherwise.\n6. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction to address the issues in s.19 is contained in s.27A\nLandlord and Tenant 1985 which states the following:\n27A Liability to pay service charges: jurisdiction\n1. An application may be made to [the appropriate tribunal]2 for a\ndetermination whether a service charge is payable and, if it is, as to—\na. the person by whom it is payable,\nb. the person to whom it is payable,\nc. the amount which is payable,\nd. the date at or by which it is payable, and\ne. the manner in which it is payable.\n2\n\n2. Subsection (1) applies whether or not any payment has been made.\n3. An application may also be made to [the appropriate tribunal]2 for a\ndetermination whether, if costs were incurred for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements, insurance or management of any\nspecified description, a service charge would be payable for the costs\nand, if it would, as to—\na. the person by whom it would be payable,\nb. the person to whom it would be payable,\nc. the amount which would be payable,\nd. the date at or by which it would be payable, and\ne. the manner in which it would be payable.\n4. No application under subsection (1) or (3) may be made in respect of a\nmatter which—\na. has been agreed or admitted by the tenant,\nb. has been, or is to be, referred to arbitration pursuant to a post-dispute\narbitration agreement to which the tenant is a party,\nc. has been the subject of determination by a court, or\nd. has been the subject of determination by an arbitral tribunal pursuant\nto a post-dispute arbitration agreement.\n5. But the tenant is not to be taken to have agreed or admitted any matter\nby reason only of having made any payment.\n7. In Waaler v Hounslow [2017] EWCA Civ 45 the Court of Appeal held the\nfollowing:\nWhether costs were “reasonably incurred” within the meaning of section\n19(1)(a) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 , as inserted, was to be\ndetermined by reference to an objective standard of reasonableness, not by\nthe lower standard of rationality, and the cost of the relevant works to be\nborne by the lessees was part of the context for deciding whether they had been\nso reasonably incurred; that the focus of the inquiry was not simply a question\nof the landlord's decision-making process but was also one of outcome; that,\nwhere a landlord had chosen a course of action which led to a reasonable\noutcome, the costs of pursuing that course of action would have been\nreasonably incurred even if there were a cheaper outcome which was also\nreasonable; that, further, before carrying out works of any size the landlord\nwas obliged to comply with consultation requirements and, inter alia,\n3\n\nconscientiously to consider the lessees' observations and to give them due\nweight, following which it was for the landlord to make the final decision; that\nthe court, in deciding whether that final decision was reasonable, would\naccord a landlord a margin of appreciation; that, further, while the same legal\ntest applied to all categories of work falling within the scope of the definition\nof “service charge” in section 18 of the 1985 Act, as inserted, there was a real\ndifference between work which the landlord was obliged to carry out and\nwork which was an optional improvement, and different considerations came\ninto the assessment of reasonableness in different factual situations\n8. The Applicant’s challenges are taken in turn\nInsurance costs\n9. The costs sought by the Respondent for the Applicant’s contribution was\n£900.58 for 2024 and £945.61 for 2025. The previous Tribunal had found that\n£575 was a reasonable sum. The Applicant had obtained alternative quotes.\nThese were from AxA insurance (£1016.54 for the whole property). He said the\nRespondent’s insurance policy did not reflect the fact that this was only a small\nbuilding. Mr Decker said the Applicant’s quotes were less reputable and there\nwas not a like for like quote. We reject this criticism. The comparators are\nreasonable. We allow a premium of £575 for 2024 and £600 for the estimated\namount in 2025.\nCommon Parts electricity\n10. The Respondent was seeking to recover from the Applicant £121.97 for 2024\nand £125 for 2025. The common parts electricity charges in a building this\nsmall are likely to be modest. We were told that the account was in credit by\n£600. Mr Decker sought to argue that notwithstanding the credit the\nRespondent could continue to make electricity charges. It’s hard to see how this\ncould be right. The leaseholders should enjoy the benefit of the credit until it\nhas expired. The credit has arisen though their payments. Accordingly, we\ndetermine that no sums are due for communal electricity for either year in\nquestion.\nMonthly testing of emergency lighting and smoke alarm\n4\n\n11. The Respondent was seeking to recover £108.60 for 2024 and £250 for 2025.\nThe Applicant said that nobody was inspecting and if they had been they would\nhave been picked up on his camera. The evidence about this was inconclusive\nbut we consider that monthly tests are excessive and allow 1/3 of the amount\nclaimed to reflect quarterly inspections which should be adequate. We allow\n£36.20 in 2024 and £83 in 2025.\nFire health and safety service\n12. The Respondent was seeking to obtain from the Applicant £174 for 2024 and\n£200 for 2025. We consider that a five yearly inspection of the fire health and\nsafety services is adequate in such a small building. The previous Tribunal\nfound the same and allowed the charge for 2020. Accordingly, we disallow the\nsum for 2024 and allow the £200 charge for 2025.\nFire health and safety risk assessment\n13. The Respondent was seeking to recover from the Applicant £204 for 2024 and\n£212.50 for 2025. The inspection was annual. We consider this is excessive.\nThis was also found to be the case by the previous Tribunal. They said a five\nyearly inspection was enough and allowed the inspection in 2020 therefore we\ndisallow the sum for 2024 and allow £212.50 for 2025.\nFire door inspection access denied - £60\n14. This related to an abortive visit when the person carrying out the inspection\ncould not gain access. It is not excessive as a call out fee and is payable.\nWindow cleaning\n15. There was no provision in the lease allowing window cleaning as the windows\nfall within the demise of individual leaseholders. Mr Decker sought to rely on\nan unusual document in the Respondent’s bundle. The document stated the\nfollowing:\n5\n\nTHIS REGULATION IS MADE ON THE 1 JANUARY 2019\nWe as managing agents of the following property known as:\n9 Honor Oak Park, London, SE23 1DX\nMake the following regulation:\nThe lessor shall have the right (but not the obligation) to arrange for the\nexternal window cleaning of the demised premises at such interval as it shall\nreasonably determine, and the cost of such cleaning shall be included as part\nof the service charge under Clause 5 of the lease. The lessee shall permit access\nto the demised premises as reasonably required to facilitate such cleaning.\nThis regulation has been added due to the request of the current leaseholders\nin order to maintain the property to its best ability.\n16. The document was signed by Eagerstates. We have doubts about this document.\nIt is a unilateral imposition of services without the signed agreement of the\nleaseholders. It was allegedly created just before the Applicant became the\nleaseholder. It was not shown to the previous Tribunal. In any event we do not\nconsider that it is sufficient to vary the lease. We disallow the window cleaning\ncharges for both years.\nGutter cleaning\n17. The Respondent was seeking to recover from the Applicant gutter cleaning costs\nof £159 for 2024 and £175 for 2025. The gutters are cleaned twice a year. We\nconsider this is excessive and allow £80 for 2024 and £88 for 2025.\nEmergency light replacement - £211.20\n18. We were shown an invoice for this work and we allow the cost as it is reasonable.\n6\n\nNIEC Inspection and BNO Inspection\n19. The Respondent was seeking to recover from the Applicant £149.40 for a NIEC\ninspection in 2024 and £99 for a BNO inspection. One inspection is sufficient\nand we allow £149.40.\nAccountant\n20. The Respondent was seeking to recover costs of £216 for 2024 and £240 for\n2025. These are recoverable sums under the lease and appear reasonable\ntherefore both sums are allowed.\nManagement fees\n21. The Respondent was seeking to recover costs of £303.60 for 2024 and £312 for\n2025.The Applicant was very dissatisfied with the service he was receiving. The\nprevious Tribunal found that the service was poor. It hasn’t improved.\nSignificantly the previous determination by the Tribunal has not been\naccommodated and has effectively been ignored. We consider that a substantial\ndeduction is necessary and allow £100 for each year.\nGrit spreading - £51\n22. We consider this sum is reasonable and allow it.\nGardening - £204\n23. This sum was being charged for 2024. The communal garden is tiny and we\nconsider the charge is excessive for the work required. We allow £102.\nKey cutting - £8.28\n24. This is allowed\n7\n\nDrain service - £125 ( 2025 only)\n25. It is not necessary to carry out pre-emptive drain inspections. This is\ndisallowed.\nBin cleaning - £100 ( 2025 only)\n26. The local authority supplies the bins. There is no need for a cleaning service.\nThis is disallowed\nCarpet cleaning - £150 ( 2025 only)\n27. This is a recoverable cost under the lease. The area to be cleaned is a small area.\nWe allow £100.\nRepair Fund £1250 (2025 only)\n28. It is a prudent measure to maintain a repair fund but £1250 per leaseholder is\nexcessive. We consider £500 is sufficient.\nSection 20C Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and fees\n29. The Applicant was overwhelmingly successful in this case and we allow his\napplication under s.20C of the 1985 Act. In addition, we order the Respondent\nto repay his hearing and application fees – a total of £310.\nJudge Shepherd\n4th September 2025\n8\n\nANNEX - RIGHTS OF APPEAL Appealing against the tribunal’s decisions\n1. A written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at\nthe Regional tribunal office which has been dealing with the case.\n2. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the Regional tribunal\noffice within 28 days after the date this decision is sent to the parties.\n3. If the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with\nthe 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide\nwhether to allow the application for permission to appeal to proceed despite not\nbeing within the time limit.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must state the grounds of appeal,\nand state the result the party making the application is seeking. All applications for\npermission to appeal will be considered on the papers\n5. Any application to stay the effect of the decision must be made at the same time\nas the application for permission to appeal.\n9"

There is no need for any party to attend at the\ntribunal offices on that day. Rights of Appeal are set out in the Appendix.\nSummary of the decisions made by the First-tier Tribunal\n(i) The claim for service charges and administration charges is\ndismissed.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\n(ii) An order is made under Section 20C of the Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985 so that the landlord may not pass any of its costs incurred in\nconnection with the proceedings before the tribunal through the service\ncharge.\n(iii) An order is made under Paragraph 5A of Schedule 11 of the\nCommonhold and leasehold Reform Act 2002 so that the landlord may\nnot pass on any of its costs incurred in connection with the proceedings\nbefore the tribunal through an administration charge.\nSummary of the decisions made by the County Court\n(iv) There be no order for costs under either the lease or the Civil\nProcedure Rules.\nThe Application\n1. On 23 October 2018, the Applicant issued proceedings in the Money\nClaims Centre claiming the following in respect of Flat B (“the flat”), 24\nBelsize Grove, London, NW3 4TR (“the property”):\n(i) £703.67 in respect of “redecoration charge”. The pleading referred to\nClause 2(2) of the lease whereby the landlord was entitled to recover\nthe cost of decorating the property.\n(ii) £250 in respect of administration fees charged in respect of the\nfailure to pay the “redecoration charge”;\n(iii) £840 in respect of contractual cost, namely the legal costs of\nrecovering the said charges up to the date of issue of proceedings;\n(iv) contractual costs in respect of the costs incurred after the issue of\nproceedings.\n2. On 15 November 2018, the Respondents filed a Defence which stated:\n“we dispute all of the items listed as all service charges are paid to date\nand no information or proof of the decoration charges have been\nprovided nor any agreement or administration fee nor claimant costs\nincluded”. Ms Lipman sent an e-mail with the Defence which stated:\n“we have no information on how £703.67 for December charges has\nbeen calculated, please provide a complete breakdown because we are\ndisputing it and have never been advised of the charge before”.\n3. On 5 February 2019, the case was transferred to the Barnet County\nCourt. On 11 February 2019, the case was transferred on to the\n2\n\nClerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court. On 1 March 2019, District\nJudge Bull transferred the case to this Tribunal.\n4. As the Court transferred the whole case to the Tribunal, under the\nDeployment of Judges Pilot, the judge who eventually heard the case\nwould deal with all the issues listed above, including contractual costs,\nat the same time as deciding the payability of the service and\nadministration charges. The judge is empowered to do so as a result of\namendments made to the County Courts Act 1984, by which judges of\nthe First-tier Tribunal are now also judges of the county court. This\nmeans that the judge sits as a judge of the county court and can decide\nissues that would otherwise have to be separately decided in the county\ncourt. The Pilot is intended to lead to savings in time, costs and\nresources.\n5. On 14 March, the Tribunal gave Directions. The Tribunal had\nconsidered that this modest case could be fairly determined on the\npapers. On 21 March 2019, the Applicant requested an oral hearing.\n6. On 4 April, the Applicant sent its Statement of Case to the\nRespondents. Although not strictly required to do so, it also sent a copy\nto the Tribunal. The Respondent stated how the redecoration charges\nwere payable under the terms of the lease. The Respondent exhibited\n68 pages of documents. The Directions required the Applicant to\nprovide full details of the redecoration works and the reason for them.\nThe Statement of Case stated: “The Applicant’s redecoration charge is\nfor Plumbers invoices (sic) that were carried out to the property”. There\nis a reference to an e-mail dated 13 November 2018 (at p.111). however,\nthis makes no reference to any redecoration works.\n7. By 25 April, the Respondents should have sent their Statement of Case\nto the Respondent. They failed to do so. The case was initially set down\nfor hearing on 5 June. On 9 April, Ms Israel requested an adjournment\nand the case was adjourned to 12 June.\n8. On 14 May, the Applicant filed a Bundle of Documents for the hearing\nwhich extends to 127 pages. The Applicant noted that the Respondents\nhad not provided any bundle with their Statement of Case. On 17 May,\nthe Tribunal reminded the Respondents that they had failed to provide\nany Statement of Case. This was not provided.\nThe Hearing\n9. Mr Jonathan Wragg, Counsel, instructed by PDC Law, appeared on\nbehalf of the Applicant. He was at a distinct disadvantage in that he was\nnot accompanied by anyone from either his instructing solicitor, his\nclient, or Red Rock Property Management (“Red Rock”) who are the\nmanaging agents. He made the surprising submission that the Tribunal\n3\n\nhad no jurisdiction to hear the application as it did not relate to service\ncharges. He invited the Tribunal to refer the matter back to the County\nCourt. He stated that he was unaware that the case had been\ntransferred under the Deployment Scheme and that this had not been\napparent from the Directions.\n10. The Respondents were represented by Ms Claudia Israel. She lives in\nthe flat. She was accompanied by Ms Stephanie Lipman, her mother,\nwho lives at 79 Kingsley Way. They were also accompanied by Mr Amar\nwho is Ms Israel’s fiancé.\n11. The Tribunal asked the Respondents why they had failed to serve any\nStatement of Case. Ms Israel stated that they had e-mailed a number of\ndocuments to the Tribunal on Friday, 7 June. The Tribunal has no\nrecord on receiving such an e-mail. Mr Wragge stated that the\nRespondent had e-mailed a number of documents to the Applicant on 7\nJune. He had no objection to the Tribunal seeing these documents.\nHowever, he stated that he was in no position to deal with any factual\ndispute as he had no witnesses. Indeed, he was not instructed as to the\nApplicant’s response to the factual averments raised in these\ndocuments.\n12. The Tribunal asked the Respondents to explain their failure to comply\nwith the Directions which are made to enable lay parties to prepare and\npresent their cases so that they can be fairly determined in a\nproportionate manner. The Respondents’ initial explanation was that\nthey had not received any of the relevant documents from either the\nTribunal or the Applicant. The Applicant had given their address as 79\nKingsley Way, the address at which Ms Lipman resides. We were told\nthat this was the correspondence address provided by the Respondents.\nThe Applicant had also copied letters to the flat. When confronted with\nthe suggestion that it was most improbable that the Respondents had\nnot received any of the correspondence, the Respondents suggested\nthat they might have received correspondence from the Tribunal, but\nnot from the Applicant. This position became equally untenable when it\nbecame apparent that a copy of the Applicant’s State of Case, receipt of\nwhich they had denied, was in their possession. We are satisfied that\nthe Respondent’s approach to this case has been chaotic to an extreme.\nHad we needed to determine any factual issues, we would not have\nbeen minded to give the Respondents permission to adduce any\nevidence, given the prejudice that this would have caused to the\nApplicant.\nThe Law\n13. Section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, defines a “service\ncharge”:\n4\n\n(1) In the following provisions of this Act \"service charge\" means an\namount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to the\nrent -\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements or insurance or the landlord's costs\nof management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to\nthe relevant costs.\n14. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 11 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform\nAct 2002 defines an “administration charge:\n(1) In this Part of this Schedule “administration charge” means an\namount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to the\nrent which is payable, directly or indirectly—\n(a) for or in connection with the grant of approvals under his\nlease, or applications for such approvals,\n(b) for or in connection with the provision of information or\ndocuments by or on behalf of the landlord or a person who is\nparty to his lease otherwise than as landlord or tenant,\n(c) in respect of a failure by the tenant to make a payment by the\ndue date to the landlord or a person who is party to his lease\notherwise than as landlord or tenant, or\n(d) in connection with a breach (or alleged breach) of a covenant\nor condition in his lease.\n15. As part of the statutory armoury to protect residential tenants from\nbeing required to pay unreasonable service charges and administration\ncharges, any demand must be accompanied by the relevant Summary of\nRights and Obligations.\nThe Background\n16. The Respondents are the lessees of the flat which is at the rear on the\nlower ground floor. Their lease is dated 30 July 1984 (at p.12). The\nRespondents acquired their interest on 6 August 2014, paying a\npremium of £1,595,000. Ms Israel occupies the flat.\n17. On 29 March 2017, Red Rock demanded payment of £892.80 (p.108).\nThe demand was accompanied by the Summary of Rights and\nObligations in respect of a service charge. The invoice referred to two\ninvoices from Plumbers.org, dated 29 March 2017, Invoice No. 150609\nin the sum of £288.00 and 15627 in the sum of £604.80:\n(i) Invoice 15609 (at p.119) refers to an out of hours visit on 22 March\n2017 because there was no heating or hot water for Flats A, G, and H. It\nwas apparent that someone had turned off the boiler. It states that the\nwork was completed on 21 March 2017 (sic).\n5\n\n(ii) Invoice 15627 (at p.116) refers to a suspected gas leak. Another\ncompany had shut the boiler off. It states that the operatives attend on\n24 November 2017 (sic) and that the work was completed on 24 March\n2017.\n18. On 4 April 2018, Property Debt Collection Limited sent a pre-action\nprotocol letter to the Respondents. This was sent both to the flat (at\np.125) and 79 Kingsley Way (p.122). A total of £3,356.70 was claimed\nwhich included: (i) service charges of £2,213.90; (ii) the two items of\n“redecoration charge” in the sums of £288.00 and £604.80, and (iii)\nadministration charges of £250 for late payment of the redecoration\ncharges.\n19. On 23 October 2018, the Applicant issued Particulars of Claim in the\nMoney Claims Centre. A Statement of Account (at p.95) suggests that\n£4,250.87 was owing on this date. However, the claim was restricted to\n(i) £703.67 in respect of “redecoration charge”; (ii) the administration\ncharge of £250; and (iii) costs claimed pursuant to the contract and the\nCPR. The Tribunal was told that the clam for the “redecoration charge”\nhad reduced from £892.80 to £703.67 because the Applicant had\napplied a sum of £189.10 paid in respect of service charges against this\ndebt.\n20. The substance of the dispute between the parties over the two invoices\nis set out in an e-mail dated 13 November 2018 (at p.111):\n(i) Ms Israel had stated: “I am not responsible for these costs. This was\nthe carbon monoxide that was leaking from the communal boiler in the\nbuilding. As confirmed by National Grid. I provided the CORGI\ncertificate from the emergency’s plumber that needed to be called. As\nyou will recall this happened several times that month and the\nauthorities cut off on these occasions the gas supply as it was deemed\nunsafe”.\n(ii) Adrian Calver, on behalf of Red Rock, responded: “AC the\ncontractor you had attend the property to turn off the boiler was not a\ngas engineer, there was no evidence following your contractor turning\noff the gas that there was an issue. You were asked to provide evidence\nthat your contractor was an approved gas safe contractor but the\nevidence you provided did not confirm this. This point was made to you\nat the start of the last meeting. Each time you tamper with the boiler\nthere is a cost to send contractor to the development to check the boiler\nand turn it back on”.\nOur Determination\n21. Under the Deployment Scheme:\n6\n\n(i) The Tribunal administers the whole case on behalf of the County\nCourt, and Judge Latham, sitting as a District Judge of the County\nCourt (“DJ Latham”), is entitled to make directions having regard to\nthe provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (the “CPR”).\n(ii) Judge Latham and Mr Michael Mathews, sitting as a First-tier\nTribunal (“FTT”), determine any issue relating to service charges and\nadministration charges. This jurisdiction is governed by the Tribunal\nProcedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013 (“the\nTribunal Rules”).\n(iii) DJ Latham determines the issues relating to costs, whether\nclaimed as contractual costs or under the CPR, which fall outside the\ntraditional jurisdiction of the FTT.\nDJ Latham and the FTT have had regard to the decision of the Upper\nTribunal (“UT”) in Avon Ground Rents Limited v Childs (“Avon\nGround Rents”) [2018] UKUT 204 (LC), and identify the decisions\ntaken respectively by DJ Latham and the FTT.\nIssue 1: The Jurisdiction of the Tribunal – DJ Latham\n22. Mr Wragg’s primary submission was that the FTT had no jurisdiction to\ndetermine the claim and that it should be referred back to the County\nCourt. DJ Latham rejected this submission:\n(i) This case was transferred to the tribunal under the Deployment\nScheme. The tribunal therefore had jurisdiction regardless of whether\nor not the claim fell within the traditional jurisdiction of the FTT.\n(ii) Had DJ Latham considered that the Applicant been prejudiced by\nany lack of clarity in the Directions about this matter being transferred\nunder the Deployment Scheme, this is a matter to which he would have\ngiven due weight. However, he is satisfied that no prejudice has arisen.\n(iii) Even had the FTT only had jurisdiction to deal with the claim for\nservice and administration charges, this case had been properly\nreferred to the FTT. It was now too late for the Applicant to contend\nthat a sum (i) demanded as a service charge and (ii) claimed as a\nservice charge, was not a service charge.\nIssue 2: Determination of the Claim for service charges and\nadministration charges – The FTT\n23. Mr Wragg realistically accepted that he could not establish the pleaded\nclaim that a service charge of £703.67 was payable in respect of a\n“redecoration charge”. He conceded that the pleaded claim was\n7\n\nmisconceived. There has been no redecoration or any other service for\nwhich a law demand has been made. The FTT notes that the sum\ndemanded was originally £892.80. The Applicant was not entitled to\napply any sum paid in respect of service charges against this demand.\nThe sum of £189.10 should therefore be credited back to the service\ncharge account.\n24. Given that there was no valid demand for the said service charge, no\nadministration charge could be established for non-payment of the sum\ndemanded as a service charge.\nIssue 3: Should an Amendment been Permitted – DJ Latham\n25. DJ Latham gave Mr Wragg the opportunity to indicate how the\nApplicant’s claim should have been framed. He was mindful that under\nits traditional jurisdiction, the FTT had no power to amend a claim\nreferred by a County Court (see John Lennon v Ground Rents\n(Regisport) Limited [2011] UKUT 330 (LC)). The FTT would rather\nhave been required to refer the matter back to the County Court for the\nproceedings to be amended. Under the Deployment Scheme, DJ\nLatham now has jurisdiction to permit an amendment where it would\nbe in the interests of justice to do so.\n26. DJ Latham granted a short adjournment, after which Mr Wragg\nindicated that he would frame an amended claim under the following\nheads: (i) breach of an easement; (ii) negligence; (iii) trespass; (iv)\nbreach of contract; and/or (v) nuisance. He was unable to produce an\namended pleading specifying the material facts upon which the\nApplicant would now seek to rely.\n27. DJ Latham was satisfied that, having regard to the overriding\nobjectives in CPR 1, it would not be proportionate to permit any\namendment. The sum claimed is modest. The sums expended in\nlitigating a claim which is now conceded to be misconceived, far exceed\nthe sum in dispute. Were an amendment to be permitted, substantial\ncosts would be incurred: (i) The Applicant would need to amend the\nParticulars of Claim and its Statement of Case; (ii) The Respondents\nwould need to respond to the Amended Claim; (iii) witness statements\nwould be required; and there would be a further hearing. DJ Latham\nwould have required the Applicant to bear the costs thrown away which\nwould have far exceeded the modest sum in dispute.\nIssue 4: Costs – DJ Latham\n28. Given that the claim has failed, the Applicant has no right to claim\ncontractual costs under the lease. DJ Latham is satisfied that there\nshould be no order for costs under the CPR.\n8\n\nIssue 5: Consequential Orders – the FTT\n29. The FTT makes no order for the refund of any tribunal fees paid by the\nApplicant. Their case has been dismissed. For the avoidance of doubt,\nthe FTT makes the following additional orders:\n(i) An order is made under Section 20C of the Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985 so that the landlord may not pass any of its costs incurred in\nconnection with the proceedings before the tribunal through the service\ncharge.\n(ii) An order is made under Paragraph 5A of Schedule 11 of the\nCommonhold and leasehold Reform Act 2002 so that the landlord may\nnot pass on any of its costs incurred in connection with the proceedings\nbefore the tribunal through an administration charge.\nConclusions\n30. We have reached the above decisions without regret. Where a landlord\ndemands a sum from its tenant, the basis of the claim must be clearly\nspecified. This is particularly important where, as in this case, non-\npayment may result in further claims both for administration charges\nand costs under the lease. In the current case, the sum was demanded\nas a service charge. The basis upon which it was payable as such was\nnot specified. This initial error was then repeated in (i) the pre-action\nletter; (ii) the Particulars of Claim in the County Court; and (iii) the\nStatement of Case in the FTT.\nJudge Robert Latham\n20 June 2019\nAppendix - Rights of Appeal\nAppealing against the tribunal’s decisions\n1. A written application for permission must be made to the First-tier\nTribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing with the case.\n2.

If the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\n9\n\nfor permission to appeal to proceed despite not being within the time\nlimit.\n4.

The Tribunal grants the Applicant retrospective dispensation from the\nstatutory consultation requirements in respect of remedial heating and\nhot water works completed in February 2024 at Mackenzie House, 363\nLillie Road, London SW6 7PD\nBackground to the application\n1. The applicant landlord seeks retrospective dispensation under section\n20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) from the\nconsultation requirements imposed on the landlord by section 20 of the\n1985 Act in respect of remedial works to remedy heating and hot water\nissues. Those works were completed in February 2024 at a cost of\n£23,221.22.\n2. Further to reports of problems with heating and hot water in the\nbuilding, the Applicant instructed the site repair contractor, Argent FM,\nto inspect the heating and hot water systems. The inspection took place\nand the contractor advised it was a wider issue and a specialist BMS\nengineer was required.\n3. On 06/10/2023 the Applicant instructed Ark MEP, BMS engineer, to\ninvestigate the issue. The contractor advised that an urgent overhaul of\nthe heat system was required to restore the hot water. The works\nincluded boiler parts replacements and testing, safety valve replacement,\ndirt separator air functionality checks on the BMS system, gas leak\nchecks, plant room cleaning and associated works inside each flat.\n4. On 15/12/2023 the Applicant informed the leaseholders that there were\nno feasible temporary solutions and on 21/12/2023 the works\ncommenced.\n5. The application asserts that the works were urgent because the\ndevelopment had no heating or hot water in the middle of winter. Due to\nHealth and safety concerns for the more vulnerable residents, the\nsituation was deemed urgent and the Applicant appointed Ark MEP to\ncarry out the remedial works.\n6. A Notice of Intention to carry out an “urgent overhaul of the heat system\nonsite and associated repairs” was sent to the respondent leaseholders\non 09/11/2023 and two quotations were obtained. The Applicant chose\nthe cheaper quotation provided by Ark.\n7. Mackenzie House (“the building”) is a 6 storey block (including ground\nand basement) comprising 30 residential apartments. The building is of\nrecent construction, circa 10 years old.\n2\n\n8. The lease is a modern type with reference to recovery of cost for\nproviding heat energy to the common parts only [Schedule 7][377].\n9. It would seem the apartments are heated by Heat interface Units\n(“HIUs”) within each apartment. HIU’s are of similar size as gas fired\ncombi boilers but do not need a gas supply or a flue to discharge\ncombustion gasses. The HIU’s incorporate a plate heat exchanger to\nallow heat from the central boiler circuit to be conveyed to each\napartment as and when required. The HIU’s generate heating for\nradiators or similar and domestic hot water for showers, sinks etc. The\napartment HIU circuit and the central circuit are physically separate. Ie:\nthere are two / multiple distinct water circuits.\n10. The individual leaseholders are responsible for maintenance and\nservicing of the HIU’s. The only required Landlord access to the HIU’s\nwould be to check and read the metering and to ensure the central\ndistribution side of heat exchanger was not fouled or blocked.\n11. The HIU’s are provided with a heat meter to record the energy consumed\nin kilo Watt hours (kWh). These are read monthly and then bills received\non a per kWh use basis. The Tribunal have not seen anything to confirm\nthis was the intended method of heating and associated billing charges\netc. The Respondent representative confirmed that heating bills were at\none time received from “Welcome Energy” but after a change to the new\nmanaging agent ”RMG”, the billing ceased some 2.5 years ago. A new\nheating provider was mentioned as “District Heating” which the\nApplicant confirmed is a company that is part of the “RMG” group.\n12. The Respondents’ concern is that this repair of central boilers could be\nduplicate cost if “District Heating” company decide to issue backlog bills\nfor heating. In normal arrangements like this the heating provider would\ninclude a standing charge to all connected consumers (30 apartments in\nthis case) to cover the servicing etc of the main plant and equipment. The\ngas consumed in generating heat would also be off-set by the monthly\nmetered charges. The Applicant could not provide information on this\nand could not provide information as to why the Respondents had not\nbeen billed gas for the heating and hot water for 2.5 years.\n13. The tribunal notes that there are no costs incorporated into the service\ncharge for gas or water consumption.\n14. The Tribunal did not inspect the building as it considered the\ndocumentation and information provided was sufficient for the Tribunal.\n15. The leaseholders oppose this dispensation application on the basis that\nthe Applicants purchased the building at a time when there were already\nheating and hot water issues, that the Applicant should have had regard\nto these long standing problems and should have acted promptly upon\n3\n\ntaking ownership of the building. It is submitted by the Respondents that\nthe delay in dealing with the communal boiler exacerbated the problems\nand resulted in the works costing more than they should have.\n16. The Respondents also submit that the Applicant admitted in\ncorrespondence to them that they would not be liable for the costs of the\nremedial works to the boiler, and further they complain that no details\nof the charges for the boiler were provided because the Applicant took\n£28,000 from the Reserve fund without notifying the Leaseholders that\nthey were going to do this, or providing a breakdown of what that\n£28,000 covered.\n17. The Respondents accept that the works were necessary because they\nneeded heating and hot water, but feel they have been prejudiced\nfinancially by the increased cost of these works having been caused by\nthe lack of adequate maintenance by the Applicant.\nThe hearing\n18. Directions were issued on 06/06/2025. On 23/07/2025 the Applicant\napplied for the matter to be determined at a video hearing and the\nDirections were amended on 25/07/2025 accordingly.\n19. On 11/08/2025 the Applicant’s provided an amended bundle in\naccordance with further amended Directions.\n20. On 14/10/2025 the Applicant submitted to the Tribunal late evidence in\nthe form of four witness statements from Yaasir Jamalkhan, Karine\nNoemi, Adam Norwood and Fainche Blakely. The contents of these 4\nstatements are almost identical and contain 4 paragraphs stating that\nthey are employed by Residential Management Group Ltd (“RMG”); that\nthey make the statement from their personal knowledge, from\ninformation in their records and from information provided by\ncolleagues; that they believe the facts stated in the Applicant’s statement\nof case of 28/07/2024 are true, and that they believe the facts and\ndocuments included in the Applicant’s case are true.\n21. On 17/10/2025 the Tribunal received a document purporting to be a\nstatement from Stan Maczka dated 15/08/2025 on behalf of the\nRespondents. Mr Maczka reported that he was a qualified engineer who\nhad at some time worked on the communal boiler in the building.\n22. At the hearing today the Applicant was represented by Yaasir\nJamalkhan, Senior Property Services Advisor from RMG and was\naccompanied by Karine Noemi, Property Services Advisor, Adam\nNorwood, Associate Direction (Property), Nathan Scutchings and\nFainche Blakely, Property Manager for the building. The Respondent\nleaseholders were represented by Khayyam Jumani, one of the\n4\n\nRespondent leaseholders. None of the other leaseholders attended the\nhearing.\nPreliminary issues\nThe late witness evidence from the Applicant\n23. It was unclear why witness statements with no evidence had been\nsubmitted late and why there was no application for relief from\nsanctions. Mr Jamalkhan apologised and explained that they had\nsubmitted these generic statements so that the witnesses would be\npermitted to provide additional unspecified oral evidence.\n24. Given that there is no substantive evidence in the late witness statements\nto rely upon, and given that there is no application for relief from\nsanction, permission to rely on these statements at the hearing is denied.\nThe late witness evidence from the Respondent\n25. Although the document purporting to be a witness statement from Stan\nMaczka states that he is an engineer, it does not provide his\nqualifications, the company he works for, the company who instructed\nhim to carry out works, is not on headed paper and with no statement of\ntruth, it is not a proper witness statement. Nor is there an application for\nrelief from sanctions. Mr Maczka was not present at the hearing. For all\nthose reasons, permission to rely on this document at the hearing is\ndenied.\nThe evidence\n26. At the beginning of the hearing the Tribunal confirmed that they were\nrelying on a bundle provided by the Applicant of 343 documents. No\nobjection was made. However, after several short adjournments for Mr\nJamalkhan for technical issues with his computer, it transpired that the\nApplicant was relying on a different bundle which they had submitted on\n11/08/2025. Unfortunately, that alternative bundle was not before the\nTribunal, and there was therefore a further adjournment for that bundle\nto be submitted. The bundle relied upon by the Applicant is 402 pages.\nAny reference to a document will appear in this decision with the page\nnumber in square brackets.\n27. In his representations to the Tribunal, Mr Jamalkhan explained that the\nalthough Schedule 7 of the lease permits the Applicants only to recharge\nexpenses relating to the retained areas, they have a separate agreement\nbetween the applicant and the respondent leaseholders to recover the\ncost of hearing. That agreement was not before the Tribunal. It is\nsubmitted that the terms of the lease require the Applicant to maintain\nthe communal boilers and to recharge the cost to the leaseholder\n5\n\nrespondents. In response Mr Jumani explained that the provider of the\nheating is supposed to bill the leaseholders but that they have not had a\nbill for some 2.5 years.\n28. Mr Jamalkhan confirmed that until they took over the management of\nthe building an energy company, Welcome Energy, provided the billing\nfor heating and hot water to the individual leaseholders. When RMG took\nover as managing agents the agreement with Welcome was terminated,\nand the gas supply and billing was assigned to a company called District\nHeating. Mr Jamalkhan confirmed that District Heating is a company\nwhich is part of the RMG group. He could not explain why there had been\nno billing to leaseholders for 2.5 years.\n29. The Tribunal were particularly interested in this aspect of billing because\nif the supplier of energy was responsible for the cost of the heating and\nhot water repairs, that may be relevant to the leaseholders. That issue\ncould not be resolved as Mr Jamalkhan was unable to explain why there\nhad been no billing to the leaseholders for 2.5 years. His view was that\nthis was not relevant to this dispensation application. However, the lack\nof clarification leaves a doubt as to whether there could be a duplicate\ncost if District Heating decide to issue backlog bills for heating. The\nheating provider would normally include a standing charge to all\nconnected consumers (30 apartments in this case) to cover the servicing\netc of the main plant and equipment. The gas consumed in generating\nheat may also be off-set by monthly metered charges.\n30. None of the attendees to the hearing from RMG were experts on the\nheating and could not clarify these issues.\n31. Mr Jamalkhan took the Tribunal to various pages in the bundle which\nconfirmed that there had been difficulties with the provision of heating\nand hot water, that there had been no alternative but to instruct\ncontractors to carry out remedial works without proper s.20\nconsultation. That would have caused delay leaving the leaseholders\nwithout heating and hot water. Mr Jumani for the leaseholders accepted\nthat the repairs had been necessary and urgent because the occupants of\nthe building could not manage without heating and hot water. However,\nhe submits that it was the lack of maintenance by the Applicant and the\ndelay in dealing with the problems that had caused the severity of the\nproblem and consequently the increased costs to remedy the problem.\n32. Mr Jumani explained that when the Applicant purchased the freehold,\nthe previous freeholder was already aware of heating and hot water\nissues. The Respondents position is that the Applicant was on notice of\nthe problems at the time of purchase around 2021 and they did nothing\nat that time.\n33. Both parties agree that there had been 1150 records of faults to the\nsystem prior to the repair works having been carried out.\n6\n\n34. Mr Jumani further referred the Tribunal to an email dated 16/08/2021\nfrom RMG in which it states “I completely agree with you, irrespective\nif the cracks are small, they need to be dealt with to ensure a larger issue\ndoesn’t occur in the Future. Along with the other issues where costs\nshould be covered by the developer and not Leaseholders via the service\ncharge” [Annex V of the 343 page bundle].\n35. Mr Jamalkhan states that that email does not reflect an accurate\nposition, and that email was written without all the relevant facts.\nIndeed, Mr Jamalkhan sought to suggest that the leaseholders\ncontributed to the problems with the communal boiler because not one\nof the 30 flats had correctly serviced the HIU in their individual flats.\nThere was no evidence to support this suggestion.\n36. In relation to prejudice, the Respondents have not provided any evidence\nin this regard, other than their claim of financial prejudice due to\nincreased cost of works due to alleged neglected maintenance by the\nApplicant. They confirm they do not know whether the cost of\n£23,221.22 was good value or not as they had not carried out any\ninvestigations, and make no submissions as to what they would have\ndone had the s.20 Consultation process had been correctly carried out.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n37. The only issue for the Tribunal to decide is whether or not it is reasonable\nto dispense with the statutory consultation requirements. This\napplication does not concern the issue of whether or not\nservice charges will be reasonable or payable.\n38. Having considered all the evidence and noted that no evidence has been\nprovided as to the prejudice suffered by the leaseholders due to lack of\nproper s.20 consultation, the Tribunal determines the dispensation\nissues as follows.\n39. Section 20 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (as amended) and the\nService Charges (Consultation Requirements) (England) Regulations\n2003 require a landlord planning to undertake major works, where a\nleaseholder will be required to contribute over £250 towards those\nworks, to consult the leaseholders in a specified form.\n40. Should a landlord not comply with the correct consultation procedure, it\nis possible to obtain dispensation from compliance with these\nrequirements by such an application as is this one before the Tribunal.\nEssentially the Tribunal must be satisfied that it is reasonable to do so.\n41. The leading authority in relation to s.20ZA dispensation requests is\nDaejan Investments Ltd v Benson [2013] 1 WLR 854 (“Benson”) in\nwhich the Supreme Court set out guidance as to the approach to be taken\n7\n\nby a tribunal when considering such applications. This was to focus on\nthe extent, if any, to which the lessees were prejudiced in either paying\nfor inappropriate works or paying more than would be appropriate,\nbecause of the failure of the landlord to comply with the consultation\nrequirements. In his judgment, Lord Neuberger said as follows;\n44. Given that the purpose of the Requirements is to ensure\nthat the tenants are protected from (i) paying for\ninappropriate works or (ii) paying more than would be\nappropriate, it seems to me that the issue on which the\nLVT should focus when entertaining an application by a\nlandlord under section 20ZA(1) must be the extent, if any,\nto which the tenants were prejudiced in either respect by\nthe failure of the landlord to comply with the\nRequirements.\n45. Thus, in a case where it was common ground that the\nextent, quality and cost of the works were in no way\naffected by the landlord’s failure to comply with the\nRequirements, I find it hard to see why the dispensation\nshould not be granted (at least in the absence of some very\ngood reason): in such a case the tenants would be in\nprecisely the position that the legislation intended them\nto be – ie as if the Requirements had been complied with.\n42. Accordingly, the Tribunal had to consider whether there was any\nprejudice that may have arisen out of the conduct of the Applicant and\nwhether it was reasonable for the Tribunal to grant dispensation\nfollowing the guidance set out above.\n43. The Tribunal is of the view that the issue of whether the works were\nmore expensive because of lack of proper maintenance by the Applicant\nis not an issue for this dispensation application but an argument in\nrelation to reasonableness and payability under s.27A Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985. There are further questions over the billing\narrangement that has failed or stopped for unknown reasons and what\nthose billing arrangements are in relation to repairs. However, as stated\nabove, the issue of payability or reasonableness for the works is not the\nsubject of this application.\n44. The Tribunal found that the urgent repairs to the heating and hot water\nwere required, and could not find prejudice to Respondents who had\nprovided no evidence as to prejudice due to the failure to properly\nconsult under s.20.\n45. As stated above, the only issue for the Tribunal to decide is whether or\nnot it is reasonable to dispense with the statutory consultation\n8\n\nrequirements. This application does not concern the issue of\nwhether or not service charges will be reasonable or payable.\n46. The Tribunal grants the Applicant retrospective dispensation from the\nstatutory consultation requirements in respect of remedial works to the\nheating and hot water system at Mackenzie House, 363 Lillie Road,\nLondon SW6 7PD.\n47. The Applicant is directed to serve this decision on all the leaseholders of\nthe flats in the building.\nName: Judge D Brandler Date: 20 October 2025\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n9"

The Respondent were directed to provide\na Hearing Bundle. References to this bundle (1,275 pages) will the prefixed by\n\"HB.__\". The Applicants have produced an additional bundle which extends\nto 950 pages. Reference to this will be prefixed by \"A.__\"). This includes a\nnumber of photographs. The Applicants have also provided a number of\nvideos. and videos.\n2\n\nIntroduction\n1. The Tribunal is required to determine six applications brought by seven tenants\nwho hold leases at four blocks at Warren Close, Hayes, UB4 0XY who seek a\ndetermination of the payability and reasonableness of the service charges\npursuant to section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (\"the Act\"). The\napplication relates to the sums charged for cyclical works (Issue 1); the service\ncharges for 2023/24 (Issue 2) and the interim service charges payable for\n2024/25 (Issue 3). The service charge accounts for 2024/25 are not yet\navailable.\n2. Warren Close is a development of 24 residential one bedroom flats across five\nblocks. Pentagon House and Welles House have six flats on three floors. Meade\nHouse and Kingfisher House have 4 flats on two floors. The fifth block, with\nwhich the Tribunal is not concerned, is Sovereign House which has four flats.\nAll the tenants pay a service charge of 4.167%.\n3. The development was completed in 1994. The flats originally had wooden sash\nwindows. Northcote Housing Association Limited granted shared ownership\nleases to the tenants. There have been a number of changes in the identity of\nthe landlord. On some unspecified date, Catalyst Housing Ltd (\"Catalyst\")\nacquired the freehold interest. On 1 April 2022, Catalyst became a subsidiary of\nthe Respondent. Four of the tenants have \"staircased up\" and now own 100% of\nthe beneficial interest in their flats. Mr Hoareau is one of these tenants.\n4. The following are parties to this application:\n(i) Mr Nazim Shah (Flat 1 Pentagon House). He acquired his lease in September\n2013.\n(ii) Mr Laurence Hoareau (Flat 2 Pentagon House).\n(iii) Mr Peter Latawiec (Flat 3 Pentagon House).\n(iv) Mr Tiamour Osman (Flat 6 Pentagon House). He acquired the lease in\nOctober 2003. He is a sales engineer. He occupies his flat on his own.\n(v) Mr Carl Jackson (Flat 3 Meade House). He is a special needs teacher. He\noccupies his one bedroom flat with his wife and two children. He acquired his\nflat in August 2014.\n(vi) Mr Gavin Frederick (Flat 4 Kingfisher House).\n(vii) Mr Jeyasingham Puvendran (Flat 5 Welles House). He acquired his lease\nin July 2007. He is a sales engineer. He occupies his flat on his own.\n5. The parties have provided a Scott Schedule (HB.92-114). This raises a total of\n46 service charge items which are challenged. Ms Traynor comments that this\n3\n\nis a \"wholly unhelpful document\" in trying to identify the substance of the\nApplicants' complaints. She has provided a summary of the items challenged\nfor the service charge year 2023/24 and the interim service charge for 2024/25.\nHowever, there are 31 challenges to cyclical works which were carried out\nbetween July and October 2022. Confusion has arisen because the Respondent\ninitially apportioned the costs attributable to the five individual blocks. The\nRespondent then recognised that this was not in accordance with the terms of\nthe leases. The charges were then reissued apportioning the cost of the works\nequally between the 24 flats. However, because of the delays that had occurred,\nthe Respondent recognised that no tenant could be required to pay more; rather\na refund was made to those tenants who had been overcharged.\n6. The three lead tenants, Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau and Mr Jackson, have jointly\nmade a witness statement (at HB.337-344). Mr Hoareau has taken the initiative\npreparing the case for the Applicants. Unfortunately, due to the untimely death\nof his wife, Mr Hoareau was unable to attend the hearing. Her funeral was held\non the first day of the hearing. The tenants were anxious for their application to\nproceed in his absence. Mr Shah, Mr Jackson and Mr Puendran attended the\nhearing and gave evidence on behalf of the Applicants. Mr Osman attended on\nthe second day of the hearing. Mr Shah provided a Skeleton Argument.\n7. Mr Shah complained that it was wrong that tenants who only had a 30% share\nin the equity of their flat, should be required to pay 100% of the service charge.\nThe Tribunal explained that this was the contractual position as provided in the\nlease. Further, it was the standard model for shared ownership leases in\nEngland. If this is considered to be unfair, this is a matter for the Regulator of\nSocial Housing and/or parliament. It is not a matter for this Tribunal.\n8. Ms Katherine Traynor (Counsel) appeared on behalf of the Respondent. She\nwas accompanied by both Ms Mary Walsh and Mr Jordan Corrall from her\ninstructing solicitor, Winkworth Sherwood. She adduced evidence from Ms\nSandraline Kamba, the Respondent's Service Charge Specialist (statement at\nHB.293-303); Ms Samantha Dhanilall, the Respondent's Regional Home\nOwnership Manager for North West London (statement at HB.304-311) and Ms\nSatinder Bedi, the Respondent's Project Manager (statements at HB.688-690\nand HB.312-316). Ms Traynor provided a Skeleton Argument and a Bundle of\n15 authorities.\n9. The Applicants have come together because they are concerned about the level\nof the service charges that they have been required to pay. This has been\ninstigated by the cost of a programme of cyclical repairs. They also complain of\nthe quality of the works. Their attack is unfocussed. Their witness statement\nextends to just 8 pages. Their witness statement does not address the numerous\nphotographs in their bundle of 1,275 pages and the videos which they have\nprovided.\n10. The Applicants are litigants in person. However, they must recognise that they\nmust identify the issues that they require the tribunal to determine and prove\ntheir case as to why the service charges are not payable or are unreasonable.\n4\n\n11. Ms Traynor states that the Respondent's approach has at all times been to\nengage constructively by responding to the Applicants’ queries, providing\ndocumentation, and addressing, within these proceedings, as many of the\npoints made as can practically be achieved. The Respondent approached the\nhearing in the same vein in the hope of a more constructive relationship moving\nforward.\nThe Leases\n12. The Tribunal has been provided with the leases for Flats 1 and Flats 6 Pentagon\nHouse; Flat 3 Meade House; and Flat 4 Kingfisher House. Although the\nTribunal has stated that all tenants are required to pay a service charge of\n4.167%, this is not strictly correct. The lease for Flat 6 Pentagon House specifies\na percentage of 0.04167% and that for 4 Kingfisher House a percentage of\n0.4167%. The parties accepted that these are manifest errors and 4.167% is the\ncorrect percentage for all leases.\n13. The \"Buildings\" are defined as including the five blocks. Thus the 4.167% service\ncharge extends to the costs of repairing, decorating and repairing any of the five\nblocks.\n14. By Clause 3 (2)(c), the Leaseholder covenants to pay the Service Charge in\naccordance with Clause 7. Clause 7 (2) contains a covenant on the part of the\nLeaseholder to pay the Service Charge during the Term by monthly equal\npayments in advance on the first day of each month. The \"Service Charge\" is\ndefined in Clause 7 (1)(d) as the \"Specified Proportion of the Service Provision\".\nThe \"Specified Proportion\" is defined as ‘the proportion specified in the\nParticulars”, namely 4.167%.\n15. Clause 5 sets out the Landlord's covenants. Clause 5(2) is a covenant to insure\nthe Buildings. By Clause 5 (3), the Landlord covenants to maintain, repair and\ndecorate the roof, foundations, main structure of the Buildings, and all external\nparts including the windows and doors (but excluding the glass).\n16. The \"Service Provision\" (by Clause 7 (4)) is calculated by an estimate of the\nexpenditure likely to be incurred in a relevant year together with an amount\ntowards a reserve. Clause 7 (5) provides as follows; \"The relevant expenditure\nto be included in the Service Provision shall comprise all expenditure\nreasonably incurred by the Landlord in connection with the repair,\nmanagement, maintenance and provision of services for the Building…\" and\nincludes specifically the cost of the Landlord’s performance of covenants\ncontained in Clauses 5 (2), 5 (3) and 5 (4). As soon as practicable after the end\nof each Account Year the Landlord determines whether the estimate has\nexceeded or fallen short of the actual expenditure in the Account year (clause 7\n(6)).\nThe Law\n5\n\n17. Section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the Act”) defines the concepts\nof “service charge” and “relevant costs”:\n“(1) In the following provisions of this Act “service charge” means an\namount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to the\nrent—\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements or insurance or the landlord’s costs\nof management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to the\nrelevant costs.”\n(2) The relevant costs are the costs or estimate costs incurred or to be\nincurred by or on behalf of the landlord, or a superior landlord, in\nconnection with matters for which the service charge is payable.”\n18. Section 19 gives this Tribunal the jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness\nof any service charge:\n“(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the\namount of a service charge payable for a period—\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the\ncarrying out of works, only if the services or works are of a\nreasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.”\n19. The Supreme Court has recently reviewed the approach that should be adopted\nby tribunals in considering the reasonableness of service charges in Williams v\nAviva Investors Ground Rent GP Ltd [2023] UKSC 6; [2023] 2 WLR 484. Lord\nBriggs JSC (at [14]) recognised that the making of a demand for payment of a\nservice charge will have required the landlord (or manager in this case) first to\nhave made a number of discretionary management decisions. These will include\nwhat works to carry out or services to perform, with whom to contract for their\nprovision and at what price, and how to apportion the aggregate costs among\nthe tenants benefited by the works or services. To some extent the answers to\nthose questions may be prescribed in the lease, for example by way of a\ncovenant by the landlord to provide a list of specified services, or by a fixed\napportionment regime. But even the most rigid and detailed contractual regime\nis likely to leave important decisions to the discretion of the landlord. A landlord\nis contractually obliged to act reasonably. This is subject to this Tribunal’s\n6\n\njurisdiction under the 1985 Act to determine whether the landlord acted\nreasonably (see [33]).\n20. The Tribunal highlights the following passage from the judgment of Martin\nRodger KC, the Deputy President, in Enterprise Home Developments LLP v\nAdam [2020] UKUT 151 (LC) at [28]: \"Much has changed since the Court of\nAppeal’s decision in Yorkbrook v Batten but one important principle remains\napplicable, namely that it is for the party disputing the reasonableness of sums\nclaimed to establish a prima facie case.\"\n21. Section 20 of the Act requires a landlord to consult in respect of and “qualifying\nworks” where the relevant contribution of any tenant will exceed £250. The\nconsultation requirements applicable in the present case are contained in Part\n2 of Schedule 4 to the Service Charge (Consultation Requirements) (England)\nRegulations 2003. A summary of these is set out in the speech of Lord\nNeuberger in Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson [2013] UKSC 14; [2013] 1 WLR\n854 at [12]:\nStage 1: Notice of Intention to do the Works: Notice must be given to each\ntenant and any tenants’ association, describing the works, or saying\nwhere and when a description may be inspected, stating the reasons for\nthe works, specifying where and when observations and nominations for\npossible contractors should be sent, allowing at least 30 days. The\nlandlord must have regard to those observations.\nStage 2: Estimates: The landlord must seek estimates for the works,\nincluding from any nominee identified by any tenants or the association.\nStage 3: Notice about Estimates: The landlord must issue a statement to\ntenants and the association, with two or more estimates, a summary of\nthe observations, and its responses. Any nominee’s estimate must be\nincluded. The statement must say where and when estimates may be\ninspected, and where and by when observations can be sent, allowing at\nleast 30 days. The landlord must have regard to such observations.\n4: Notification of reasons: Unless the chosen contractor is a nominee or\nsubmitted the lowest estimate, the landlord must, within 21 days of\ncontracting, give a statement to each tenant and the association of its\nreasons, or specifying where and when such a statement may be\ninspected.\nThe Background\n22. In 2019, the development was being managed by Catalyst. The time had come\nfor a programme of external repairs and decorations (\"cyclical repairs\"). The\nlandlord arranged for the development to be inspected by Michael Doherty from\nig9 LLP (\"ig9\"). His inspection report, dated 11 January 2019, is at HB.691-722.\nHe noted that the windows were timber framed double glazed sash units. They\n7\n\nwere in a poor condition with chipped and flaking decoration. Numerous\nglazing units had failed. There were isolated areas of wet rot. He recommended\nthat the windows be replaced with new UPVC double glazed units.\n23. On 5 April 2019, Catalyst served a Stage 1 \"Notice of Intention\" on the tenants\n(at HB.595-596). The tenants were notified of the proposal to replace the\nwindows with double glazed UPVC units. Catalyst balloted the tenants on the\npreferred colour on the inside of the new windows. The external face was to be\nbrown as existing. Eleven of the 24 tenants responded to the ballot. On 12\nDecember 2019, Catalyst served a \"Notice of Estimates\". However, this was\nlater withdrawn. Apparently, the tenants were told that the cost of the works\nwould be some £105k (exc VAT).\n24. On 24 February 2020, Catalyst held a meeting with the tenants to discuss a\nnumber of concerns that had been raised. Ms Bedi attended the meeting. The\nminutes of the meeting are at HB.725-727. Tenants were concerned about the\ncost of the works and the payment plan that was being offered. Tenants queried\nwhether it would be possible to install casement, rather than sash, windows.\nThe cost would be lower. Catalyst responded that planning consent had been\nsought for a \"like-for-like\" replacement of sash windows.\n25. On 23 March 2020, the first lockdown was imposed and the works were put on\nhold. On 18 March 2021, Catalyst held a further meeting with tenants by zoom.\nThe minutes are at HB.728-730. Some tenants against repeated their\npreference for casement windows. They again complained about the cost of the\nworks. Catalyst responded that this should have been raised in response to the\nNotice of Intention. The Respondent had proceeded on the basis of like-for-like\ncasement windows. The tenants queried why the works had not been included\nin the annual budget and why they could not be funded from reserves. It was\nagreed to omit the door entry replacement to save money.\n26. In April 2021, there was a second ballot as to whether the windows should be\nstandard top hung UPVC casement windows or UPVC sash windows. On 6 April\n(HB.1239), Ms Bedi wrote to Mr Shah with estimates of the relative cost of\ninstalling top hung casement windows (£124,137) and sash windows (£153,117).\nThe ballot closed on 14 April. Twelve tenants voted, six for each option.\n27. In June 2021, ig9 prepared a specification of works (at HB.786-791). This\nprovided for sash windows. On 23 June 2021, ig9 invited three contractors to\nquote for the replacement of the windows. Three tenders were returned\n(at.HB.755-7). Ig9 prepared a tender report and recommended that the\nPrincipal Contractor appoint Symphony, who had provided the lowest quote.\n28. In August 2021, ig9 prepared a further tender report for the other cyclical works\n(HB.758-774). Five tenders were invited and four were returned (at HB.775-\n778). Ig9 recommended that Probuild (London) Limited (PBL) who had\nprovided the lowest quote be appointed as the Principal Contractor.\n8\n\n29. On 27 August 2021 (at HB.597-601), Catalyst sent out the Notice of Estimates.\nCatalyst informed the tenants that they had decided to proceed with sash\nwindows. The outcome of the ballot had been a draw. Catalyst had therefore\ndecided to proceed under the existing planning application to install \"like-for-\nlike\" sash windows. Details of the estimates were provided. Catalyst proposed\nto appoint PBL as the Principal Contractor who had quoted £135,549 (exc VAT)\nand Symphony Windows, who had quoted £144,648 to replace the windows. To\nthis would be added VAT of 20% and professional fees of £15,000. For the six\ntenants at Pentagon House, the cost of the works would be £93,370, less a\nreserve fund contribution of £14,688. The estimated cost per tenant was\n£13,113.79.The Respondent offered a 12 month payment agreement.\n30. On 23 September 2021 (at HB.602), Mr Puvendran responded to the\nconsultation. He inquired why the costs had gone up by 50%.\n31. On 28 February 2022, Catalyst held a further meeting with tenants. The\nminutes are at HB.778-785. Fifteen tenants attended. John McDonnell MP also\nattended. The tenants queried the cost of the works. It was again suggested that\ncasement windows would have been cheaper. A tenant suggested that the\nreplacement of the windows was only required because of historic neglect.\nTenants asked how they could afford the works. Catalyst offered a repayment\nplan dependent upon the financial circumstances of the individual tenants. Mr\nHoareau states that he asked the meeting to confirm whether they preferred\ncasement windows to the sash windows that were proposed. 14 voted for\ncasement windows (58% of the total of 24 leaseholders). This vote did not\nappear in the minutes.\n32. On 1 April 2022, Catalyst became a subsidiary of Peabody. On 23 June (HB.952-\n955), Ms Bedi wrote to the tenants about the proposed works. She was the\nProject Manager. She has provided a detailed witness statement and gave\nevidence. The works started on 18 July and were completed on 21 October 2022.\nThe communal windows were installed in the week commencing 28 November\n2022. There is a substantial dispute between the parties as to the quality of the\nworks, which the Tribunal needs to determine.\n33. Ms Bedi sates that the programme of works consisted of the following: erect\nscaffolding; R & D survey; clean roofs; rainwater goods overhaul; Clean soffits\nand fascia; replace windows and doors; mastic, masonry works and cleaning;\nexternal decorations; and strike scaffolding.\n34. The final cost of the cyclical repairs was £364,777.43, namely (i) cost of works:\n£264,331.47; (ii) VAT: £52,866.29; + (iii) Professional fees (15%): £47,579.66.\n£131,000 was funded from the reserve fund. Thus the cost to be charged to\ntenants was £233,777.43. This should have been charged equally to the 24 flats,\nnamely £9,740.73 per tenant.\n35. On 29 January 2024, Peabody issued the initial demands for the works (at\nHB.634-672). The cost of the works were incorrectly apportioned based on an\nequal apportionment of the works carried out to the individual blocks. This was\n9\n\nincorrect. The leases define \"the buildings\" as the five blocks. The cost should\ntherefore have been apportioned equally between the 24 tenants. On 15 March\n2024 (at p.650-660), Peabody issued revised demands. This resulted in some\ntenants receiving a refund. However, the Respondent recognised that it was\nnow too late to issue a supplementary demand to those who had been charged\ntoo little.\nInitial Adjusted Benefit\nTenant Demand Demand\nNazim Shah (1 Pentagon House) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nLaurence Hoareau (2 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nPeter Latawiec (3 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nTiamour Osman (6 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nCarl Jackson (3 Meade House) £10,484.98 £9,740.73\nGavin Frederick (4 Kingfisher) £9,907.10 £9,740.73\nJeyasingham Puvendran £9,513.91 - £226.82\n(5 Welles House)\n36. On 28 April 2024, Mr Shah issued his application to this Tribunal. His main\ncomplaint was the sum that he had been charged for these cyclical works.\nHowever, he also challenges a number of service charges for 2023/24 and the\ninterim service charge for 20224/25. Over the subsequent weeks, tenants\nissued five further application.\nIssue 1: The Cyclical Works\n37. The Applicants raised a number of wide ranging arguments as to why they are\nnot obliged to contribute to the cost of the major works. We can deal with many\nof these briefly:\n(i) The Applicants suggest that the need for the works arises through \"historic\nneglect\". We are satisfied that for such a claim to succeed, the Applicants would\nneed to establish a counterclaim or set-off (see Continental Property Ventures\nInc v White [2007] L.& T.R.4). In particular, any tenant would need to establish\nthat he had a good claim for disrepair during the time that they were the lessee.\nNo tenant has established this. The ig9 Inspection Report, dated 11 January\n2019, does not suggest any widespread disrepair. It is consistent with what one\nwould expect from wooden windows which after 25 years were nearing the end\nof their natural lives.\n(ii) The Applicants rely on Clause 3 (19) of their leases to argue that they are\nonly liable for the cost of any repairs, insofar as the tenant caused or contributed\nto the disrepair by any act, neglect or default. This is to fail to understand the\nterms of the lease. If any individual tenant has caused any disrepair, he has a\npersonal responsibility to make good that damage. However, the landlord is\nrequired to repair, maintain and decorate the Buildings, and this is a service\ncharge expenditure for which all the tenants are liable.\n10\n\n(iii) The landlord failed to comply with the statutory consultation procedures.\nOn 5 April 2019, the Respondent served the Stage 1 \"Notice of Intention\". At\nthis stage, the tenants did not suggest casement windows. Neither did they\nsuggest a contractor from whom an estimate should be sought. On 27 August\n2021, the Respondent served the Stage 3 \"Notice of Estimates\". The Respondent\nhad tested the market and obtained four tenders for the work as \"Principal\nContractor\" and the for the replacement of the windows. The Respondent\nselected the lowest estimates.\n(iv) The Applicants complain of the overall cost of the works. There was an\nunfortunate delay in 2020 which was inevitable because of the Covid-19 lock\ndown. However, there was no need for the Respondent to serve a further \"Notice\nof Intention\". When the Covid-19 lockdown was lifted, there was a significant\nincrease in building costs. The Applicants were a victim of this.\n(v) The Applicants contend that the supervision fee of 15% was unreasonable.\nWe disagree. It is a standard charge for works of this type. However, we have\nfound that the supervision of this contract was inadequate (see below). We\ntherefore reduce The professional fees of £47,579.66 by £1,000 to reflect this.\n38. A particular concern raised by the Applicants, is the Respondent's decision to\ninstall sash, rather than casement, windows. All agreed that UPVC windows\nshould replace the existing wooden sash windows. It is common ground that\ncasement windows would have been cheaper (on 6 April 2021, Ms Bedi had\nsuggested that the cost would have been £124,137, as against £153,117). Mr\nJackson suggested that the cost would have been much cheaper and obtained a\nquote from Safe Style (at HB1,242) of £3,000 to install casement windows in\nhis flat. He also obtained a quote (at HB.1243) of £350 + VAT for use of a cherry\npicker for 7 days. The cost of scaffolding for some 15 weeks was £30,370.\n39. The Tribunal does not accept that it would have been appropriate to use a cherry\npicker for a job of this size. We do accept that the installation of the casement\nwould have been somewhat cheaper, say some £30k. However, we accept that\nthe Respondent was entitled to select sash, rather than casement, windows. Ms\nBedi stated that it was the Respondent's policy to replace windows on a like-for-\nlike basis for possible. The tenants had only raised the issue at a late stage in the\nconsultation process.\n40. Whilst a landlord must consult its tenants, it has the ultimate discretion as to\nwhat windows should be installed (see [19] above). The landlord was required\nto have due regard to views expressed by the tenants; it was not bound to accept\nthe majority view of the tenants. Catalyst's starting point was to go for sash\nwindows on a \"like-for-like\" basis. All agreed that UPVC was a more cost\neffective option that wood. It was only at a later stage that the tenants opted for\ncasement windows. In April 2021, the tenants had been split 50:50 on the two\noptions. The approach adopted by the Respondent cannot be categorised as\nunreasonable, albeit that the sash windows were somewhat more expensive. We\nare satisfied that the Respondent had regard to the financial impact of the works\non the tenants.\n11\n\n41. In their Scott Schedule, the Applicants challenge 31 items relating to the cyclical\nworks. Most relate to the quality of the works. The Applicants have provided a\nBundle of 950 pages. This includes a large number of photographs. The problem\nthat the Tribunal faces is that none of the photographs are dated. The\nApplicants have produced no evidence of who took the photos or the block to\nwhich they relate. They are no more than \"snapshots\". They show areas where\nworks have not been done. These are often small areas in the context of a job of\nthis size. They do not show areas where works have been done to a good\nstandard. Some disrepair may have arisen after the works were completed.\nSome photos relating to general maintenance problems, rather than to the\nprogramme of cyclical works. Many of the defects may now have been remedied.\n42. The photographs illustrate the following:\n(i) Disrepair to the brickwork (A.7-16; 895-896).\n(ii) Broken Vents (A.24-27).\n(iii) Defects to the casement windows (A.31-36).\n(iv) Defects to the communal doors (A.42-57, 815-818, 855-860, 867-872).\n(v) Disrepair to the communal lights (A.58-62).\n(vi) The photographs illustrate numerous defects to the new doors and windows\n(A.68-89, 799-803). The Tribunal notes the communal window at A.73 where a\nblock of wood has been inserted between the base of the window and the\nbrickwork.\n(vii) External fencing (A.396-415. 789-798, 805-815, 864-866, 873-878, 899-\n904).\n(viii) Defects to gutter soffits and rainwater good (A.426-434).\n(ix) Pointing Defects (A.569-572).\n(x) Defects to the roof and guttering (A.575-625). The photograph at A.592\nillustrated the debris which was left in the guttering. The photograph at A.596\nillustrates dirty soffits. The photograph at A.608 illustrates a loose verge cap\nwhich required attention.\n(xi) Defects to the stone cills (A.651-664).\n(xii) Disrepair to the knee high fencing (A.786-788, 803-804,861-863)\n(xiii) Defects to grills (A,907-908);\n12\n\n(xiv) Moss and lichen on the roofs: Pentagon House (A.911-915); Welles House\n(A.918-922); Kingfisher House (A.925-932) and Meade House (A.936-942).\nThese photographs provide compelling evidence that inadequate attention was\npaid to cleaning the roofs.\n43. The Tribunal is satisfied that the photographs depict poor finishes, bad\nworkmanship and areas where defects still remain. Some items are fairly\nstraight forward. For example, there is ample of evidence to suggest the roofs\nhave not been properly cleaned. The same applies to the gutters.\n44. Some of the paint from the external decorations is peeling. The Tribunal would\nnot expect it to be peeling so soon after the works have been completed. The\nApplicants have provided a report from Dulux confirming that the preparation\nis poor . They had sent samples to Dulux for testing (A.781-785).\n45. Mr Jackson complained that there had been a problem of condensation in his\nflat after the new windows had been installed. We note that he is living in his\none bedroom flat with his wife and two children. We suspect that the\ncondensation problem is due to the interaction between the moisture produced\nwithin the flat and the equation of ventilation, heating and insulation. The new\nwindows are likely to have reduced draughts from the old ill-fitting windows.\nWe are not satisfied that the condensation relates to the negligent installation\nof the windows.\n46. In her witness statement, Ms Bedi gives detailed evidence of the steps taken by\nthe Respondent to supervise the works. Snagging items were identified and\naddressed. Ms Bedi also gives evidence of the contact which she had with some\nof the Applicants:\n(i) Mr Hoareau (2 Pentagon House): On 14 December 2022 (at HB.1026), Mr\nHoareau raised a number of concerns relating to the windows and door in his\nflat. On 3 February 2023 (HB.1014), she sent an email to Mr Hoareau stating\nthat the defects had been remedied. Mr Hoareau did not respond to this.\n(ii) Mr Puvendran (5 Welles House): In December 2022, Mr Puvendran\ncomplained that draughts were coming through his windows in the bedroom\nand living room. Symphony agreed to fit a thicker gasket as a matter of good\nwill. The correspondence is at HB.1027-1037). Mr Puvendran was not satisfied\nwith the Respondent's response and invoked their complaint's procedure. On\n10 June 2024 (at HB.1161-4), the Respondent offered him £450 in\ncompensation. Mr Puvendran did not accept this offer.\n47. The Tribunal addresses the additional following items raised by the Applicants\nin their Scott Schedule:\n(i) Asbestos: The Applicant complain that no asbestos was removed. The\nRespondent agree. This item was removed from the final account. We accept\nthis.\n13\n\n(ii) Repointing masonry (£189.81). The Applicant complains that this was not\ncarried out to a reasonable standard. The Respondent disputes this. This is a\nmodest sum which we allow.\n(iii) Removal/Refix of TV aerials (£379.62). The Applicant complains that only\none aerial was removed. The Respondent agrees, but states that this was an\nitemised cost which did not depend on the number of units. The Tribunal agrees\nthat it was reasonable to include this in the contract specification.\n(iv) Clean soffits and fascias (£1,391.94). The Applicants state that no items\nwere cleaned. The Respondent states that this work was carried out and signed\noff. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an\nadequate standard. The Tribunal disallows £700.\n(v) Clean stone sills (£1,265.40). The Applicants state that no items were\ncleaned. The Respondent states that this work was carried out and signed off.\nThe Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an adequate\nstandard. The Tribunal disallows £600.\n(vi) Apply mastic to windows (£5,036.55): The Applicants assert that this was\npart of the basic installation and should not have been charged separately. The\nRespondent asserts that the specification made it clear that this work was to be\ndone by a specialist mastic contractor. The Tribunal is satisfied that the\nRespondent was entitled to take this course.\n(vii) Overheads/profit and Attendance (£23,400). The Applicants contend that\nthis is a vague charge which cannot be justified. The Respondent replies that\nthis is a standard charge in the trade. The Tribunal agree.\n(viii) Rain water goods (£2,480.18). The Applicants complain about the quality\nof the works. The Respondent replies that the work was water tested and signed\noff. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an\nadequate standard. It does not accept that the debris shown in the photographs\narose subsequently. The Tribunal disallows £1,000.\n(ix) Clean Roof Tiles and replaced damaged tiles. The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. The Tribunal does not consider that this work\nwas carried out to an adequate standard and disallow £500.\n(x) External Decoration and Woodwork (£8,225.10). The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. They rely on their report from Dulux. The\nRespondent replies that the work was carried out to a satisfactory standard and\nwas signed off. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to\nan adequate standard and disallow £3,000.\n14\n\n(xi) Staining to woodwork (£5,061.60). The Applicants state that the woodwork\nwas not stained. The Respondent replies that the work was carried out to a\nsatisfactory standard and was signed off. We agree.\n(xii) Decoration to the communal doors (£1,898.10). The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. Although the Applicants have provided a\nnumber of photographs, they have not satisfied us that any reduction should be\nmade.\n(xiii) Replacement of damaged vents (£197.99). The Applicants complain that\nthey have been charged for 15, but only 11 were replaced. The Respondent\nreplies that the work was satisfactory and was signed off. This is a modest sum\nwhich we allow.\n(xiv) Replace sections of knee high fence (£1,600). The Applicants complain\nthat only one small section was replaced. The Respondent replies that the work\nwas carried out to a section of fencing on a client instruction. Although the\nphotograph indicate some disrepair to the fencing, the Applicants have not\nsatisfied that these sections were included in the contract. We allow this charge.\n(xv) Ridge tile replacement and repointing (£1,125). The Applicants complain\nthat this work was not carried out. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. The photographs indicate a number of defects\nand we disallow £500.\n(xvi) Brickwork repairs (£800). The Applicants assert that this was not part of\nthe cyclical works. The Respondent replies that it was. The work was checked\nand signed off. We allow this item.\n(xvii) Fencing repairs prior to redecoration (£450). The Applicants complain\nthat no fences were repaired. In any event, the fencing is not part of the estate.\nThe Respondent replies that minor works were executed to parts of fencing\nwhich fall within the estate. We allow this modest charge.\n(xviii) Pest proof vents (£360). The Applicants initially asserted that no vents\nwere pest proofed. The Applicants now accept that work was carried out to one\nvent but not to an adequate standard. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory. The Applicants have not satisfied us that we should disallow this\nitem.\n(xix) Rake out and repoint gaps to sub cills (£75). The Applicants assert that no\nwork was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and\nsigned off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xx) Rake out and repoint window heads (£75). The Applicants assert that no\nwork was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and\nsigned off. We allow this modest sum.\n15\n\n(xxi) Rake out and repoint side of concrete cills (£50). The Applicants assert\nthat no work was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed\nand signed off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xxii) Repointing of brickwork above rear door of 1 Welles House (£95). The\nApplicants initially asserted that only one was replaced. They now accept the\nneed to pay a reasonable amount. The Respondent replies that the work was\ncompleted and signed off. 16 verge caps were completed. We allow this modest\nsum.\n(xxiii) Supply and fit new dry verge caps where missing (£95). The Applicants\nassert that no work was done. The Respondent replies that the work was\ncompleted and signed off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xxiv) Rebuild bin stores (£595). The Applicants complain that this was not part\nof the cyclical works and the works were not completed to a satisfactory\nstandard. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and signed off.\nWe allow this item.\n(xxv) Remove ivy (£50). The Applicants complain that they have been double\ncharged as this was part of the gardening contract. The Respondent replies that\nthe work was completed as part of the cyclical works programme and signed off.\nWe allow this modest item.\n(xxvi) Repoint 5 window fills (£100). The Applicants complain that this is part\nof the window replacement and they are being charged twice. The Respondent\nreplies that the work was carried out to the first floor cills in three blocks. The\nworks were completed and signed off. We allow this modest item.\n(xxvii) CT1 window fills (£75). The Applicants complain that this was part of the\nwindow installation and they are being charged twice. The Respondent denies\nthat there has been any duplication. The work was carried out to the window\ncills on the first floors at Kingfisher House, Sovereign Hose and Meade Houe.\nWe allow this modest charge,\n(xxviii) Relay dropped tiles gable end Meade House (£1,700): The Applicants\ncomplain that this work was not done. The Respondent replies that the work\nwas completed and signed off. We allow this modest item.\n(xxix) Window and door replacement (£144,648 + VAT). The only issue raised\nby the Applicants is that of historic neglect. We have already rejected this\nchallenge (see [37(i)] above).\n48. The Tribunal have made modest deductions of £7,300 out of a contract in the\nsum of £364,777. Each Applicant is therefore entitled to a deduction of £304.17.\nHowever, whilst Mr Jackson and Mr Frederick paid their full 4.167%\ncontribution towards the works, Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau, Mr Latawiec and Mr\nOsman paid £186.57 less than his full share, whilst Mr Puvendran paid £226.82\n16\n\nless (see Table at [35] above). We consider that these sums should be credited\nagainst the reductions that we have made. Thus we make deductions of (i)\n£117.60 for Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau, Mr Latawiec and Mr Osman; (ii) £304.17 for\nMr Jackson and Mr Frederick and (iii) £77.35 for Mr Puvendran.\nIssue 2: The Service Charges for 2023/24\n49. The Service Charge Account for April 2023 to March 2024 is at HB.371. This is\nbroken down to the 4.167% which each tenant is required to pay. The total\nservice charge for the year was £1,685.53, whilst the budget was £1,586,88. The\ntenants were therefore required to pay an additional £98.65.\n50. The Applicants challenge six items. The Respondent has conceded three of\nthese:\n(i) Communal Electricity: The Respondent has agreed to reduce the sum\ncharged of £176.72 by £88.36.\n(ii) Smoke Vents & Fire Systems: The Respondent has recognised that there was\na mistake and have reduced the sum of £87.06 to £64.24, a credit of £22.82.\n(iii) Gardening Scheme: The Respondent has agreed to a 50% reduction from\n£167.75 to £83.33. The Applicants have provided a number of photographs of\nthe state of the garden (at A.892-894). Ms Kamba stated that the Respondent\nhad made the reduction as a gesture of good will.\n51. Three items remain in dispute:\n(i) Communal Maintenance/Repairs: £42.11. The Applicants had initially\nasserted that no communal repairs had been executed. Ms Kamba has produced\nthe invoices. The Applicants then complained about the quality of the works. At\nthe hearing, the Applicants confirmed that this item was no longer in dispute.\n(ii) Entry Phone: £48.35. The Applicants contend that there was no evidence of\nany work being done. Ms Kamba has provided details of the four invoices which\ntotal £1,160.44 at HB.436. We therefore allow this.\n(iii) Property Insurance: £259.33. The Applicants' complaint is that the budget\nhad included a sum of £41.16 had appeared in the budget, whilst the actual sum\nwas £259.33. The charge in the previous year had been £31.68. Ms Kamba gave\na full explanation for the increase in the insurance. The charge of £31.68 had\nbeen a legacy charge from their block policy. This reflected two factors: (i)\nCatalyst had undervalued its properties by some 50%; (ii) the cover had been\narranged through Legacy who had offered rates substantially below the market.\nLegacy have now withdrawn from the social housing market. Ms Kamba\ndescribes how Peabody had consulted on a proposal for a Qualifying Lont-Term\nAgreement for insurance. She provides reasons as to why insurance has\n17\n\nincreased. Peabody had explained why insurance had gone up on their website\n(at HB.475-8). The Applicants have not provided any evidence that insurance\ncould have been secured at a lower premium. We are an expert tribunal. We are\nsatisfied that an insurance charge of £259.33 is reasonable for these one\nbedroom flats.\n52. It is agreed that the Applicants are entitled to refunds of £194.51.\nIssue 3: The Interim Service Charges for 2024/25\n53. The budget for the year is at HB.550. The Tribunal explained that any landlord\nhas to make a judgment as to what sums should be included in a budget. When\nthe service charge accounts for the year are available, there will be a\nreconciliation between the budgeted and the actual expenditure. Further, any\nchallenge to the quality of the service can only be made at the end of the service\ncharge year.\n54. The Applicants challenge seven items in their Scott Schedule. They indicated\nthat they no longer challenge the figure for pest control (£4.32). The\nRespondent agreed to reduce the sum for communal electricity insurance by\n50% (£105.67).\n55. The remaining sums remain in dispute:\n(i) Gardening: £175.44: The Applicants complain about the quality of the\nservice. Work is sporadic and is not carried out to an acceptable or reasonable\nstandard. The Applicants confirmed that they did not dispute the sum included\nin the budget. When a budget is prepared, it must be assumed that works will\nbe carried out to an acceptable standard. We therefore allow this sum.\n(ii) Smoke Vents/Fire Systems: £183.48: The Applicants state in the Scott\nSchedule that there is no system in place. The Respondent replies that this\nheading covers the emergency lighting system from which each block benefits.\nThis is a 5% uplift on the 2023/24 estimate. We are satisfied that this budget\nsum is reasonable.\n(iii) Tree Surgery: £31.68: The Applicants contend that there are no trees on the\nestate that require surgery. In the Scott Schedule, the Respondent argued that\nthis was only an estimate and there would be a credit if there was no such work.\nAt the hearing, the Respondent took the contrary position. They agreed that this\nsum should be disallowed. If there is any such expenditure, it will be included\nin the final service charge accounts.\n(iv) Audit and Accountancy: £14.40: The Applicants argued that there was no\nrequirement in the lease for the accounts to be audited. The Respondent\nreferred to Clause 7 (5)(c) of the leases. In the light of this, the Applicants did\nnot pursue their challenge.\n18\n\n(v) Property Insurance: £427.68: The Applicants complain that this sum is\nexcessive. The Tribunal has found that the actual expenditure of £259.33 was\nreasonable. Whilst £424.68 had been included in the budget, Ms Kamba stated\nthat after the Section 20 Consultation, the tenants had been informed that the\ninsurance would be in the region of £400. The Tribunal accepts that insurance\npremiums are increasing. However, we are satisfied that the estimate of\n£424.68 was unreasonable. We allow £400.\n56. The Tribunal has made deductions of £162.03 to the budget.\nApplication under s.20C and refund of fees\n57. At the end of the hearing, the Applicants made an application for a refund of\nthe fees that they have paid in respect of these six applications. We understand\nthat they have paid £800, namely 6 application fees of £100 and a hearing fee\nof £200. The Applicants have only succeeded on a small number of points. We\ntherefore make an order that they should be able to recover 25%, namely £200.\n58. In the application form, the Applicants applied for an order under section 20C\nof the 1985 Act in respect of the cost of these proceedings. It is not for this\ntribunal to make a determination as to whether the landlord is entitled under\nthe leases to pass on these costs through the service charge. Section 20C (3)\npermits the Tribunal to make such order as it considers just and equitable in\nthe circumstances. Given our findings, we are satisfied that the Respondent\nshould be restricted to passing on 75% of their costs.\n59. The Respondent has not indicated whether it intends to pass on its costs\nthrough the service charge or as to the level of costs that it would intend to\ncharge to the tenants. The Tribunal records its concern that any such costs\nshould be proportionate. The Respondent has been represented by Counsel\nwith two representatives from her instructing solicitor in attendance. These\ntribunals are intended to be informal and have adopted procedures so that\nparties do not need to be represented. We note that it is always open to the\ntenants to challenge the size of any such costs through a separate application if\nthey consider these to be unreasonable. However, the Respondent is to be\ncommended for the constructive manner in which it has sought to respond to\nthese applications.\n60. The Tribunal also makes an order pursuant to paragraph 5A of Schedule 11 to\nthe Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 restricting the ability of the\nRespondent from charging an administration charge in respect of its litigation\ncosts. However, the Tribunal does not consider that this is strictly necessary, as\nit would not seem to be open to the Respondent to levy such a charge.\nJudge Robert Latham\n29 July 2025\n19\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of appeal they\nmay have.\nIf a Party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), then\na written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nregional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within 28\ndays after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person making the\napplication.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the\n28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide whether to\nallow the application for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the\ntime limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the tribunal to\nwhich it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number), state the grounds\nof appeal and state the result the party making the application is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n20"

On 12 April 2024, the Landlord served a notice under Section 13(2) of\nthe Housing Act 1988 which proposed a new rent of £6,900 per month\nin place of the existing rent of £6,300 per month to take effect from 16\nMay 2024.\n2. By application received by the Tribunal on 13 May 2024, made under\nSection 13(4)(a) of the Housing Act 1988, the Tenant referred the\nLandlord’s notice proposing a new rent to the Tribunal for determination\nof a market rent.\nInspection and Hearing\n3. On 23 September 2024, the Tribunal held a short oral hearing and also\ncarried out an inspection of the Property, accompanied by Santiago\nHerrero on behalf of the Tenants and Stephan von Posern, Landlord.\nEvidence\n4. The Tribunal considered the written submissions provided by both the\nTenants and the Landlord, which consisted of their Reply forms, along\nwith additional written evidence, and similar properties that both the\nTenant and the Landlord asked the Tribunal to consider. Additionally,\nthe Tribunal considered the oral submissions made at the hearing by\nboth parties, as well as its inspection of the Property.\nDetermination and Valuation\n5. The Property was a 19-century end of terrace house that had a living\nroom, kitchen, cloakroom, laundry room, 5 bedrooms, 2 separate\nbathrooms, a walk-in dressing room, an attic study and a private garden.\nThe Property had central heating and triple glazed windows, provided by\nthe Landlord. The Landlord had also provided the white goods, flooring,\ncurtains and blinds.\n6. Having considered the comparable evidence provided by the parties, and\nthe Tribunal’s own expert knowledge and experience, the Tribunal\nconsidered that the open market rental value for a similar property in\nthis location would be in the range of £6,700 per calendar month. The\nTribunal then adjusted this to £6,450 to reflect in particular that the\nkitchen was slightly tired in appearance and the property did not benefit\nfrom parking or an en suite bathroom.\n2\n\nDecision\n7. The Tribunal determined a market rent of £6,450 per calendar month,\nto take effect from 16 May 2024.\nJudge Bernadette MacQueen Date: 7 October 2024\nAPPEAL PROVISIONS\nThese summary reasons are provided to give the parties an indication as to how\nthe Tribunal made its decision. If either party wishes to appeal this decision,\nthey should first make a request for full reasons and the details of how to appeal\nwill be set out in the full reasons. Any request for full reasons should be made\nwithin a month. Any subsequent application for permission to appeal should be\nmade on Form RP PTA.\n3"

This has been a paper decision which has been consented to by the\napplicant. The documents that were referred to, is in a bundle which\nextends to 90 pages prepared by the applicant, plus the Tribunals\nDirections, the contents of which we have recorded. Therefore, the\ntribunal had before it an electronic/digital trial bundles of documents\nprepared by the applicant, in accordance with previous directions.\n2. The tribunal did not inspect the property as it considered the\ndocumentation and information before it in the trial bundle enabled the\ntribunal to proceed with this determination\n3. The application\n1. On 2nd February 2022, Daniel Tang of Judge & Priestley solicitors\nissued a Part 8 Claim in Bromley County Court under claim number\nJOOBR258 seeking a vesting order under section 50(1) of the\nLeasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (‘the\nAct’).This is therefore the date of valuation and we shall return to this\nmatter later in this decision.\n2. On 21st February 2022 the District Judge made an order in the matter\nwith no known terms:\n3. The applicants’ representatives were unable to locate Mr Daniel\nO’Connor.\n4. The application was submitted to the Tribunal and directions were\nissued on 4th July 2022. These provided that the case would proceed\nto a paper determination. None of the parties has objected to this or\nrequested an oral hearing. The paper determination took place on 30th\nAugust 2022.\n5. In accordance with the directions, the applicants’ solicitors supplied the\nTribunal with a helpful bundle that contained copies of relevant\ndocuments from the County Court proceedings, various title\ndocuments, the existing lease and a comprehensive Expert Witness\nvaluation report of Mr Arthur Row Bs (Hons) MRICS dated 4th August\n2022.\n2\n\n6. The relevant legal provisions are set out in the appendix to this\ndecision.\nThe background\n7. The leasehold interest in the Flat is now registered in name of Michelle\nJacqueline Loss by virtue of a transfer made on 3rd July 2002 under\nTitle No TGL70305. The freehold of the building has been registered in\nthe name of Daniel O’Connor under title number SGL8128 since the\n27th April 1992.\n8. The property is a mid terrace Victorian property located in an\nestablished residential area converted to two flats.approached via a\ncommunal hallway. The subject property is a one bedroom flat located\non the ground floor and has not been subject to any significant internal\nalterations. The property has the benefit of a private rear garden.\n9. The issues\n10. The Tribunal is required to determine the premium to be paid for the\nfreehold interest of the 1993 Act and the appropriate sum to be paid\ninto Court pursuant to section 27(1)-(7) of the Act.\n11. The Tribunal did not consider that an inspection of the flat was\nnecessary under current circumstances, nor would it have been\nproportionate to the issues in dispute.\n12. Having studied the various documents in the applicant’s bundle, the\nTribunal has made the determination set out below.\nThe sum to be paid into court\n13. We determine that the premium payable under the 1993 Act is\n£31,870 (Thirty one thousand eight hundred and seventy pounds) and\nthis is the appropriate sum to be paid into Court under section 27(1).\nOur reasons are set out as follows.\n14. In his report, Mr Row valued the premium at £31,870. This was based\non an extended lease value of £325,000, plus 1% for freehold value,\n(£328,250) a capitalisation rate of 7%, and a deferment rate of 5%. Mr\nHow used the 2nd February 2022 as the valuation date which provided\nan unexpired term of 67.86 years. This is correct. The relevant date for\nvaluing the lease extension is the date of the Court application,\npursuant to section 51(8)(a) of the 1993 Act.\n3\n\n15. At that date, the lease had an unexpired term of 67.86 years. The\nTribunal agrees, in view of the fact, the lease has an unexpired term of\nless than 80 years marriage value is deemed to exist.\n16. Having carefully scrutinised the valuation, including the comparable\nevidence, the Tribunal agrees the capitalisation and deferment rates\nand long lease value.\n17. The Tribunal examined the three comparables provided in the report,\nEach of the properties are located in Burford Road and comprise larger\none bedroom converted ground floor flats which are within 300m of the\nsubject. Only two of the comparables have actually completed and 15\nBurford Road is only under offer.and as such less weight can be given to\nthis comparable evidence. It would good practice on behalf of the\nValuer to prepare a schedule which makes valuation adjustments in\norder to provide a precise methodology. Such adjustments would take\ninto account location, internal specification, onsite parking, private\ngarden and indexation for time lapse in comparison (already\nundertaken) with the valuation date. No such schedule was provided by\nMr Row, however, despite these minor misgivings, based upon the\ncomparable evidence the Tribunal agrees with the long lease value at\n£325,000.\n18. There was no evidence of any ground rent or service charge arrears for\nthe Flats. In the absence of such evidence, the Tribunal determines that\nno additional sums are payable under the 1993 Act. It follows that the\nappropriate sum to be paid into Court is £31,870 in accordance with\nthe report.\nTerms of the new lease\n19. We have considered the Deed of Surrender and Regrant incorporating\nthe LR1, and are content that, the Draft goes no further that the current\nlease terms. We are satisfied that the terms should be approved as\ndrafted.\nName: Mr D Jagger MRICS Date: 31st August 2022\n4\n\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) then a written application for permission must be made to\nthe First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing\nwith the case.\n2. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the Regional\noffice within 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the\ndecision to the person making the application.\n3. If the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\nfor permission to appeal to proceed despite not being within the time\nlimit.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the\ncase number), state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\n5\n\nAppendix of relevant legislation\nAppendix of relevant legislation\nLeasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (as\namended)\nSection 50 (1)-(3)\n• (1) Where –\n(a) a qualifying tenant of a flat desires to make a claim to exercise the right to\nacquire a new lease of his flat, but\n(b)the landlord cannot be found or his identity cannot be ascertained\nthe court may, on the application of the tenant, make a vesting order under\nthis subsection.\n• (2) Where –\n(a) a qualifying tenant of a flat desires to make such a claim as is mentioned in\nsubsection (1), and\n(b) paragraph (b) of that subsection does not apply, but\n(c) a copy of a notice of that claim cannot be given in accordance with Part 1 of\nSchedule II to any person to whom it would otherwise be required to be so\ngiven because that person\ncannot be found or his identity cannot be ascertained,\nthe court may on an application of the tenant, make an order dispensing with\nthe need to give a copy of such a notice that that person.\n(3)The court shall not make an order on any application under subsection (1) or (2)\nunless it is satisfied –\n(a) that on the date of the making of the application the tenant had the right to\nacquire a new lease of his flat;

This Statement of Reasons has been prepared at the request of the Applicant,\nMs Keighley Sheppard.\n2. These written reasons should be read in conjunction with the Decision of the\nTribunal dated 2nd October 2018.\nBackground:\n3. The application in this case was received by the Tribunal on 20th August 2018\nand was made by the current tenant, Ms Keighley Sheppard, who first occupied\nthe premises on 10th October 2016 under the aegis of a twelve month Assured\nShorthold Tenancy from that date at a rent of £600 per calendar month\n(“pcm”). It is in response to a proposal by the Landlord dated 4th August 2018\nto increase the rent from £600pcm to £700pcm that the current application has\nbeen made.\nThe Law:\n4. The relevant provisions in respect of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and\ndetermination of a market rent are contained within sections 13 and 14 of the\nHousing Act 1988 (“the Act”).\nInspection:\n5. Ms Sheppard and a friend were in attendance at the inspection on 2nd October\n2018. There was no appearance or representation by Mr Singh.\nThe Property:\n6. The property comprises a first and second floor flat above retail premises\ncontained within a parade of brick and tile shops built during the interwar\nperiod in an established residential suburb of Birmingham some 5 miles south\nof Birmingham city centre. Access to the flat is gained via an external rear gate\nat ground floor level, incorporating a security keypad, and from there via an\nexternal metal staircase leading to a timber decked balcony area from which\naccess is gained to the flat at first-floor level through double glazed sliding patio\ndoors.\n7. The property is double glazed throughout and has gas-fired central heating\noperated by a wall hung boiler in the bathroom. There is no outside area\nincluding in the tenancy agreement apart from the timber decked approach at\nfirst floor level and no garage or parking space, although road side parking is\navailable in the immediate vicinity.\nFirst Floor accommodation:\nThe sliding patio doors from the decking area give entry to the accommodation:\nKitchen: which has a variety of fitted units and both an oven and hob supplied\nby the landlord. Two of the lights in this area are loose and hanging from the\nceiling, as is a broken smoke detector. In one corner of the kitchen there is a\nbare plaster boxing which apparently houses an extractor vent from the\n2\n\npremises below which are used as a pizza take-away shop. The Applicant\nshowed the Tribunal signs of leaking from this vent and gaps around where it\njoins the ceiling and the walls. It was suggested that, during the evening in\nparticular, strong cooking smells associated with the pizza production were\nevident in the flat. The kitchen then leads through a doorway (with no door) to\nthe:\nLiving Room: which is a very irregular shaped room thus making it difficult\nto use sensibly in terms of setting up furniture etc. There are two double glazed\nwindows in the living room – one of which (the bay window) appears to have\nill-fitting units through which the Applicant said there are considerable drafts\nwhich result in it being difficult to actually heat the room properly - despite the\nfact that it has two central heating radiators. Leading from the living room is\nthe:\nBathroom: which contains a shower cubicle with frosted glass window\nincorporating a small opening light; WC; wash hand basin; and full height but\nnon-opening windows to the front. The central heating boiler is fitted to one of\nthe walls of the bathroom. There is no central heating radiator or towel rail in\nthe bathroom\nA staircase then leads directly from the living room up to the:\nSecond floor accommodation: There is a crack approximately 1.5 m long\nwhere the staircase joins the wall of the adjoining premises through which the\nApplicant siad there are considerable draughts.\nAt the top of the stairs there is an L-shaped landing which has a loose light\nfitting and the remains of what was once a smoke detector. There also appears\nto be a small hole or missing section of floorboard to the landing – although the\ncarpet was not lifted to ascertain the precise nature of this. The headroom at\nthe top of stairs is just under 6 feet and is therefore somewhat restricted.\nFurthermore, balustrading on the half landing on the stairs is insufficient and\ninappropriate for a property which might house small children – as would be\nlikely in a three bedroom flat. The gap between the horizontal elements is\nsufficiently wide for a toddler to fall or climb through with ease.\nFrom the landing there is access to 3 bedrooms, although two of them do not\nhave doors fitted.\nBedroom 3 is a small single bedroom at the rear of the property, with one\ncentral heating radiator and a steeply sloping side ceiling. It has a dividing wall\nwhich does not totally separate the room from Bedroom 2 in that it stops at the\ninternal face of the outside wall; thus resulting in a shared window between the\ntwo bedrooms and a gap (the width of the window cill) in the dividing wall.\nVisually there is a degree of privacy between the two rooms but in terms of noise\nthere is greatly reduced privacy. Furthermore, taking the accepted norm of a\nusable height of 1.5 m, the Tribunal measured the bedroom and found the\nusable floor area to be just 5.6 m² i.e. significantly below the 6.51m2\nrecommended in the Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (Prescribed\nDescription) (England) Order 2018 (“the Order”) as a minimum for use as a\nperson over 10 years of age. The size of the room actually makes it suitable only\n3\n\nfor occupation by one child under the age of 10 as defined by the Order. It\nshould be noted however, that the Order only applies to houses in multiple\noccupation and therefore has no direct application to the subject premises.\nNevertheless, its terms provide a useful guide to the sort of space standards\nwhich might realistically be appropriate to bedroom accommodation.\nBedroom 2 is also a single bedroom at the rear of the property and is not fully\nseparated from Bedroom 3 by the partial wall referred to in the preceding\nparagraph. There is central heating radiator in this bedroom as well. The most\nnotable feature of Bedroom 2 however is the continuation of the boxed-in vent\nfrom the ground and first floor, which goes from floor to ceiling, encased in bare\nplaster. There are gaps where the plaster joins the ceiling and holes at ground\nlevel where the vent boxing adjoins the skirtings and floorboards. The Applicant\npointed out to us what appeared to be grease/liquid stains on the outside of the\nboxing.\nBedroom 1 is a small double at the front of the property and is of irregular\nshape. It has a central heating radiator and two double glazed windows as well\nas a sloping ceiling. One of the wall mounted electricity power sockets appeared\nto be loose and coming away from the wall.\nOutside:\nThere is a decked entrance balcony on which there is a plastic garden storage\ncontainer (actually designed to hold garden tools) housing the Applicant’s\nwashing machine which is plumbed from the kitchen.\nFittings:\nThe oven, hob and carpets throughout the flat belong to the Landlord, whilst\nthe curtains and washing machine belong to the Tenant.\nHearing\n8 At the request of the Applicant, a hearing was held at the Tribunal’s Hearing\nCentre at 1 pm on 2nd October 2018 which was attended by the Applicant and\na friend, Ms Dix who was there to lend moral support. The Landlord was not\npresent or represented.\n9 It was explained to the Applicant that the Tribunal was limited to determining\nthe rental value of the property within the statutory framework of the Housing\nAct 1988 and the Tenancy Agreement under which she held it, based on the\nrental value as at 10th August 2018, the date when the new rent was due to come\ninto force. Although it was clear from the papers that there was significant\nantagonism between the parties, it was explained that these were not matters\nwith which the Tribunal could become involved, except to the extent they might\nhave a specific bearing on the rental value of the premises; the role of the\nTribunal was solely to determine that rental value.\n10 When invited to address the Tribunal concerning the rental value of the\nproperty, the Applicant indicated that she did not agree with the £700 pcm now\n4\n\nbeing proposed by the Landlord, but would not necessarily argue with that\nfigure if the appropriate repairs were carried out - which she had reported to\nthe Landlord on numerous occasions but which he had failed to address.\n11 The Applicant indicated that she did not consider the rental value to be even\n£600 at the present time, given the difficulties with the provision of utilities and\nthe fact she had no control over her electricity as well as the deficiencies in the\nphysical characteristics and state of repair of the property.\n12 One of the issues referred to in the Applicant’s submissions was a detailed\nschedule of the dates and times when the electricity supply had gone off and the\nprocess which she had had to follow in order to get it restored, given that there\nis no consumer unit within the flat and she is entirely reliant on her Landlord\nresetting the fuse box from adjoining premises. Ms Sheppard was not sure\nwhether the consumer unit which provided the electricity to her flat came from\nthe adjoining flat (where she believed the Landlord lives) or from one or other\nof the shops below. Whatever its location, Ms Sheppard does not have access to\nit – an issue graphically illustrated during the inspection when the electricity\nwent off and she was obliged to text the Landlord in an effort to try and get the\nsupply restored. The Tribunal was told at the hearing that it was eventually\nrestored some 1 ¼ hours later.\n13 Equally, the gas, water and electricity are not separately metered, and therefore\nany tenant of the premises is obliged to pay the Landlord for such services. Ms\nSheppard indicated that she had repeatedly asked the Landlord if she could see\nthe bills on which his demands for payment for these services were based, but\nthese had never been produced.\n14 No representations or submissions had been received from the Respondent.\nDetermination\n15 The first issue to be addressed by the Tribunal in this type of case is to\ndetermine the rent at which the Property might reasonably be expected to let in\nthe open market if it were let (i) at the date of the Landlord’s notice of proposed\nincrease in rent, and (ii) in a condition which would be considered usual for\nsuch an open market letting. In this instance, the Tribunal had regard to the\ncomparables supplied by Ms Sheppard and the Tribunal’s own experience as to\nrental values of similar properties in the Birmingham area in determining the\nopen market rental value of the Property on that basis.\n16 It was considered that most of the comparables provided by Ms Shepphard were\nconsiderably better in various respects that the Property - some of them were\nin Solihull, (which is generally a more desirable location); some of them were\nthree-bedroom houses rather than flats; virtually all appeared to have\nconventionally shaped rooms; and a number appeared to be in a much better\ncondition and have the more comprehensive facilities which would be expected\nin open market letting on an Assured Shorthold tenancy.\n17 Accordingly, the Tribunal considered that in a good state of repair and\ncondition, with a conventional layout, good quality decorations, carpets,\n5\n\ncurtains and white goods and separately metered services, the rental value of\nthe subject property would be in the order of £600 pcm. However, significant\nadjustments needed to be made to that figure to allow for the particular\ncharacteristics and deficiencies observed by the Tribunal at the time of\ninspection as more particularly detailed above.\nIn summary, these comprise:\na. Loose light fittings in the kitchen.\nb. Broken smoke detector in the kitchen.\nc. Bare plaster boxing in the kitchen housing the extractor vent from the retail\npremises below.\nd. Signs of leakage from the boxing in the kitchen.\ne. No door from the kitchen to living room.\nf. Irregular shaped living room.\ng. Badly fitted glazing unit to one of the windows in living room.\nh. Crack to the wall adjoining the stairs to second floor.\ni. Loose fitting light fitting on the second floor landing.\nj. Broken smoke detector on the second floor landing.\nk. Small area of missing floorboard on the second floor landing.\nl. Restricted headroom on the staircase at second floor level.\nm. Deficient balustrading to the half landing on staircase.\nn. Missing doors from two of the three bedrooms.\no. Incomplete dividing wall between Bedrooms 2 and 3.\np. Restricted height of accommodation in Bedroom 3 and therefore useable\nfloorspace.\nq. Bare plaster boxing for extractor vent in Bedroom 2 with gaps around the\nfloor and ceiling joints.\nr. Irregular shape of Bedroom 1.\ns. Loose electrical socket in Bedroom 1.\nt. The lack of working fire or smoke detectors, coupled with the lack of doors\non certain rooms (particularly but not solely, the kitchen) must call into\nquestion the integrity of the fire precautions of the Property.\n6\n\nu. No separate provision or control of utility services e.g. lack of electricity\nconsumer unit within the Property.\n18 Accordingly, the Tribunal considered these issues required a reduction of £80\nper month from the notional rental value as defined above, thus resulting in a\ndetermination of the rent at £520 per month with effect from 10th August 2018.\nN R Thompson 27th November 2018\n7"

An application was made by West Point Leeds Management Company Limited\nfor dispensation of the consultation requirements of s20 of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985 (“the Act”) in relation to the procurement of buildings insur-\nance for a three-year period, which had been entered into before the application\nwas made.\nTHE PROCEEDINGS\n2. Directions were made by a Procedural Judge on the 15th February 2019 for the\nmatter to be dealt with as a paper determination.\n3. The Applicant was required to file and serve by 8th March 2019 a bundle of\ndocuments with (amongst other items) a statement of case, and copies of any\ncorrespondence sent to the leaseholders in relation to the works, including an\nexplanation and any documents confirming the urgency of the works, any\nquotes or estimates for the works, and copies of any other documents relied\nupon in evidence.\n4. Any Respondent was permitted within fourteen days of receipt of the above to\nsend to the Applicant’s representative any statement made in response to the\nApplicant’s case, including documents.\n5. The Tribunal would determine the matter on the papers received unless any of\nthe parties requested a hearing. No inspection of the property was deemed nec-\nessary. No parties requested a hearing.\nTHE APPLICATION\n6. The Application (dated 17 December 2018) sought dispensation from the statu-\ntory consultation process in respect of a Qualifying Long-Term Agreement,\nnamely a three-year buildings insurance policy.\n7. The Application outlined that the agreement between the Applicant and Aviva\nPlc had already been entered into, and that there had been no consultation to\ndate. Further information was to follow in the statement of case.\n2\n\nTHE APPLICANT’S STATEMENT OF CASE\n8. The Applicant’s solicitor, Mr. Phillip Parkinson submitted a detailed statement\nin support of the application.\n9. Mr. Parkinson confirmed in his statement that the Applicant was the head\nleasehold owner of West Point Wellington Street Leeds (“the Premises”) pursu-\nant to a 999-year (less one day) lease dated 24 August 2005 made between the\nApplicant and the freeholder, West Point Leeds Limited.\n10. The Applicant let out apartments at the Premises on long residential leases,\nsaid to be all on similar terms. A list of the Respondents was attached to the Ap-\nplication.\n11. The building insurance policy for the Premises to the service charge year end-\ning 31 December 2018 had expired. A further agreement with the existing in-\nsurers, Aviva, had been entered into for a three-year period, to keep the Prem-\nises insured at a competitive premium for the forthcoming year, and the for the\nfollowing two years, 2020 and 2021, and consequently this was a Qualifying\nLong-Term Agreement, which had been entered into without statutory consulta-\ntion. The Policy was for the years 6 October 2018- 5 October 2019, 6 October\n2019 - 5 October 2020, and 6 October 2020 - 5 October 2021.\n12. The Lease provides at clause 3.1 that Tenants had to pay the fair and proper\nproportion of the Expenditure as defined in Schedule 4, and Paragraph 1 Part A\nof Schedule 4 provides the definitions for the Services, Expenditure Surveyor\nand Account Year. Paragraph 6.2, Part C of Schedule 4 provides that the cost of\ninsuring the Estate in accordance with the terms of the Headlease was part of\nthe cost of services provided. Schedule 3, paragraph 4 of the Head Lease\nobliges the Applicant to not do anything which would invalidate any insurance\npolicy in respect of the Property and to comply with the requirements and rea-\nsonable recommendations of the insurers and the fire authority in relation to\nthe Property.\n13. Mr. Parkinson outlined the insurance history of the Premises. The Premises\nhas been insured by Aviva for the previous 10 years, and has been subject to a\nhigh number of claims as result of bursting water tanks within individual apart-\nments over the last five years. Claims over the last five years had outweighed\nthe costs of premiums, such that Aviva had made a significant loss.\n14. At the insurers request, an automated system had been put in place at the\npremises which would detect leaks and in the event of a leak occurring operate\nto shut off valves to each apartment to reduce the prospect of water damage;\nAviva were yet to benefit from the benefit of reduced water claims.\n3\n\n15. Premiums had consequently increased during this time, from £79,000 per an-\nnum in 2013, to £200,000 per annum in 2017.\n16. The Applicant’s insurance brokers, Jelf, had commenced negotiations with\nAviva for the service charge year 2019. Aviva were understandably concerned\nabout the loss ratio, calculated by analyzing the relationship incurred losses and\nearned premiums.\n17. Aviva had proposed a £292,000 premium for the current year, but had pro-\nposed that if a three-year agreement was made, and the policy loss ratio was im-\nproved, premium reductions would be offered in subsequent years, taking into\naccount the valve shut off system installed.\n18. There was also to be an increased excess to £1500 for escape of water in re-\nspect of the two options, to be reduced to £500 if a dwelling has had a new wa-\nter tank installed within the last two years which has been serviced annually in\naccordance with manufacturer’s guidelines since installation by a competent gas\nand heating engineer; the said tank must have a maximum capacity of 20 litres,\nand no expansion tank.\n19. Finally, and crucially, the Applicant’s statement provided details of 19 insur-\nance providers that Jelf had approached seeking quotes. Only two of the compa-\nnies approached were prepared to quote and both of these were in excess of\n£300,000 for the year, owing to the high claims history. The Applicant submit-\nted therefore that the Premises were almost uninsurable.\n20. Mr. Parkinson clarified that if a one-year contract was taken and the Premises\nhad an improved claims year, the market might open up to other providers.\nHowever currently no other insurer would quote below £300,000, and Aviva’s\nquote was at least £58,000 below the market premium. Jelf’s opinion was that\none year’s worth of lower claims would be unlikely to reduce premiums offered\nby other insurers; in the event of a further poor claims year the Applicant might\nlose Aviva as a prospective insurer.\n21. Consequently, the three-year proposal, which had been improved following\nfurther negotiation, would see the 2018 premium of £242,061.20 reducing to\n£174,889.22 over two years, a saving of £67,171.98.\n22. The Applicant had covenanted with the Head Landlord not to do anything to\ninvalidate insurance and comply with the reasonable requirements of insurers.\nTo leave the Premises uninsured would be a breach of the terms of the Head\nLease. The Applicant had covenanted with Lessees to insure the Premises, and\nfurthermore was aware of the need to ensure future compliance with the terms\nof the Head Lease.\n4\n\n23. The Applicant was aware of the statutory requirement for consultation, and\nsummarised the process and the time frame involved for the benefit of the Re-\nspondents, and why, in it’s view it was reasonable for the Tribunal to grant dis-\npensation under section 20ZA of the Act.\nTHE LEGISLATION\n24.The relevant legislation is contained in s20ZA Landlord and Tenant Act 1985\nwhich reads as follows\ns20 ZA Consultation requirements: supplementary\n(1) Where an application is made to the appropriate tribunal for a determination\nto dispense with all or any of the consultation requirements in relation to any\nqualifying works or qualifying long term agreement, the tribunal may make the\ndetermination if satisfied that it is reasonable to dispense with the requirements.\n(2) In section 20 and this section—\n“qualifying works” means works on a building or any other premises, and\n“qualifying long-term agreement” means (subject to subsection (3)) an\nagreement entered into, by or on behalf of the landlord or a superior land-\nlord, for a term of more than twelve months.\n(3) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that an agreement is not a\nqualifying long-term agreement—\n(a) if it is an agreement of a description prescribed by the regulations, or\n(b) in any circumstances so prescribed.\n(4) In section 20 and this section “the consultation requirements” means require-\nments prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State.\n(5) Regulations under subsection (4) may in particular include provision requir-\ning the landlord—\n(a) to provide details of proposed works or agreements to tenants or the recog-\nnised tenants’ association representing them,\n(b) to obtain estimates for proposed works or agreements,\n(c) to invite tenants or the recognised tenants’ association to propose the names\nof persons from whom the landlord should try to obtain other estimates,\n(d) to have regard to observations made by tenants or the recognised tenants’ as-\nsociation in relation to proposed works or agreements and estimates, and\n5\n\n(e) to give reasons in prescribed circumstances for carrying out works or entering\ninto agreements.\n(6) Regulations under section 20 or this section—\n(a) may make provision generally or only in relation to specific cases, and\n(b) may make different provision for different purposes.\n(7) Regulations under section 20 or this section shall be made by statutory in-\nstrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of ei-\nther House of Parliament\nOBSERVATIONS FROM THE RESPONDENTS\n25. No observations were received from any of the Respondents.\nTHE DETERMINATION\n26.The Tribunal has jurisdiction to dispense with consultation before works have\nbeen carried out\n27.This was confirmed by HHJ Huskinson in the Upper Tribunal who consid-\nered the jurisdiction for prospective dispensation under s20ZA in the case of\nAuger v Camden LBC in March 2008. The Upper Tribunal confirmed that the\nTribunal has broad judgment akin to a discretion in such cases. The dispensa-\ntion should not however be vague and open ended. The exercise of discretion to\ngrant dispensation requires the clearest of reasons explaining its exercise\n28.Dispensation was considered in depth by the Supreme Court in Daejan v\nBenson [2013] UKSC14 which concerned a retrospective application for dispen-\nsation. Lord Neuberger confirmed that the Tribunal has power to grant a dis-\npensation on such terms as it thinks fit, providing that the terms are appropri-\nate in their nature and effect. At paragraph 56 Lord Neuberger said it was\n“clear” that a landlord may ask for dispensation in advance for example where\nworks were urgent, or where it only becomes apparent that it was necessary to\ncarry out some works whilst contractors were already on site carrying out other\nwork - as with the present case. In such cases it would be “odd” if the (LVT)\ncould not dispense with the Requirements on terms which required the Land-\nlord, for instance (i) to convene a meeting of the tenants at short notice to ex-\nplain and discuss the necessary works, or (ii) to comply with stage 1 and/or\nstage 3, but with (for example 5 days instead of 30 days for the tenant to reply.\n29. Lord Neuberger also confirmed that conditions could be imposed as to costs,\naside from the Tribunal’s general powers to award costs, (which at that time were\nlimited), drawing a parallel to the Court’s practice to making the payment of costs\na condition of relief from forfeiture.\n6\n\n30.The correct approach to prejudice to the tenants is to consider the extent that\ntenants would “relevantly” suffer if an unconditional dispensation was ac-\ncorded. The Tribunal needs to construct what might happen if the consultation\nproceeded as required - for instance whether the works would have cost less,\nbeen carried out in a different way or indeed not been carried out at all, if the ten-\nants (after all the payers) had the opportunity to make their points.\n31.No observations or representations were made by any of the lessees; it would\nclearly be a difficult task for an individual to obtain their own quote to insure the\nbuilding. The Applicant had set out very clearly the process they had followed to\nobtain insurance cover with the best premium and terms available to them in the\ncircumstances, and their broker had made extensive enquiries on their behalf.\n32.It was clearly essential to insure the premises, both in terms of protecting the\nleaseholder’s interests, and complying with the terms of the Head Lease, and on\nthe evidence Aviva were offering the significantly better value cover.\n33. The Applicant provided the Tribunal and leaseholders with comprehensive\ndetails of the problems leading to increased premiums and lack of a wide pool of\ninsurers willing to quote for the Premises.\n34. Steps had been taken to improve premiums going forward by active manage-\nment of the problems giving rise to a high level of water escape claims, which\nought in the fullness of time see a reduction in such claims, and a consequent\nreduction in premiums and the possibility of a wider range of insurance provid-\ners being prepared to offer cover.\n35. No lessee had objected to the application, and the Tribunal is satisfied on the\ninformation before it that there was no prejudice to any of the Lessees. In all the\ncircumstances the Tribunal determines that it is reasonable to dispense with\nconsultation, retrospectively given that the Applicant has already insured the\nPremises for a three-year term.\nTribunal Judge J Murray LLB\n16 April 2019\n7\n\n8"

The landlord/applicant has applied for dispensation from the statutory\nconsultation requirements pursuant to s.20ZA of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985, in respect of repairs to a balcony and the ceiling below.\nThe application is said to be urgent in order to prevent further water\npenetration.\nThe property\n2. The subject property at The Glassmills, 101 Hamlet Gardens,\nLondon W6 0SX (‘the property’) comprises a 2015\nwarehouse conversions into 12 residential flats. The property is\ndivided into 2 blocks with the top floor flats in both blocks contain\nbalconies at the rear of the property.\nBackground\n3. Section 20 notices were previously sent to leaseholders in 2023 with the\nintended works started in December 2025. However, further works were\nidentified as being required, specifically works to remedy the discharge\nof water into the block through one of the balconies and subsequent\nremedial works as identified by Sara Addis BSc(Hons) AssocRICS of LBB\nChartered Surveyors in her emailed letter dated 23 January 2025.\nThe hearing\n4. Neither party requested an oral hearing and this application was decided\non the digital bundle of documents comprising 70 pages. One\nleaseholder objected to the application on the grounds of (i) costs (ii) a\nlack of urgency on the part of the applicant to carry out the s.20\nworks and (iii) the absence of a claim on the 10 year warranty/insurance.\nThe tribunal’s reasons\n5. The tribunal accepts the original s.20 works were delayed until\nSeptember 2024 due to the slow collection of the necessary funds. The\ntribunal also accepts that these further works were not identifiable until\ncommencement of the exploratory work I or about September 2024. The\ntribunal also accepts the written explanation of Ms Sara Addis as to need\n2\n\nfor and urgency of these works in order to protect the integrity of the\nproperty and address health and safety concerns.\n6. The tribunal finds that the concerns raised both directly and indirectly\nby the leaseholder relate mainly to the issue of the cost of these\nadditional works. However as stated in the tribunal’s directions dated\n20 May 2025 ‘This application does not concern the issue of\nwhether any service charge costs will be reasonable or\npayable.’ Consequently, any challenge to the cost of these works must\nbe made by way of the appropriate application.\n7. In all the circumstances the tribunal considers these additional works to\nthe and associated with the balcony were unforeseeable, necessary and\nurgent. Further, the tribunal find the leaseholder who has objected to\ndispensation being granted, has not identified any relevant prejudice\nthat would be caused as result of the applicant landlord’s failure to\nconsult on these additional works, Daejan Investments Limited v\nBenson and others [2013] UKSC 14.\n8. Therefore, the tribunal finds it is reasonable and appropriate to grant the\ndispensation from consultation sought by the applicant, in respect of the\naddition works required to one balcony and associated remedial works.\nName: Judge Tagliavini Date: 30 June 2025\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the Tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the Regional Office which has been dealing with the case. The\napplication should be made on Form RP PTA available at\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-rp-pta-application-for-\npermission-to-appeal-a-decision-to-the-upper-tribunal-lands-chamber\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the Regional Office\nwithin 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\n3\n\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the Tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n4"

The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR27"

Following an objection from the Landlord to the determination of a fair\nrent by the Rent Officer, the Tribunal has made a determination under the\nprovisions of the Rent Act 1977.\nInspection\n2. The Tribunal did not inspect the property but considered this case on the\nbasis of the papers provided by the parties.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 1\n\nEvidence\n3. There were no written submissions from the parties.\nDetermination and Valuation\n4. Having consideration of our own expert, general knowledge of rental\nvalues in the area, we consider that the open market rent for the property in\ngood tenantable condition would be in the region of £38,400 per year. From\nthis level of rent we have made adjustments in relation to:\n• A lack of central heating, white goods and floor coverings\n• Single glazed windows\n• A tenant-installed bathroom\n• The difference in decorating obligations\n5. The Tribunal has also made an adjustment for scarcity.\n6. The full valuation is shown below:\nMarket Rent £38,400 per year\nLess approx. 35% for the following:\n• A lack of central heating, white goods and floor coverings\n• Single glazed windows\n• A tenant-installed bathroom\n• The difference in decorating obligations\n£13,440\n£24,960\nLess\nScarcity approx. 20% £4,992\n£19,968\n7. The Tribunal determines a rent of £19,968 per year and this equates to\n£1,664 per calendar month.\nDecision\n8. The capped rent for the property according to the provisions of the Rent\nActs (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 is calculated at £21,092.45 per year. The\ncalculation of the capped rent is shown on the decision form. In this case the\nlower rent of £19,968 per year is to be registered as the fair rent for this\nproperty.\nChairman: Judge Nicol Date: 2nd June 2025\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2\n\nAPPEAL PROVISIONS\nThese summary reasons are provided to give the parties an indication as to how\nthe Tribunal made its decision. If either party wishes to appeal this decision,\nthey should first make a request for full reasons and the details of how to appeal\nwill be set out in the full reasons. Any request for full reasons should be made\nwithin a month. Any subsequent application for permission to appeal should be\nmade on Form RP PTA\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 3"

That the Applicant, Places for People Ltd, is granted dispensation from\nthe limitation on service charges arising from its failure to consult,\npursuant to Section 20 Landlord & Tenant Act 1985 in respect of the\nworks to the rear boundary retaining wall.\n2. The dispensation is conditional upon the Applicant complying with the\nfollowing terms:\n(1) That none of the costs of the Applicant of or in connection with this\napplication shall be charged to the Respondents, or any tenant of 34-52\nBradley Street.\n(2) That the Applicant pays, within 21 days of the publication of this\ndetermination, a contribution to the Respondents’ costs in the\nSummarily assessed sum of £11,077.28\n3. Notwithstanding 2.(1) above, and so far as it may be necessary, we\ngrant the Respondents’ application under Section 20C of Landlord &\nTenant Act 1985 for a declaration that none of the Applicants costs of,\nor in connection with this application shall be regarded as relevant\ncosts for any service charge calculations.\nApplication.\n1. By an Application lodged with the Tribunal on 7th May 2019, Places for\nPeople Ltd (“Places”) sought dispensation under section 20ZA of\nLandlord & Tenant Act 1985 in respect of its failure to follow the\nconsultation procedure required by Section 20, in respect of qualifying\nworks to the rear boundary retaining wall at 34-52 Bradley Street. The\nfailure to consult was admitted and is not in issue.\nBackground.\n2. Places is the landlord of a block of 10 dwellings built in the late 1990’s\nand let to the Respondents on shared ownership leases. The site is\naccessed from Bradley Street. The rear boundary is a high old stone\nwall with stone and brick buttresses which retains the land of\nproperties to the rear in Aldred road.\n3. In late 2015 one of the buttresses collapsed and part of the communal\nparking area was cordoned off. The wall had been the subject of a\nsurvey by Eastwood and Partners Consulting Engineers, at the behest\nof Places, in June of 2015. We have seen that report.\n4. The Applicant’s version of the Chronology (taken from counsel’s\nskeleton argument) is:-\n2\n\na. In or around 17 June 2015, Eastwood and Partners provided a\nreport on the wall, after carrying out a survey on 3 June 2015\n(the “Eastwood Report”). The Eastwood Report identified the\nneed for some repair work [612];\nb. In December 2015, the wall partially collapsed (w/s Carruthers\npara 6 [603]);\nc. By email dated 11 March 2016, Mr Jim Slack of Eastwood stated\nthat, following the partial collapse, further work would be\nnecessary to repair the wall [627];\nd. In or around 24 August 2017, RMG were served with a\nDangerous Structures Notice by Sheffield City Council [88] and\n[629];\ne. In or around September 2017, the drilling works (suggested by\nMr Slack of Eastwood) were carried out (w/s Carruthers para 10\n[603] KC45 [631]);\nf. Following the drilling works, Eastwood prepared a Demolition\nand Repair Specification (the “Specification”) and a Design Risk\nAssessment, both dated 19 September 2017, detailing works that\nwere required to put the wall back into a state of repair [634]\nand [653];\ng. Applicant urgently sought quotes from four contractors based on\nthe Specification, two of whom responded: PTS Limited and\nFSH Group:\n5. That chronology accurately reflects the basic timings, but there is also a\nbackground, evidenced by the Respondents, as to the management of\nthe events set out in the chronology and, it has to be said, the mistrust\nof Places, by some at least of the Respondents, engendered by that\nmanagement. For example the tardiness, even reluctance, with which\nPlaces has revealed documentation has bred mistrust. The\nRespondents take exception to the description of “the wall” having\ncollapsed, when it was the buttresses. None of the personnel in post at\nthe relevant times are now available to give an account of their actions,\nand it has fallen to Ms Carruthers to give evidence culled from records\nbut not born of first-hand knowledge.\n3\n\n6. Places have employed a professional manager, Residential\nManagement Group Ltd (“RMG”), to manage the development and the\nshared ownership leases. It is apparent that the communication\nbetween places and RMG caused problems at times. Not least in respect\nof who, if anyone, was to deal with S20 consultation, as, for example\nreferred to in the ‘time line’ set out in the letter of 25th September 2017\nfrom Mr. Price of RMG to Mr. Goodrick of No.42, referring to a S20\nconsultation having taken place in July 2016, which, it is now\nconceded, was non-existent.\n7. In the light of Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson and others [2013]\nUKSC 14 , (“Daejan”), it may well be that much of the above does not\nsound in an assessment of prejudice, but it important that the parties\nare aware that the tribunal is cognicscent of some of the underlying\nfactors which make it difficult to distinguish between real Daejan\nprejudice on the one hand and mistrust and a feeling of unreasonable\ntreatment on the other.\nCase Progression\n8. The Application was accompanied by a Statement of Case settled by\nCounsel.\n9. On 10th May 2019 the Regional Judge gave Directions for the conduct\nof the case, including a preliminary recital emphasising the limited\nscope of the application.\n10. The Statement of case of the First Respondent, settled by counsel, and\ndated 10th June 2019 was filed and served. Mr and Mrs Goodrick sent a\ndetailed letter of support dated 30th May 2019 (with attachments). Mr\nAndrews did likewise under cover of his letter of 5th June 2019.\n11. Places replied on 16th July.\n12. Further Directions were given on 2nd October 2019 by the Tribunal,\nfollowing a Directions and CMC hearing held on 28th August 2019.\nThose Directions included findings and guidance which should be read\nas part of these reasons. Permission was granted for the use of experts,\nwhose reports (Mr Kay for Respondents and Mr. Elwood for\nApplicants) are dated 14th October 2019 and 13th December 2019\nrespectively.\n13. Witness statements were exchanged in December 2019. The Applicant\nserved a supplemental reply which addressed mainly procedural\nmatters.\n14. The Respondents sought to rely upon a late bundle of documents\naddressing the management charge on the contract for the works,\nlevied by Places. At the hearing the Tribunal declined to admit that\nbundle into evidence because it was out of time by a substantial degree\n4\n\n(even though part of the explanation for that was Places delay in\nproviding copy documents), a copy of the bundle had not been provided\nto Places’ counsel and, primarily, because the issue to which the bundle\nreferred was one of reasonableness (i.e. Sections 19 and 27), not\nprejudice for lack of consultation.\nThe Leases\n15. Nothing turns on the interpretation of the lease provisions. The\nrelevant clauses are the same in all the Respondents’ leases.\n‘Communal facilities’ are defined as including ‘any external boundary\nwalls...’. Places have an obligation to maintain, repair and renew the\nCommunal Facilities. [Clause 5.(3)(b)]. The tenants, by Clause 7(5),\ncovenant to pay the costs of and incidental to the performance of,\namongst others, Clause 5.(3)(b).\nThe Law\n16. There were no issues in respect of the statutory provisions, which, for\ncompleteness, are set out in the Appendix to these Reasons.\n17. The case law is well established in Daejan. Of particular relevance in\nthis case, and indeed in most dispensation cases are paragraphs 44-47.\n18. 44. Given that the purpose of the Requirements is to ensure that the\ntenants are protected from (i) paying for inappropriate works or (ii)\npaying more than would be appropriate, it seems to me that the issue\non which the LVT should focus when entertaining an application by a\nlandlord under section 20ZA(1) must be the extent, if any, to which the\ntenants were prejudiced in either respect by the failure of the landlord\nto comply with the Requirements.\n19. 45. Thus, in a case where it was common ground that the extent, quality\nand cost of the works were in no way affected by the landlord’s failure\nto comply with the Requirements, I find it hard to see why the\ndispensation should not be granted (at least in the absence of some\nvery good reason): in such a case the tenants would be in precisely the\nposition that the legislation intended them to be – ie as if the\nRequirements had been complied with.\n20. 46. I do not accept the view that a dispensation should be refused in\nsuch a case solely because the landlord seriously breached, or departed\nfrom, the Requirements. That view could only be justified on the\ngrounds that adherence to the Requirements was an end in itself, or\nthat the dispensing jurisdiction was a punitive or exemplary exercise.\nThe Requirements are a means to an end, not an end in themselves,\nand the end to which they are directed is the protection of tenants in\n5\n\nrelation to service charges, to the extent identified above. After all, the\nRequirements leave untouched the fact that it is the landlord who\ndecides what works need to be done, when they are to be done, who\nthey are to be done by, and what amount is to be paid for them.\n21. 47. Furthermore, it does not seem to be convenient or sensible to\ndistinguish in this context, as the LVT, Upper Tribunal and Court of\nAppeal all thought appropriate, between “a serious failing” and “a\ntechnical, minor or excusable oversight”, save in relation to the\nprejudice it causes. Such a distinction could lead to an unpredictable\noutcome, as it would involve a subjective assessment of the nature of\nthe breach, and could often also depend on the view one took of the\nstate of mind or degree of culpability of the landlord. Sometimes such\nquestions are, of course, central to the enquiry a court has to carry out,\nbut I think it unlikely that it was the sort of exercise which Parliament\nhad in mind when enacting section 20ZA(1). The predecessor of section\n20ZA(1), namely the original section 20(9), stated that the power\n(vested at that time in the County Court rather than the LVT) to\ndispense with the Requirements was to be exercised if it was “satisfied\nthat the landlord acted reasonably”. When Parliament replaced that\nprovision with section 20ZA(1) in 2002, it presumably intended a\ndifferent test to be applied.\nThe Hearing.\n22. This was conducted, on 2nd December 2020, by video link and attended\nby Counsel ( Ms Jabbari) for Places and five of the Respondents. Mr\nCullen represented Carolyn Cullen and it was agreed that he would be\nthe principal presenter on behalf of all Respondents, who nevertheless\nwere given an opportunity to add their own oral representations.\n23. We heard Oral evidence from Mr Elwood and Karen Carruthers on\nbehalf of Places and Mr Kay on behalf of Respondents. Mr Cullen was\nalso afforded the opportunity to give evidence by way of\nrepresentations, highlighting the documentary evidence and previously\nserved witness statements upon which the Respondents relied.\n24. Ms Jabbari opened with a brief reiteration of her skeleton argument,\nwhich had been circulated.\n25. Mr Elwood, Chartered Building Surveyor, gave evidence. He confirmed\nthe contents of his report of 13 December 2019. He was cross examined\nby Mr Cullen. He confirmed that he was working on the basis of the\ntime line supplied in his instructions from Places’ solicitors. The earlier\ncollapse was described as a partial collapse of the wall. It was the\nbuttresses. In June 2015 B2 was noted to be in poor condition. B3\ncollapsed in December of 2015. He was asked about Mr Slacks’ email of\n6\n\n11th March 2016, which refers only to deterioration of the buttresses,\nnot specifically the retaining wall, and made recommendations for\nfurther investigative drilling and preparation thereafter of a\nspecification. It was one of the documents with his instructions. He has\nnot questioned the project management costs and, not being a\nstructural engineer, could not comment on Eastwoods’ design or the\neffect of any delay since 2015 in addressing the repairs. The photos did\nindicate that a buttress repair had been done, perhaps 60 years ago,\nutilising brick not stone. Eastwoods were a well-known reputable\nSheffield firm of structural engineers. He was not qualified to comment\non the design. He was opining on the cost of the works as designed and\nbuilt. The drilling reports did confirm the poor condition of the\nbedrock. So far has he could comment, as a building surveyor, the work\nwas required. If the buttresses had been rebuilt with brick there would\nhave been both a material cost saving and a labour cost saving. He had\nconfidence in his Report’s conclusion and costs breakdown.\n26. We elected to hear the experts, back to back.\n27. Mr Kay, Chartered Building Surveyor and Building Engineer gave\nevidence. He confirmed the contents of his report dated 14th October\n2019. He had the documents listed at 2.4.1 of the report. The work\npreviously identified by Eastwoods was buttresses not the wall. The\nwall had not collapsed. It is still there, but re-pointed. If he had seen\nthe Slack email of 11th March 2016 he may have been led to the\nconclusion that 4 buttresses were needed. But it was still buttresses, not\nthe wall. In answer to Ms Jabbari’s questions he confirmed that the\nbasis of his report was the 2015 Eastwoods report. He relies upon their\ndescription but not their conclusions. He was also relying upon his own\ninspection, which was after the works had been completed, because of\nthe failure to consult. Brick had been used in the past on at least one\nbuttress. Stone is aesthetically better. It is a good job and looks well,\nbut those who are required to pay for it have been deprived of a\nconsultation which may have led to a re-pointed stone wall with brick\nbuttresses. He did not believe that the bedrock needed attention at that\ntime. In answer to the tribunal he summarised his opinion that (i) some\ncheaper materials could have been used. (ii) not all the work was\nessential and (iii)the job was over specified, but accepted that he could\nnot be certain because he was not there at the time. He had no issue\nwith the cost and quality of what had been done. The re-pointing\nshould have been done 4 years earlier. Not sure to what extent the\nbuttresses have deteriorated thereafter. Mr Kay also accepted, in\nresponse to a question from the Tribunal, that he was not as qualified\n7\n\nas Eastwoods to comment on the design or extent of the works\nrequired.\n28. Mr Cullen raised the issue of the project management charge levied by\nPlaces (£7713) and the late bundle, which is dealt with at paragraph 14\nabove. This could still be the subject of an objection based on\nreasonableness generally, but is not unreasonable solely by virtue of a\nfailure to consult.\n29. Karen Carruthers, Property manager of Places, had provided a\nstatement (with extensive exhibits) dated 12 December 2019. She was\ntendered as a witness for cross examination. Having started in Places\nemploy only in May of 2018 she was unable to give any first hand\nevidence, but was, from her researches of the documentation able to\nput them in evidence. This enabled Mr Cullen to highlight the\nrepresentations that he wished to make on Places failure to properly\nrespond to Jim Slacks email; the wholly incorrect assertion in Mr Price\n(of RMG) letter of September 2017 to Mr Goodrick, that there had been\na S20 consultation in July of 2016; and the substantial delay between\nthe earlier reports and the commissioning of the works, and the use by\nplaces of the Sheffield City Council (“SCC”) dangerous structure notice\nas a mock reason for urgency in respect of a matter which had been\nongoing for many months, if not years. Mrs Carruthers had\nunderstandable difficulty in giving explanations because she was not\nthere at the time and it is said that all the personnel who were\nresponsible have now left Places and/or RMG.\n30. Mr Cullen made closing submissions. Places have had since the 2015\nreport to address these issues. They have not only failed to formally\nconsult, but have been reluctant, even in connection with these\nproceedings, to disclose appropriate documentation. The 2015 report\nidentifies defects mainly to buttress B2, not the wall. No work was\nundertaken beyond the removal of some, but not all, vegetation.\nFurther deterioration was reported in March of 2016. The design\ninspection was not disclosed to Respondents until December 2019.\nPrice wrongly stated that there had been a S20 consultation in July of\n2017.There was no further work undertaken for a year. Sheffield City\nCouncil were involved as early as April 2015 and is disingenuous of\nPlaces to pretend that one of the reasons for failing to consult was an\nurgency created by the SCC notice. The works were rushed because of\ntardiness by Places. Despite the absence of consultation or dispensation\nPlaces took £8558.40 to drain the reserve account, without regard to\nthe £250 limit. The prejudice is that a more limited scheme of works\nmay have been undertaken if the Respondents had been consulted. A\nless expensive method (Brick not stone) may have been adopted. The\n8\n\nsituation had been made worse by delay and mishandling on Places\npart. Places conduct is more serious than mere failure.\n31. Ms Jabbari made closing submissions. Both Eastwoods and Ellwood\nare competent in their respective fields. To describe the condition of\nthe structure as a ‘wall’ without differentiating its parts (buttresses and\nretainer) is not prejudicial. The nature and extent of the disrepair is\nevident in the reports and emails. Further defects were apparent when\nvegetation removed. Eastwood’s evidence (both the Report, Mr Slack’s\nemail and the specification) is as a result of an actual survey. In the\nevent, today, it transpires that the issue is not primarily that what was\ndone was too expensive or that such expense may have been avoided by\na more leisurely and consultative tendering process. The issue seems to\nbe that a better, or at least, more expensive, amount of work than was\nstrictly necessary was specified, and that the need for such work was\nexacerbated by delay. Places were entitled to consider the aesthetic\nappearance and kerb appeal even though the dwellings themselves are\nbrick built. There is no sufficiently particularised evidence of the costs\nsavings of brick buttresses, and such evidence as there is indicated a\nsmall prejudice, even if it could be assumed that consultation would\nhave led to the brick, rather than stone, solution. The evidence, when\napplied to the dicta in Daejan does not justify a dismissal of the\napplication by Places nor a reduction on the basis of S20 failures. The\nlandlord would have been likely to do as it has, in the light of\nEastwood’s advice, even if consultation had taken place.\nCosts.\n32. Ms Jabbari conceded that normally a Section 20c Order would be\nappropriate, but this case had been protracted by the Respondents’\nfailure to limit matters to Dispensation issues. Places should be at\nliberty without restriction to charge the £25,579 set out in the costs\nschedule provided. Even though Daejan contemplated a term of\ndispensation may well include the payment of at least some of the\nRespondents cost of taking advice and experts, that would not be\njustified in this case.\n33. Mr Cullen replied that this whole saga had been badly handled by\nPlaces. There had been a failure to comply with Directions, particularly\nwith regard to full and frank disclosure. The purported S20\nconsultation in July 2016 was a fiction. Place had not been able to call\nany first hand evidence from those who were responsible, since 2015, to\nbe accountable. The disclosure issues were particularly costly. Total\nRespondents costs are £25,707, despite having dis-instructed solicitors\nand counsel, pre hearing, to save costs. The Tribunal asked for a\nbreakdown to be provided to Places and the Tribunal for consideration\nafter determination of the substantive application.\n9\n\nDetermination.\n34. We reminded ourselves of the dicta in Daejan and its application in\nother cases, especially in the Upper Tribunal.\n35. The quality and cost of the works, as actually carried out, are not in\nissue. Both experts agree. There is an issue as to the reasonableness of a\nsecond layer of management charges of £7713, over and above the\ncontract management of 4 site visits offered by Eastwoods at £1,400\nplus vat. That is claimed by Places under the Lease terms and would\nnot have been the subject of consultation in any event. It still open to\nchallenge via S 19. The Lease terms cannot exclude the Tribunal’s\njurisdiction in that regard. It is not a prejudice arising from failure to\nconsult. It may or may not be unreasonably incurred, about which\nevidence could be led in an appropriate application.\n36. The issue , therefore is whether or not the extent of the works has been\ngreater than it would have been, had there been S20 consultation, such\nthat the Respondents are being called upon to pay for inappropriate\nworks.\n37. The Respondents succeed in properly raising and evidencing the\npotential for prejudice. The amounts are large – more than £100,000\noverall. The works are extensive and capable of being carried out in\nmore than one way. There was not even any significant informal\nconsultation.\n38. We appreciate how the Respondents feel aggrieved at the management\nstyle adopted by Places and RMG, but even a serious failure is not a\nreason, of itself, to assume prejudice. Mr Cullen, in closing, said that\nsuch serious failure was not contemplated by the Supreme Court.\n39. Paragraphs 46 & 47 of Daejan clearly contemplate that issue, and states\nthat such distinctions are not sensible, save in relation to the prejudice\nit causes.\n40. The prima facia case raised by the Respondents is that, in Mr Kays’\nopinion, the inclusion of the works to enhance the sandstone bedrock\nwas not essential and bricks could have been used for Buttresses.\nAlthough Mr Kay has some experience in structural engineering he is a\nChartered Buildings Surveyor and Engineer, not a Structural Engineer.\nIn response to a question from the Tribunal he conceded that\nEastwoods were more qualified to comment on the design aspects of\nthe works required. Eastwoods, whose report Places accepted and\nrelied upon, are Consulting Structural Engineers. That report, and the\nsubsequent advice in the light of the drilling report, sets out a\nreasonable solution to the problem, which Places were entitled to\naccept. The provisions of S20 provide a right to be consulted and for\n10\n\nrepresentations to be taken into account. They do not override the\nprovision in the Lease which empower (in fact impose a duty upon) a\nlandlord to undertake such works as it thinks reasonable. .\n41. Mr Frazer Andrew’s 5th June 2019 letter of representations in these\nproceedings succinctly sets out the representations that could and\nwould have been made if S20 had been followed. It is our view, on the\nevidence before us, that Places would have proceeded as they have\ndone, even if those representations had been made. The wall and\nstructures had partially (the Buttresses) collapsed. It was in severe\ndisrepair. It retained a significantly higher area of land upon which\ndwellings are built. The Drilling report indicated voids and softness in\nthe sandstone bedrock. They wished to retain the visual amenity of\nstone along the whole structure.\n42. There is a potential issue as to whether Places had properly fulfilled\ntheir repairing obligations in previous years, thereby necessitating\nmore extensive and expensive repairs and rebuilding. On their own\nstrong evidence, justifying the extent of the works, it is clear the wall\nand buttresses were in disrepair even before 2015. That is an issue of\nreasonableness not related to prejudice arising from a failure to\nconsult.\n43. One of the prominent aspects of consultation is the right to nominate\ncontractors from whom estimates may be obtained. The loss of this\nright in this case is not an issue, as the issue is the extent, not the cost,\nof the work. That is also germane to the issue of the purported urgency\nof obtaining estimates and requiring a short time scale for\ncommencement. The existence of the SCC formal notice, after such a\nlong delay on the part of Places and RMG, provides what appears to be\nan opportunistic excuse grater than a substantive reason for not\nconsulting. However much that may annoy the Respondents it does\nnot, in this case, give rise to financial prejudice.\n44. For the above reasons we grant the application for dispensation.\nCosts.\n45. This application was necessary because of the failures of Places and\nRMG. Although the hearing and some of the evidence presented by\nunrepresented Respondents may have strayed beyond the strictly\nrelevant, it cannot be said that they have done anything beyond\nproperly raising and evidencing issues that they were entitled to have\ntested. Issues of disclosure have been dealt with by the Applicants and\nthose advising them in an unsympathetic manner. It would be unjust\nand disproportionate to make any award of costs against the\nRespondents and further it would ne unjust and inequitable for any of\n11\n\nPlaces costs incurred or to be incurred in connection with these\nproceedings to be regarded as relevant costs for service charge\npurposes. We make a S20C Order accordingly.\n46. The Respondents seek their costs. A breakdown has been supplied. We\nare aware of the existence, but not the contents, of a without prejudice\nletter re costs received at the Tribunal Office after the hearing from the\nRespondents. We will consider it only after finalising this provisional\ndetermination.\n47. We are presently minded to follow the guidance in Daejan to make\nDispensation conditional upon a contribution, covering legal advice\nand reasonable experts’ fees, by the Applicant to the Respondents costs.\n48. Having considered the post-hearing letter, it appears to be part of a\ncorrespondence dealing with possible settlement. It does not change\nour provisional view. Daejan does not say that a Respondent should\nhave all their costs of a Dispensation application, including a hearing.\nThe Tribunal is not a costs shifting forum, except in very limited\ncircumstances which do not apply in this case.\n49. Payment to cover the Respondents’ reasonable fees for legal advice and\nexpert evidence is what is contemplated by Daejan, not full\nreimbursement for a fully contested hearing. We have considered the\nbreakdown of cost of both parties. They are not dissimilar. The\nRespondents solicitors had resort to Counsel for drafting the Reply and\nattending the Directions hearing. Counsel Fees of £1740 are\nreasonable. A provision for up to 20 hours ( taking instructions,\nreading and research, preliminary advice, instructing experts, further\nadvice, instructing Counsel) by the solicitors for doing the Daejan work\nat £175 per hour gives a figure of £4,200. Mr Kay charged £3217.28 for\nhis initial investigations and Report and £1920 for opining at the\nhearing. Those three elements are the limit of the costs provisions\ncontemplated by Daejan. £11,077.28 in total.\nTribunal Judge Martin Simpson\n15th December 2020\n12\n\nAPPENDIX\nSection 20.Limitation of service charges: consultation requirements\n(1)Where this section applies to any qualifying works or qualifying long term\nagreement, the relevant contributions of tenants are limited in accordance with\nsubsection (6) or (7) (or both) unless the consultation requirements have been\neither—\n(a)complied with in relation to the works or agreement, or\n(b)dispensed with in relation to the works or agreement by (or on appeal from) the\nappropriate tribunal.\n(2)In this section “relevant contribution”, in relation to a tenant and any works or\nagreement, is the amount which he may be required under the terms of his lease to\ncontribute (by the payment of service charges) to relevant costs incurred on carrying\nout the works or under the agreement.\n(3)This section applies to qualifying works if relevant costs incurred on carrying out\nthe works exceed an appropriate amount.\n(4)The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that this section applies to a\nqualifying long term agreement—\n(a)if relevant costs incurred under the agreement exceed an appropriate amount, or\n(b)if relevant costs incurred under the agreement during a period prescribed by the\nregulations exceed an appropriate amount.\n(5)An appropriate amount is an amount set by regulations made by the Secretary of\nState; and the regulations may make provision for either or both of the following to\nbe an appropriate amount—\n(a)an amount prescribed by, or determined in accordance with, the regulations, and\n(b)an amount which results in the relevant contribution of any one or more tenants\nbeing an amount prescribed by, or determined in accordance with, the regulations.\n(6)Where an appropriate amount is set by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (5),\nthe amount of the relevant costs incurred on carrying out the works or under the\nagreement which may be taken into account in determining the relevant\ncontributions of tenants is limited to the appropriate amount.\n(7)Where an appropriate amount is set by virtue of paragraph (b) of that subsection,\nthe amount of the relevant contribution of the tenant, or each of the tenants, whose\n13\n\nrelevant contribution would otherwise exceed the amount prescribed by, or\ndetermined in accordance with, the regulations is limited to the amount so\nprescribed or determined.\n20ZAConsultation requirements: supplementary\n(1)Where an application is made to the appropriate tribunal for a determination to\ndispense with all or any of the consultation requirements in relation to any qualifying\nworks or qualifying long term agreement, the tribunal may make the determination if\nsatisfied that it is reasonable to dispense with the requirements.\n(2)In section 20 and this section—\n• “qualifying works” means works on a building or any other premises, and\n• “qualifying long term agreement” means (subject to subsection (3)) an\nagreement entered into, by or on behalf of the landlord or a superior landlord, for a\nterm of more than twelve months.\n(3)The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that an agreement is not a\nqualifying long term agreement—\n(a)if it is an agreement of a description prescribed by the regulations, or\n(b)in any circumstances so prescribed.\n(4)In section 20 and this section “the consultation requirements” means\nrequirements prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State.\n(5)Regulations under subsection (4) may in particular include provision requiring\nthe landlord—\n(a)to provide details of proposed works or agreements to tenants or the recognised\ntenants’ association representing them,\n(b)to obtain estimates for proposed works or agreements,\n(c)to invite tenants or the recognised tenants’ association to propose the names of\npersons from whom the landlord should try to obtain other estimates,\n(d)to have regard to observations made by tenants or the recognised tenants’\nassociation in relation to proposed works or agreements and estimates, and\n(e)to give reasons in prescribed circumstances for carrying out works or entering into\nagreements.\n(6)Regulations under section 20 or this section—\n(a)may make provision generally or only in relation to specific cases, and\n14\n\n(b)may make different provision for different purposes.\n(7)Regulations under section 20 or this section shall be made by statutory\ninstrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either\nHouse of Parliament.\n15"

The Applicant seeks a determination pursuant to s.27A of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) [and Schedule 11 to the\nCommonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”)] as to\nthe amount of service charges and (where applicable) administration\ncharges payable by the Applicant in respect of the service charge years\n2019 to 2024.\nThe hearing\n2. No appearance was made in person for the Applicant who relied on the\nwritten evidence supplied. The Respondent was barred from presenting\nevidence and did not appear. Two Directors of the Respondent Company\nappeared in response to witness summonses. In the absence of the\nApplicant or a representative the tribunal did not question the witnesses\nas the Applicant would not have had the opportunity to respond. The\nwitnesses were therefore released.\nThe background\n3. Neither party requested an inspection and the tribunal did not consider\nthat one was necessary, nor would it have been proportionate to the\nissues in dispute.\n4. The Applicant holds a long lease of the property which requires the\nlandlord to provide services and the tenant to contribute towards their\ncosts by way of a variable service charge. The specific provisions of the\nlease and will be referred to below, where appropriate.\n5. Lansdowne Court is a block of 54 flats with the applicants flat being held\non a lease for a term of 969 years from 20 January 1967 with a ground\nrent and service charge payable. The lessee is responsible for a 1/54 share\nof the services listed in the lease. The freehold of the block is now owned\nby a resident’s management company with each leaseholder being a\nshareholder in the company. The tribunal made a previous decision in\nJuly 2009 between the same parties and the tribunal noted at that time\n2\n\nthat the Applicant had previously been a director of the Respondent. The\ntribunal also said\n“The Tribunal also feels that the Respondent's actions in trying to\nrecover costs via the service charge — whilst misconceived legally —\nseem to have been carried out in good faith, and that this is a situation\nwhich is very far removed from that of a private commercial landlord\nseeking to exploit its tenants.”\n6. The tribunal agrees with that comment particularly where the\nshareholders of the company and the leaseholders are one and the same.\nThe costs of running the building are paid by the residents and whether\nthat is under the heading of service charge or a shareholders levy, the\neffect is the same. However the tribunal also agrees with the further\ncomment of the 2009 tribunal that “while that arguably affects the\nflavour of what the Respondent is trying to achieve it does not entitle\nthe Respondent to disregard the terms of the lease in order to justify\ncharging leaseholders for any expenditure incurred”\n7. The tribunal also notes that despite employing professional managing\nagents, the respondent was unable to supply even the most basic\ninformation in response to the directions of the tribunal. This resulted in\nthe Respondent being barred from appearing and the two directors being\nsummoned to appear.\nDirections\n8. The tribunal issued directions on 3 December 2024. On 22 January 2025\nthe tribunal gave notice that it was minded to bar the Respondent\npursuant to rules 9(3), 9 (7) and rule 8 of the Tribunal (Procedure) (First-\ntier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013 due to non-compliance\nwith the disclosure obligations. Amended directions were made on 20\nFebruary 2025 due to further non-compliance by the Respondent with\nthe directions and the amended directions included a statement\nautomatically barring the Respondents if there was any further default.\nFurther directions were issued on 19 March 2025 for a hearing on 16\nJune 2025 on the basis of the Applicants documents. The Respondent\nwas barred from contesting the proceedings but was still under an\nobligation to provide documents and information. The tribunal also\nissued witness summonses to Paul Harper and Garry Wells requiring\nthem to attend the hearing to give evidence and to produce any records\nthey had concerning the subject property.\nThe issues\n9. The tribunal has considered all of the documents provided and has made\ndeterminations on the various issues as follows. The Applicant has\npresented evidence in the form of various heads of dispute in relation to\n3\n\neach of the years and has provided overall arguments on a number of\nissues related to those items.\n10. The table below sets out the items challenged by reference to the amount\nshown in the annual accounts with the Applicant liable for a 1/54 share.\nThe Applicant also sets out a number of arguments under general\nheadings\nDefault and charges not proven\n11. The Applicant reserves the right to inspect account records for every\nexpenditure item and also until such time as an inspection is facilitated\nhe is unable to agree any applications for payment are payable.\n12. The Applicant also asserts it is the respondent’s duty to supply strict\nproof that every service charge item claimed is chargeable under the\nterms of the lease, that the service was reasonable and that the costs\nincurred were also reasonable. He further asserts that the respondent\nhas failed to verify expenditure is compliant with the terms of the lease\nand or statute and that the service charge summaries created by qualified\naccountants do not assess the validity of the charges within the terms of\nthe lease or statute. Accordingly he is not liable to meet unproven\ndemands for payment\nThe tribunal’s decision\n13. The tribunal does not accept this interpretation. The Upper Tribunal\nheld in Enterprise Home Developments LLP Enterprise Home\nDevelopments LLP v Adam [2020] UKUT 0151 (LC) at paragraph 28 that\nit is for the party disputing the reasonableness of sums claimed to\nestablish a prima facie case. Where the sums claimed do not appear\nunreasonable and there is only limited evidence that the same services\ncould have been provided more cheaply, the FTT is not required to adopt\n4\nite m\np re 2 0 1 9\no w e d b y re s p o n d e n t to s e rv ic e\nc h a rg e fu n d\na d v a n c e a p p lic a tio n fo r p a y m e n t\nre s e rv e fu n d (p ro v is io n fo r fu tu re )\nd o c u m e n t s to ra g e\no th e r p ro fe s s io n a l fe e s\nH & S ris k a s s e s s m e n t\na d m in is tra tio n fe e\na s b e s to s s u rv e y\no th e r m a n a g e m e n t fe e s\ns u n d ry e x p e n s e s\nF T T s e ttle m e n t\nin s u ra n c e c la im s\np o s ta g e a n d p h o to c o p y in g\nle g a l a n d s ta tu to ry fe e s\n£\n£\n3\n3\n,0\n,0\n2\n2\n1\n1\n.0\n.0\n0\n0\n£\n£££££££££\n£\n4 ,1 2\n1 ,7 5\n1 0 ,5 0\n3\n8 7\n1 ,9 6\n2 2\n2 6\n2 5\n1\n1 9 ,9 8\n2\n1\n030221423\n8\n0 1 9\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n£\n£\n££\n£\n£\n1 1 ,4 5\n1 ,7 5\n3 6\n9 1\n3\n1\n1 4 ,5 2\n2\n7\n0\n0\n16\n0\n4\n0 2 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n£\n£££\n£££\n£\n1 1 ,1 7\n1 ,7 5\n4 9\n1 ,1 7\n4 7\n6 1\n9\n4 ,2 1\n1 9 ,9 8\n2\n4\n0\n243\n393\n8\n0 2 1\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n£\n£\n£\n££\n£\n2\n1 5 ,1 7 5\n1 ,7 5 0\n1 ,8 4 0\n8\n1 5 ,3 4 9\n3 0\n3 4 ,1 5 2\n0 2 2\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n££\n£\n£\n£\n£\n1 6 ,4\n1 ,7\n1 ,0\n3 ,1\n1\n2 ,4\n2 4 ,9\n0\n50\n9\n9\n2\n6\n2\n2\n00\n5\n7\n2\n6\n0 2 3\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n£\n£\n£££\n1 7 ,1 1\n2 ,7 5\n2\n5\n4 ,5 7\n2 4 ,5 1\n2\n0\n0\n5\n443\n0 2 4\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n\na sceptical approach. This leaves the question of whether any item of\nexpenditure is outside the service charge provisions.\n14. The obligation on the Respondent to demonstrate that service charges\nare reasonable and payable only arises if the Applicant can establish that\na prime facie case exists and this does not operate to give blanket right\nto refuse payment.\nCharges not particularised\n15. The Applicant states that the previously published annual accounts\nsummaries is all the Respondent offers as evidence of service charges.\nThe Applicant asserts it is lawful to withhold service charge payments\nuntil the Respondent discloses fully particularised expenditure accounts\nand facilitates the Applicant’s inspection of the details of the same.\nPrevious cases against the Respondent resulted in disclosure and\nexamination of particularised expenditure accounts which led to awards\nbeing made against the Respondent. As a result of the Respondents\nrecord it is not unreasonable to require the Respondent to supply\nparticularised proof of the legitimacy of their service charge claims.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n16. The tribunal does not agree with the applicant’s assertions. As stated\nunder the previous heading it is for the Applicant to establish a prima\nfacie case that a service charge item is not reasonable or payable before\nthe burden of proof switches to the Respondent.\nApplication for payment made before expenditure\n17. The Applicant says that the service charge is ascertained in arrears as the\nlease requires that an account of service charge expenditure is produced\nat the end of the Respondents financial year.\n18. Clause 2.(3)(ii)(a) provides that the amount of service charge shall be\nascertained and certified by the lessor’s auditors or accountants or\nmanaging agents… So soon after the end of the lessor’s financial year is\nmaking practicable…\n19. Clause 2.(3)(ii)(g) provides for a an account of the service charge payable\nto be provided after the expenditure has been certified giving credit for\ninterim payments and showing the file balance payable or overpaid.\n20. The lease provides that expenses and outgoings incurred by the lessor\nincludes expenditure incurred in the year but also expenditure which is\nof a periodically recurring nature including any sums of by way of\nreasonable provision for anticipated expenditure.\n5\n\n21. The applicant argues that the process resulted in a chargeable amount\nwhich varies and reflects differing expenditure made in each year. The\nRespondent does not follow the lease procedure but adopts collection in\nadvance despite no lease provision for this.\n22. The Applicant says a demand for a single fixed sum is sent to each tenant\neach year before the Respondents financial year end with the amount so\ncharged remaining the same for several years at a time. This does not\nreflect differing expenditure each year. The annual certified account\nsummary is not sent to tenants until after payment for the year has\nalready been demanded. The Applicant asserts this is a fundamental\nbreach of the lease. This means there is no process by which the\nApplicant can determine whether the costs are reasonably incurred for\nworks of a reasonable standard as payment comes before works whereas\nstatute strongly implies that the test of reasonableness requires the cost\nof works to be known before payment. The Applicant asserts he is not\nliable to meet demands for payment where an ad hoc sum is demanded\nfrom tenants before undisclosed work is undertaken.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n23. The tribunal does not accept this interpretation. Clause2(3)(ii)(e)\nprovides that the “expenses and outgoings incurred by the lessor”\nincludes not only expenses and outgoings incurred but also such\nreasonable part of all expenses which are of a periodically recurring\nnature by regular or irregular periods and including a sum or sums of\nmoney by way reasonable provision for anticipated expenditure. Sub\nclause (g) provides for interim payments to be taken into account when\nascertaining the amount of the payment due from leaseholders. Clearly\ntherefore anticipated expenditure is allowable always subject to the\nstatutory test of reasonableness. Both actual and advance service charges\ncan be challenged in the tribunal.\n24. The tribunal finds that the advance application for payment items and\nreserve fund items are payable.\nExpenditure accounts summaries very late\n25. The Applicant argues that the length of time between demands for\npayment and production of certified annual accounts is usually more\nthan one year. As a result of the demand for the next annual payment has\nalready been made long before it relates to a summary of expenditure.\nThe Respondent habitually demands annual service charge payments in\nadvance of any expenditure records.\n26. The Applicant agrees that the Respondents financial year runs from 26\nMarch in one year to 25 March the following year. You would expect the\nsummary of expenditure to be issued in April of each year.\n6\n\n27. Once the summary has been issued, section 22 of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985 (the 1985 Act) allows leaseholders 6 months to give\nnotice to the landlord requiring the landlord to afford reasonable\nfacilities for inspecting accounts receivable or documents relevant to the\nmatters which must be dealt with in a statement of account required to\nbe supplied to him and to provide reasonable facilities for taking copies\nof or extracts from them. The landlord must comply with the notice\nwithin 21 days.\n28. The Respondent has resisted all attempts to allow detailed inspection\nand only supplies a copy of the same certificated summary of expenditure\nfor each section 22 request the applicant asserts he is not liable to meet\ndemands for payment made months before any supporting accounts are\nproduced let alone inspected.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n29. The tribunal does not agree with this interpretation. Section 22 does not\ngive the right to withhold service charge payments.\nInadmissible legal fees\n30. The tribunal previously determined that the Respondent’s company legal\nfees are not recoverable via the service charge\n(LON/00AH/LSC/2009/0083 paragraphs 45 and 49). The Applicant\nalleges that some years ago the respondent sold the tenants a number of\nroof replacements which was subsequently judged to be unfit for purpose\nworthless. The cost was contested in the Croydon County Court where\nthe Respondent lost. The legal fees incurred by the Respondent were\nbelieved to be substantial but have not been disclosed by the Respondent\nbut it seems were added to the service charges. Only full disclosure can\ndetermine the issue.\n31. The Respondent’s corporate accounts for the years 2020, 2021, 2022,\nand 2023 include the statement “the company is presently incurring\nlegal costs as a result of action taken by leaseholder which will involve\ncounty court proceedings. In order to fund the cost of defending this\naction, a cash call on members will be necessary, as the company has\ninsufficient funds to do so”\n32. The Applicant argues that no cash call on shareholders has been made\nwhich points to the legal fees being met from the service charge fund.\nThe Applicant does not recognise the Respondent’s legal fees as payable\nservice charges.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n7\n\n33. The tribunal accepts that in principle the Respondents legal fees are not\nrecoverable in the service charge as there is no lease provision for them\nto be payable.\nReserve fund\n34. The Applicant argues that a reserve fund does not appear to be catered\nfor within the lease nor does the lease contain any agreement that\nadditional sums may be charged for similar purposes. The lease already\ncontains “reasonable provision for anticipated expenditure.” The\nApplicant accepts that surplus service charge payments remaining at the\nend of one year may be held in trust for the next year instead of returning\nthem to tenants. The Applicant asserts that any such surplus is held in\ncredit pro rata for contributing tenants and does not belong to the\nRespondent until it has been spent and accounted for as normal service\ncharge expenditure.\n35. The Applicant does not recognise charges for reserves as payable service\ncharges.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n36. The tribunal is of the view that while the lease could be clearer and does\nnot use the term “reserve fund” it does provide for a reasonable provision\nfor anticipated expenditure.\n37. With any long lease, and particularly one of this length it must be\nexpected that from time to time major repairs will be required. The lease\nallows for reasonable provision to be made, and it should be noted the\nlease provision for “reasonable provision“ ties in with the statutory\nobligation under section 19 of the 1985 Act. The alternative would be that\nexpenditure was be paid for by leaseholders in the year in which it arises\nwhich would no doubt cause financial difficulty to many leaseholders.\n38. The requirement is that any funds collected for anticipated expenditure\nmust be reasonable which in the view of the tribunal includes informing\nleaseholders what expenditure is anticipated but should be justified by,\nfor example, a costed planned maintenance schedule or similar\ndocuments. Any major expenditure will be subject to the section 20\nconsultation process.\nPayments for the Respondent’s business\n39. The Applicant states that there is no lease based agreement for funding\nthe Respondent’s own business activities by the service charge. A letter\nfrom the managing agents informed all tenants that the Respondent\nintended to raise such funds in future by annual cash call on the company\nshareholders but no cash call to place.\n8\n\n40. The Applicant argues that it seems probable from the annual service\ncharge accounts that the Respondent is still ignoring past FTT\ndeterminations and inserting company administration costs into the\nservice charge. The Applicant does not recognise such charges as payable\nservice charges.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n41. The tribunal agrees that there is no provision in the lease for recovering\ncosts solely attributable to the Respondent company which fall outside\nmanaging agents and accountancy costs.\nTransferred to the Respondent’s business\n42. The Applicant argues that it can be seen from the Respondents annual\nservice charge summary and corporate accounts that the Respondent has\ndiverted funds from the service charge to the Respondents company\nbank account for unknown purposes but there is no process agreed\nwithin the lease elsewhere.\n43. The Respondent’s account summary record such transfers as being due\nfrom the limited company or due to the service charge. The total has been\nincreasing each year from £4,121 in 2019 to £17,110 in 2024.\n44. The ground rent income to the Respondent is £950 per annum so it is in\nno position to repay the debt let alone within one year as the company\nbalance sheet states. Service charges have been inflated by the amounts\ntransferred to the Respondent’s business or the services supplied have\nbeen reduced by the same amount.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n45. The tribunal considers that the Applicant is conflating the service charge\nbalance sheet and company balance sheets with the annual service\ncharge. There is no evidence before the tribunal to show that service\ncharges have been inflated or services reduced by these balance sheet\nentries.\nProvision for future service charges\n46. The arguments under this heading largely repeat the point made under\nthe reserve fund heading will not be repeated here.\nFTT settlement\n47. In the county court case referred to above the Applicant states that the\nRespondent was judged to supply tenants with new roofing which was\n9\n\nunfit for purpose and the respondent was ordered to credit the\napplicant’s service charge account with £4,213 in settlement.\n48. The 2021 accounts show that figure as being charged to the service\ncharge fund. The Respondent was the counterparty to the case not the\nTenant’s service charge fund so settlement should come from the\nrespondent company funds instead.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n49. The tribunal accepts that the Applicant is technically correct although as\nthe tribunal has pointed out previously as the shareholders are the\nleaseholders in the block, it is the same the people paying but under a\ndifferent heading.\nInsurance claims\n50. The applicant argues that the service charge summary accounts for 2022\nand 2023 show costs of insurance claims and it is for the Respondent to\ndemonstrate why tenants are being asked to pay for insurance claims\nrather than the insurer. There is no mention of insurance claims being\nservice charges in the lease.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n51. In the absence of any justification tribunal finds that cost of insurance\nclaims are not a payable charge.\n52. The lessor covenants to keep the building insured against specified perils\nand unless the amount payable under any claim is irrecoverable by\nreason of default by the lessee the landlord covenants to apply such\ninsurance money in rebuilding or reinstating the building and to make\nany deficiencies out of the lessor’s own money.\nDisputed service charges for the year before 25 March 2019\nThe tribunal’s decision\n53. The tribunal determines that the amount payable in respect of pre-2019\nservice charges is £3,021.00.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n54. The Applicant argues that pre-2019 service charges are statute barred\nunder the Limitation Act as the claim is more than 6 years old. In its\n2009 decision the tribunal held that the limitation period was 12 years\nand this tribunal agrees with that decision for the reasons given and in\n10\n\nthe absence of a prime facie case to challenge any of those items holds\nthat the charges are payable. As this is an item on the Applicant’s account\nit is payable in full and not subject to a 1/54 apportionment.\nHealth and safety risk assessment\n55. The applicant disputes service charge payments in 2019 £1,962 and in\n2021 of £1,174.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n56. The tribunal determines that these amounts are payable.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n57. The lease places the lessor under an obligation to repair and maintain\nthe building and common parts. In order to comply with that obligation\nthe lessor must also comply with its legal obligations to residents arising\nunder various Acts and regulations.\nAsbestos survey\n58. The Applicant disputes items of £264 in 2019 and £36 in 2020 under\nthis heading.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n59. The tribunal determines that these amounts are payable.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n60. There is a statutory obligation on the owners to maintain an asbestos\nregister to ensure the health and safety of contractors working on site\nand any directly employed staff. As the landlord is under an obligation to\nmaintain the building it must comply with the statutory requirements\nand maintenance of an asbestos register is a cost of repairing the\nbuilding.\nItems not payable\n61. For the reasons given above, or lack of evidence, administration fees,\nother management fees, sundry expenses, FTT settlement, insurance\nclaims, postage and photocopying, legal and statutory fees, document\nstorage, and other professional fees are not payable.\n11\n\nBalance sheet entries\n62. The balance sheet entries are outside the scope of the service charge and\nnot within the tribunal’s jurisdiction.\nOverall outcome\n63. The table below shows the overall outcome of this determination with\nthe Applicant being responsible for paying 1/54th of the payable items.\nApplication under s.20C\n64. In the application form, the Applicant applied for an order under section\n20C of the 1985 Act. Having heard the submissions from the parties and\ntaking into account the determinations above, the tribunal determines\nthat it is just and equitable in the circumstances for an order to be made\nunder section 20C of the 1985 Act, so that the Respondent may not pass\nany of its costs incurred in connection with the proceedings before the\ntribunal through the service charge.\nName: A Harris Date: 24 June 2025\n12\nite m\nP a y a b le ite m s\np re 2 0 1 9\na d v a n c e a p p lic a tio n fo r p a y m e n t\nre s e rv e fu n d (p ro v is io n fo r fu tu re )\nH & S ris k a s s e s s m e n t\na s b e s to s s u rv e y\n1 /5 4 th\nIte m s n o t p a y a b le\na d m in is tra tio n fe e\no th e r m a n a g e m e n t fe e s\ns u n d ry e x p e n s e s\nF T T s e ttle m e n t\nin s u ra n c e c la im s\np o s ta g e a n d p h o to c o p y in g\nle g a l a n d s ta tu to ry fe e s\nd o c u m e n t s to ra g e\no th e r p ro fe s s io n a l fe e s\nIte m s o u ts id e th e s e rv ic e c h a rg e\no w e d b y re s p o n d e n t to s e rv ic e\nc h a rg e fu n d\n£\n£\n£\n3 ,0 2 1 .0\n3 ,0 2 1 .0\n-\n0\n0\n£££££\n£\n£££\n£££\n£\n1 ,7 5\n1 0 ,5 0\n1 ,9 6\n2 6\n1 4 ,4 7\n2 6\n2 2\n2 5\n1\n3\n8 7\n1 ,3 8\n4 ,1 2\n2\n03249\n8\n123\n028\n1\n0 1 9\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.1 3\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n££\n£\n£\n£\n££\n£\n1 ,7 5\n3\n1 ,7 8\n3\n9 1\n1\n3 6\n1 ,2 8\n1 1 ,4 5\n2\n0\n66\n3\n1\n0\n01\n7\n0 2 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 7\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n£\n£\n£\n££££\n££\n£\n1 ,7 5\n1 ,1 7\n2 ,9 2\n5\n4 7\n6 1\n9\n4 ,2 1\n4 9\n5 ,8 9\n1 1 ,1 7\n2\n0\n4\n4\n4\n3393\n20\n4\n0 2 1\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.1 5\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n£\n£\n£\n££\n££\n£\n2\n1 ,7 5 0\n1 ,7 5 0\n3 2\n8\n1 5 ,3 4 9\n3 0\n1 ,8 4 0\n1 7 ,2 2 7\n1 5 ,1 7 5\n0 2 2\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.4 1\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n££\n£\n£\n£\n£\n££\n£\n1 ,7 5\n1 ,0 0\n2 ,7 5\n5\n1 9\n2 ,4 2\n3 ,1 9\n5 ,8 1\n1 6 ,4 0\n2\n00\n0\n0\n7\n2\n54\n2\n0 2 3\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.9 3\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n£\n£\n£\n£\n££\n£\n£\n2 ,7 5\n2 ,7 5\n5\n2\n5\n4 ,5 7\n4 ,6 5\n1 7 ,1 1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n5\n44\n3\n0\n0 2 4\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.9 3\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n.0 0\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n13"

For The Old Forge....................................... £6 300\nb. For White Gables ....................................... £5 050\nBackground\n2. Yet again the tribunal is asked to deal with two of the many leases for a term of\n500 years that were granted in the late Elizabethan period and at the start of the\nreign of King James VI & I. The tribunal’s own researches, which include some\nobservations by the editor of the current (6th) edition of Megarry & Wade, tend\nto support the view that the explanation why so many 500 year leases were\ngranted in this period concerned not so much strict settlements (which developed\nlater) but wardship – an unfortunate element of the feudal tenure by knight\nservice which was used by the Crown to raise extra cash without having to call a\nParliament to argue about his budget.1 The tribunal assumed it was a means by\nwhich the Crown or the ward's \"guardian\" could help himself and despoil the\nvalue of the estate, but Dr Charles Harpum has explained it as a preventive\nmeasure often employed by estates to reduce their land value and thus discourage\nthe king from exercising his rights of wardship where the heir was still a minor\n(which rights could include telling him whom he should marry. Refusal was\npossible, but bold and expensive). The whole thing was ended by Parliament\nduring the Civil War and confirmed, upon its insistence, on the restoration of\nCharles II in 1660.\n3. In the instant cases the properties stand on land let under one or more of three\nleases granted by John Lennard and Sampson Lennard to Richard Webb, for a\n500 year term. No further particulars are known or were supplied on first\nregistration (as long ago as February 1913) other than that the annual rent is one\npeppercorn.\n4. On 31st May 2018 in the County Court at Peterborough, the applicant issued a\nclaim under Part 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 seeking a transfer to her of\nthe freehold of The Old Forge. By an order made by Deputy District Judge Evans\nat a hearing in Cambridge on 19th July 2018 the freehold title in the property was\nvested in the applicant subject to the appropriate sum being paid into court, the\namount to be determined by this tribunal.\n5. So far as White Gables is concerned, on 19th September 2018, in the County Court\nat Peterborough, the applicant issued a similar Part 8 claim. By an order made\n1 See Charles J Reid Jnr : The Seventeenth Century Revolution in the English Land Law (Cleveland\nState University, 1995), at pgs 234–241\n\nby District Judge Bosman at a hearing in Cambridge on 29th October 2018 the\nfreehold title in the property was vested in the applicant subject to the\nappropriate sum being paid into court, the amount to be determined by this\ntribunal.\nApplicable valuation principles\n6. The annual rent under the leases (one peppercorn) has been treated as nominal,\nand the purchase price is determined in accordance with section 9(1) of the\nLeasehold Reform Act 1967, the relevant elements of which may be listed as :\na. The capitalised value of the rent payable from date of service of the notice\nof the tenant’s claim (in the case of a missing landlord, the date that\nproceedings are issued) until the original term date\nb. The capitalised value of the section 15 modern ground rent notionally\npayable from the original term date for a further period of 50 years\nc. The value of the landlord’s reversion to the house and premises after the\nexpiry of the 50-year lease extension.\n7. Although valuers have long operated on the assumption that this third element\nwould be deferred so long as to be almost valueless, and hence they tended to\nignore it and instead carry out only a two-stage valuation, the Upper Tribunal\n(Lands Chamber) determined in the case of Re Clarise Properties Ltd2 that there\nwas now a much greater likelihood that the ultimate reversion would have a\nsignificant value than there was when the two-stage approach was adopted 40\nyears ago, because :\na. House prices had increased substantially in real terms; and\nb. Lower deferment rates had been applied since the decision in Earl\nCadogan v Sportelli.3\nThe practice of conducting a two-stage valuation should therefore cease and the\nfull three-stage calculation, including the Haresign4 addition, be applied.\n8. Section 9(1) requires that the price payable shall be the amount which at the\nrelevant time the house and premises, if sold in the open market by a willing\nseller (with the tenant and members of his family not buying or seeking to buy),\nmight be expected to realise on the assumptions listed in the sub-section.\n9. Interestingly, however, in Re Clarise Properties the President drew attention to\none factor which would have the effect of suppressing the value of the freehold\nreversion. To quote the material passage in full :\n39 When valuing the reversion to a standing house on the expiry of the\n50-year lease extension it is necessary to assume that Schedule 10 to the\nLocal Government and Housing Act 1989 applies to the tenancy.\nAccordingly the tenancy automatically continues until notice is served\nunder para 4 of Schedule 10, when the tenant is entitled to an assured\ntenancy under the Housing Act 1988 at a market rent. Mr Evans made a\ndeduction of £2 500 (or 1.75 per cent) from his standing house valuation\n2 [2012] UKUT 4 (LC); [2012] 1 EGLR 83 (George Bartlett QC (President) & N J Rose FRICS)\n3 [2007] EWCA Civ 1042, [2008] 1 WLR 2142\n4 See Haresign v St John the Baptist’s College, Oxford (1980) 255 EG 711, explained in the current\n(6th) edition of Hague : Leasehold Enfranchisement at para 9–16\n\nof £142 500 to reflect this provision. He accepted that the freehold interest\nin a house is significantly less attractive to a purchaser if it is subject to an\nassured tenancy than if it is vacant. He justified his very modest\ndeduction, however, by emphasising that what is to be assumed is not that\nthe tenant will continue in possession at the end of the 50-year extension,\nbut that the tenant will have the right to remain in possession. It was\nimpossible to know what the view of the tenant would be in 78.5 years'\ntime.\n40 It is true that the purchaser of the freehold reversion would have no\nmeans of knowing whether vacant possession would be gained at the end\nof the 50-year lease extension. In our view, however, the fact that there\ncan be no certainty of obtaining vacant possession would have a\nsignificant depressing effect on value and a substantially greater effect\nthan that suggested by Mr Evans. In the absence of any comparable\nevidence to indicate the scale of the appropriate deduction we conclude\nthat a purchaser would assume that the value of the eventual reversion\nwould be £114 000, equivalent to 80% of the full standing house value of\n£142 500.\n10. The transcript of the judgment does not reveal the evidential basis for concluding\nthat a reduction of 20% (as opposed to any other percentage) was appropriate.\nHowever, in the 6th edition of Hague5 at para 9–17 this is described as\n...controversial, since there was no evidence adduced to support it, and it\nis substantially higher than the traditional 10 per cent which was used to\ncalculate the risk of a statutory tenancy arising under Part 1 of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1954, and the much lower discount to reflect\n1989 Act rights : see paragraph 9–43.\nThis is a very lengthy paragraph, but after referring to the case of Lloyd-Jones v\nChurch Commissioners for England6 the material part reads :\nOn the evidence of that case, the Tribunal held that the landlord’s\nreversion after the original term date should be valued at the vacant\npossession value (less the value of tenant’s improvements) less 10 per cent\ndeduction for the risk of the tenant claiming a tenancy under Part 1 of the\n1954 Act, the resulting figure then being deferred at an appropriate\npercentage (the deferment rate) for the period of the unexpired term of\nthe tenancy.\nThis approach and method has been universally adopted and accepted by\nthe Lands Tribunal and leasehold valuation tribunals in subsequent cases\nboth in relation to Part 1 of the 1954 Act and Schedule 10 to the 1989 Act.\nIn either case, the appropriate deduction to take account of the tenant’s\nright is a matter of valuation evidence. It is not a convention so the fact\nthat a particular discount has been given on one set of facts in one case is\nnot relevant for the purpose of determining what the discount should be\nin another case...\n5 Hague : Leasehold Enfranchisement (6th ed – Sweet & Maxwell, 2014)\n6 [1982] 1 EGLR 209\n\n...Each case will depend on its own facts and evidence and some tribunals\nhave given discounts under the 1993 Act of up to 10 per cent for assured\ntenancy rights.7\n11. Section 27(2)(a) provides that the material valuation date is that on which the\napplication was made to the court. The claim was issued on 2nd January 2017, so\nthat is the material date to be applied. As the unexpired term exceeds 80 years\nno share of any marriage value is payable.8\n12. In most cases where there is a missing landlord, but perhaps surprisingly not in\nall, there will have been no rent paid for a substantial period before the date of\nthe application. Section 27(5) requires that the applicant must pay into court not\nonly the price payable, as determined by the tribunal, but also the amount or\nestimated amount remaining unpaid of any pecuniary rent payable for the house\nand premises up to the date of the conveyance. Section 166 of the Commonhold\nand Leasehold Reform Act 20029 imposes an interesting restriction upon that by\nproviding :\n“A tenant under a long lease of a dwelling is not liable to make a payment\nof rent under the lease unless the landlord has given him a notice relating\nto the payment; and the date on which he is liable to make the payment is\nthat specified in the notice.”\nThe limitation period for recovery of unpaid rent is 6 years, so that is the\nmaximum rent which could ever be recoverable.\nInspection and hearing\n13. The tribunal inspected the two properties at 10:00 on the morning of the hearing.\nAt the time the weather was cold and dry, but the ground was damp.\n14. The Old Forge comprises a pair of Victorian semi-detached cottages connected\ninternally only via a central rear extension. Viewed from the street, the remains\nof the old forge are located in a single storey wooden extension at the right hand\nend, just beyond a covered vehicular passageway secured by garage doors to the\nfront. The building sits next the road, centrally along one edge of a triangular site\nbordered to the rear by a stream, and with rough garden land to either side and\nat the rear. Sitting centrally to the rear are two brick outhouses, one of which is\nseverely distressed due to the presence of a tree growing through or leaning on\nit. Internally, the right hand cottage is extremely dated and requires complete\nmodernisation. It has two largish bedrooms (one over the passageway) reached\nvia a very wide landing at the top of the stairs. This probably doubled as a child’s\nwalk-through bedroom in former times. The cottage to the left appears to have\nbeen renovated in about the 1970s, with a fine polished timber framework all that\nis left of a former lath and plaster wall on the ground floor, a new timber\nstaircase, and built-in wardrobes in the bedrooms – one of which has a cabin bed.\nIt would seem that the rear extension was used as the kitchen for this, lived-in\nend of the building after the acquisition of both semi-detached parts.\n7 See also para 9–35 and the reference to Silvote Ltd v Liverpool City Council [2010] UKUT 192\n(LC), where the tribunal declined to apply a 10 per cent deduction where only 11 years were left\non the lease and there was no evidence to justify it\n8 LRA 1967, s.9(1E)\n9 In force from 28th February 2005\n\n15. Next door, White Gables comprises a modest detached bungalow built perhaps\nin the 1960s or possibly early 1970s, to which a large conservatory extension has\nbeen built at one end and a garage at the other. The garage extends to the eastern\nboundary. The premises sit well back from the road, between a good-sized front\ngarden and a very long rear one. To its west, separated by a hedge, trees and a\nside garden, lies the Old Forge. To its east, beyond a part-completed brick wall,\nlies another modest bungalow of perhaps similar vintage, but with a number of\nwindows facing towards it.\n16. When selling off the properties on either side the then owner of White Gables\nreserved the benefit for her adjoining land of\n...the right at any time to erect or suffer to be erected any buildings or\nother erections and alter any buildings or other erections now standing or\nhereafter to be erected on the transferor’s said adjoining property in such\nmanner as to obstruct or interfere with the passage of light or air to any\nbuilding which is or may be erected on the property.\n17. At the hearing both applicants were represented by Ms Kate Church, solicitor, of\nHewitsons. Expert valuation evidence was provided in each case by Robert C\nSadler FRICS, who had prepared two reports and answered questions from the\ntribunal upon their contents. In each report Mr Sadler sought to rely upon the\nvaluation principles, and in particular the adjustments to the Sportelli rate, that\nwere accepted by previous tribunals in June and October 2014 when determining\nthe sum to be paid into court for :\na. Green Cottage, 58 The Green, Weston Colville,10 and\nb. White Gates, Common Road, Weston Colville.11\n18. When challenged about the values he had attributed to each site value Mr Sadler\nargued that it was unlikely that one could replace the Old Forge with three\nmodern detached buildings, but with substantial modernisation and extension\nof the building that was already there (as two slightly linked houses plus forge)\none could anticipate a standing house value of £750 000.\n19. He also agreed that his value for White Gables may also be light, as that site could\nalso accommodate a more substantial building. The best evidence for that,\nhowever, was the sale that had been agreed for the subject property – until the\ntitle issue came to light– at a price of £375 000. The purchaser is still interested,\nbut at the lower price of £365 000 (even though it is the seller who has incurred\nthe effort and expense of bringing the claim and who will have to pay money into\ncourt). Questioned about his comparables, which are all on smaller sites with no\nsimilar opportunity for extension and/or redevelopment, Mr Sadler argued that\nthis is reflected in values of bungalows without that possibility, at c.£325 000.\nHe agreed that his comparables are on smaller individual plots, and that the\n“tone of the list” for that type of property is between £325 000 and £350 000.\nIf this were a cleared site, it would be back in the £250 000 category for the plot.\nFindings\n20. The Old Forge — The tribunal accepts that there are features, both internally\nwithin the main building and in the former forge extension itself, that could\n10 CAM/12UG/OAF/2013/0003\n11 CAM/12UG/OAF/2014/0006\n\njustify spot-listing, so valuation is best approached on the basis of a standing\nhouse that is ripe for modernisation and extension rather than on a vacant site\nbasis. On the assumption that the site can accommodate only the one large house\nthe tribunal attributes a built value to it of £750 000 and a site value (at 30%) of\n£225 000. The tribunal sees no reason to diverge from the yield and deferment\nrates, each of 6%, for which Mr Hallam had so persuasively argued in the case\nbefore this tribunal in April 2014 of Green Cottage, 58 The Green, Weston\nColville and which decision Mr Sadler now relied upon. Making a deduction of\n10% for Housing Act rights that produces a premium of £6 300 that is payable\ninto court. A detailed explanation appears in Schedule A.\n21. White Gables — While no listing constraints affect this property it does lie close\nto the adjoining bungalow and planners may care to impose some limitations on\nthe precise location, dimensions and layout of any modern house built to replace\nthe current bungalow (regardless of the rights reserved in the conveyances of\nboth adjoining properties). Taking account of the values of comparables which\nenjoy no potential for redevelopment and enlargement, the tribunal considers\nthat the most substantial house that might be achieved on this plot is likely to be\nless valuable than development next door, at The Old Forge. It attributes a value\nto any such property of £600 000, resulting in a bare site value of £180 000, at\nthe same 30% proportion as above. Applying the same yield and deferment rates,\nand the 10% deduction under Schedule 10, produces a premium of £5 050 that\nthe applicant must pay into court.

On 5 July 2018, Ms Struppe appealed against an Improvement Notice\nissued by Eastbourne Borough Council (“the Council”) under Sections 11\n& 12 of the Housing Act 2004 (“the Act”) and dated 25 June 2018.\n2. The Improvement Notice concerns a property at 1 Croxden Way,\nWillingdon BN22 0HU. The freehold owner is the appellant, Ms D\nStruppe, who lives in Malta. She was represented by her sister, Mrs\nCottell, who is familiar with the property and prepared the appeal on Ms\nStruppe’s behalf.\n3. The property is occupied by Ms Amy Woodward, a lone parent with two\nyoung children, on an assured shorthold tenancy.\n4. The Council considered that an Improvement Notice was appropriate\nbecause substantial works were needed to reduce the risks presented by\nvarious category 1 and category 2 hazards.\n5. In summary, the category 1 hazard was: excess cold. The category 2\nhazards were: falls on stairs, damp & mould, electrical hazards and falls\non levels.\n6. The remedial actions required were:\n• Excess cold: renew/repair radiator in dining room, provide\nadditional radiators or an appropriate form of heating with\nthermostat controls to the bathroom, toilet and downstairs\nhallway, to ensure the property can be adequately heated and\nremove cold spots where condensation can form creating black\nmould.\n• Falls on stairs: take up and re-fit the stair carpet so that it is\nsecurely fixed down and not loose and ensure the spikes from the\ngripper rods cannot be felt through the carpet.\n• Damp & mould: renew the gutter joint to the rear of the property\nand ensure water discharges into proper drainage.\n• Electrical hazards: provide a copy of the Electrical Installation\nCondition Report, repair/replace the outside light to the rear of\nthe property, and make good all damaged and defective electrical\nsockets.\n• Falls on levels: remove all frayed carpets to the dining room and\nliving room, provide a suitable floor covering fitted to\nmanufacturer’s instructions.\n2\n\n7. Ms Struppe’s relevant grounds of appeal, in summary, were: (1)\ninsufficient category 1 & 2 hazards existed in the property to justify the\nissue of the Improvement Notice; (2) she disagreed with some of the\ncategory 1 & 2 hazards and the required remedial actions.\n8. Directions were issued by the tribunal on 11 July and 14 September 2018.\nIn the latter Directions, Judge Tildesley OBE admitted the appeal as\nvalid following an objection by the Council. Both parties complied with\nDirections for certain further steps to be taken to prepare for the hearing.\nThe Law (insofar as is relevant to the appeal)\nHousing Act 2004\nSection 1 New System for assessing housing conditions and\nenforcing housing standards\n(1) This Part provides —\n(a) for a new system of assessing the condition of residential premises, and\n(b) for that system to be used in the enforcement of housing standards in\nrelation to such premises.\n(2) The new system –\n(a) operates by reference to the existence of category 1 or category 2 hazards\non residential premises (see Section 2), and\n(b) replaces the existing system based on the test of fitness for human\nhabitation contained in section 604 of the Housing Act 1985 (c 68).\nSection 2 Meaning of “category 1 hazard” and “category 2 hazard”\n(1) In this Act –\n“category 1 hazard” means a hazard of a prescribed description which falls within\na prescribed band as a result of achieving, under a prescribed method for\ncalculating the seriousness of hazards of that description, a numerical score of or\nabove a prescribed amount;\n“category 2 hazard” means a hazard of a prescribed description which falls within\na prescribed band as a result of achieving, under a prescribed method for\ncalculating the seriousness of hazards of that description, a numerical score below\nthe minimum amount prescribed for a category 1 hazard of that description; and\n“hazard” means any risk of harm to the health or safety of an actual or potential\noccupier of a dwelling or HMO which arises from a deficiency in the dwelling or\nHMO or in any building or land in the vicinity (whether the deficiency arises as a\n3\n\nresult of the construction of any building, an absence of maintenance or repair, or\notherwise).\n(2) In subsection (1)—\n“prescribed” means prescribed by regulations made by the appropriate national\nauthority (see section 261(1)); and\n“prescribed band” means a band so prescribed for a category 1 hazard or a category\n2 hazard, as the case may be.\n(3) Regulations under this section may, in particular, prescribe a method for\ncalculating the seriousness of hazards which takes into account both the\nlikelihood of the harm occurring and the severity of the harm if it were to\noccur.\n(4) In this section—\n“building” includes part of a building;\n“harm” includes temporary harm.\n(5)In this Act “health” includes mental health.\nSection 11 Improvement notices relating to category 1 hazards: duty\nof local authority to make order\n(1) If—\n(a) the local housing authority are satisfied that a category 1 hazard exists on\nany residential premises, and\n(b) no management order is in force in relation to the premises under Chapter\n1 or 2 of Part 4,\nServing an improvement notice under this section is a course of action\navailable to the authority in relation to the hazard for the purposes of section 5\n(category 1 hazards general duty to take enforcement action).\n(2) An improvement notice under this section is a notice requiring the person\non whom it is served to take such remedial action in respect of the hazard\nconcerned as is specified in the notice in accordance with subsections (3) to\n(5) and section 13.\n….. (3) to (8)\nSection 12 Improvement notice relating to category 2 hazards\n4\n\n(1) If –\n(a) the local authority are satisfied that a category 2 hazard exists on any\nresidential premises, and\n(b) no management order is in force in relation to the premises under\nChapter 1 or 2 of Part 4,\nthe authority may serve an improvement notice under this section in\nrespect of the hazard.\n(2) An improvement notice under this section is a notice requiring the\nperson on whom it is served to take such remedial action in respect of\nthe hazard concerned as is specified in the notice in accordance with\nsubsections (3) and section 15.\n….. (3) to (6)\nInspection\n9. The members of the tribunal inspected the property before the hearing,\naccompanied by Ms Struppe’s representative Mrs Cottell and her\nhusband, Ms D Kidson, Specialist Advisor (Private Housing), the tenant\nMs Woodward, and two of her friends.\n10. The property is a modern end of terrace two storey house with two good\nsize bedrooms, bathroom and separate WC upstairs and a lounge and\nkitchen/dining room downstairs. The tribunal’s attention was drawn to\na power point in one bedroom where a small amount of plaster had\ndisintegrated immediately below the power point, the lack of heating\nprovision in the entrance hallway, bathroom and separate WC, damp\nand mould marking to the bathroom ceiling, a slightly stretched carpet\nwith noticeable spikes from the gripper rods on the stairs, rippled carpet\non the half landing, frayed carpet edges to the lounge and dining room,\na non-working radiator in the dining room, a buzzing light fitting in the\nentrance hall, two power points in the living room with a mastic or\nsimilar treatment around them, and visibly dripping guttering outside at\nthe back of the property.\nThe hearing\n11. A hearing took place at Bexhill Town Hall on 8 November 2018. Ms\nStruppe did not attend in person. She was represented by Mrs Cottell,\nwho was accompanied by her husband. Ms M Wilkinson, solicitor,\nrepresented the Council. Also in attendance were Ms D Kidson,\nSpecialist Advisor (Private Housing) and Ms R Wynn, Private Housing\nManager.\n5\n\nBackground facts\n12. Ms Struppe is the freehold owner the property. In or around March 2017,\nMs Woodward moved in under an assured shorthold tenancy. The\ntribunal did not have a copy of the tenancy agreement.\n13. At that time, the property was managed on behalf of Ms Struppe by\nStevens and Carter, who prepared an Inventory and Schedule of\nCondition dated 3 March 2017, presumably before Ms Woodward moved\nin. Insofar as is relevant to this appeal, the Inventory noted that the\ndining room carpet was frayed at the edge, the stairs/landing carpet was\nrippled, and the lounge carpet was in good condition. The Inventory\ndisclaimers stated that none of the electrical or gas appliances had been\nchecked as to working order. The radiators and power points were listed\nas in situ but they were not tested.\n14. According to a letter from BHT Eastbourne Advice, which was accepted\nby the tribunal as likely to be accurate as to the history, Ms Woodward\nfirst sought advice about various disrepair issues in April 2017. She had\nbeen told after she moved in that the property would be sold. BHT wrote\nto Ms Struppe in March 2018 about the disrepair and other matters\nrelating to the tenancy. Several Notices under S13 Housing Act 1988\nwere served seeking to increase the rent, the outcome of which is\nunknown.\n15. A S21 Notice (Notice Seeking Possession for an AST) was served on 22\nAugust 2017 which expired before possession proceedings were issued.\nA further S21 Notice was served on 3 June 2018 with an end date of 3\nAugust 2018. Meanwhile, the Improvement Notice had been issued, so\nthe NSP was rendered invalid under the Deregulation Act 2015.\n16. BHT further stated that on 28 November 2017 the new managing agents,\nOakfield Property Ltd, emailed Ms Woodward stating that Ms Struppe\ndid not wish to carry out any further works to the property at that time.\nSubsequently the heating system broke down on 28 December 2017 and\nwas fixed on 5 January 2018.\n17. According to the witness statement of Ms Kidson, dated 10 October\n2018, on 2 January 2018 the Council received a complaint from Ms\nWoodward. At that time the boiler was not working. Ms Kidson\ncontacted Oakfield, who confirmed they acted for Ms Struppe, but\nwithout her permission they were unable to carry out works.\n18. Following contact with Oakfield and Ms Struppe, on 1 February 2018 Ms\nKidson served Notice of Intention to inspect the property in respect of\nMs Woodward’ ongoing concerns following the boiler repair. The\ninspection took place on 8 February 2018, when Ms Kidson carried out\na full Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) assessment.\n6\n\n19. Ms Kidson sent her report and remedial action required to Ms Struppe\nby email on 21 February 2018 with a two-month deadline to complete\nthe works on an informal basis, and a warning that failure to do so would\nresult in formal action being taken with a charge attached. Oakfield were\ncopied in.\n20. By April 2018, some repairs had been carried out to the windows and to\nthe electrical sockets, though some associated plaster damage had not\nbeen made good around the sockets. On 6 May 2018 Oakfield confirmed\nthey were no longer acting as managing agents for Ms Struppe.\n21. Ms Kidson re-inspected the property on 16 May 2018 and found that in\nher opinion the category 1 and category 2 hazards still existed. The two-\nmonth deadline for the required works to be carried out had expired. Ms\nKidson informed Ms Struppe of this by email on 23 May 2018 but\nreceived no reply. As a result, the Improvement Notice was prepared and\nserved on 25 June 2018. Ms Struppe objected by email on 27 June 2018\nthat the Improvement Notice was unlawful, and subsequently the appeal\nwas made to the tribunal.\nMs Struppe’s Case\n22. The appeal, prepared by Mrs Cottell, contained 18 numbered points.\nOnly items 7 to 12 related directly to the Improvement Notice. The others\nrelated largely to the landlord and tenant relationship between Ms\nStruppe and Ms Woodward.\n23. For example, Ms Cottell sought to argue that as the result of the\nImprovement Notice, the Deregulation Act 2015 meant that the S21\nNotice was of no effect, which had adversely affected both Ms Struppe’s\nability to evict Ms Woodward and her prospects of selling the property.\nIn addition, the Council had acted unlawfully in inspecting the property,\nwas biased against Ms Struppe, and along with other third parties\n(including BHT and the local MP) had given unlawful and misleading\nadvice to Ms Woodward. Mrs Cottell further contended that Ms\nWoodward was in rent arrears and had damaged the property.\n24. At the start of the hearing, the tribunal explained to Mrs Cottell that it\nhad no jurisdiction over these issues. The tribunal could only consider\nthe grounds of appeal and objections to the Improvement Notice. Under\nparagraph 15(3) of Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Housing Act 2004, the\npower of the tribunal was limited to deciding whether to confirm, quash,\nor vary the Improvement Notice.\n25. Regarding the Improvement Notice, Mrs Cottell submitted that the\nHousing Health & Safety Hazard Ratings (HHSRS) risk assessments had\nnot been adequately justified or explained. She argued that Health and\nSafety legislation should apply to the case so that the Council’s\nrequirements were not “reasonably practicable”.\n7\n\n26. In relation to excess cold, Mrs Cottell submitted that the heating system\nwas in working order and that there was a radiator on the landing by the\nbathroom which should be sufficient for the bathroom. She alleged that\nthe toilet was too small to fit a radiator. Previous tenants had not\ncomplained of cold. Radiator valve caps had been removed (by\nimplication by the tenant). The HHSRS criteria applied to occupants\naged 65 and were therefore not applicable.\n27. In relation to falls on stairs, Mrs Cottell did not agree that the ripple on\nthe landing stair carpet amounted to a hazard and said that all flooring\nand carpets had been replaced in 2015/16.\n28. Turning to electrical hazards, Ms Cottell argued that these did not exist.\nThe outside light and interior sockets had been repaired in May 2018 and\nthere was no missing plasterwork around any sockets. Ms Struppe had\nincurred costs of £474 for an electrical report which turned out not to be\nnecessary.\n29. In relation to mould and damp, Mrs Cottell submitted that repairs had\nbeen carried out to the guttering in December 2015 and that there was\nno evidence of damp or water being discharged onto the property.\n30. In relation to falls on levels, Mrs Cottell submitted that the fraying\ncarpets in the lounge and dining area were due to the tenant cutting\nthem, and it was the tenant’s responsibility to replace the damaged\ncarpets under the terms of the tenancy agreement.\n31. In reply to questions from the tribunal, Mrs Cottell admitted that no\naction had been taken by Ms Struppe in respect of remedial action under\nthe Improvement Notice other than to the electrical hazards. She could\nnot commit Ms Struppe in connection to repairs to the dripping gutter.\nIn general Mrs Cottell took the view that the tenant was responsible for\nremedying any problems that were not the landlord’s fault.\nThe Council’s Case\n32. With reference to the category 1 and 2 hazards, Ms Wilkinson submitted\nthat the correct procedures had been followed, that Ms Kidson’s\nassessment of the relevant hazards under the relevant legislation and\nguidance was correct. The inspection was lawful as proper notice had\nbeen given. She confirmed that Ms Kidson was fully qualified and trained\nto carry out HHSRS assessments and prepare Improvement Notices.\nHealth and Safety legislation was irrelevant to the Improvement Notice\nwhich was governed solely by the Housing Act 2004.\n33. Further, under S11 & 12 of the Act, the existence of category 1 hazards\nand category 2 hazards meant that the Council had a general duty and\npower to take enforcement action, and the issuing of the Improvement\nNotice was a course of action properly open to it.\n8\n\n34. In relation to excess cold, Ms Wilkinson explained that the assessment\nof hazards under HHSRS was based on the risk to any potential occupant\nwho is most vulnerable to the hazard, which would be elderly people. The\nfact that the current occupier Ms Woodward and her children were under\n65 was irrelevant.\n35. Ms Wilkinson rejected any suggestion that Ms Kidson or any Council was\nin any way biased against Ms Struppe. The Council had acted properly in\nresponse to complaints from the tenant.\n36. The Council did not accept that the required remedial actions had been\ncarried out, apart from making good the damaged electrical sockets. The\nrequirement for a full Electrical Installation Condition Report had been\nrelaxed and Ms Struppe had been informed that a minor works electrical\ncertificate would suffice but this had not been provided.\nConsideration\n37. The issue to be determined by the tribunal was whether the\nImprovement Notice should be confirmed, quashed or varied.\n38. In the tribunal’s view, in all the circumstances and on the balance of\nprobabilities, the hazards identified in the Improvement Notice existed\nat the date of issue of the Notice, had been reasonably assessed in\naccordance with the statutory procedure and required methodology. In\naddition, the remedial actions were appropriate and proportionate.\n39. By the date of the hearing, the tribunal found that the electrical hazards\nhad largely been rectified, which suggested that these had been accepted\nby Ms Struppe, but the other hazards and remedial actions remained\noutstanding and these were observed by the tribunal at the inspection.\n40. Mrs Cottell had produced various contractor’s invoices which she argued\ndemonstrated that either the relevant hazard did not exist or had been\nremedied in relation to the guttering and lounge radiator.\n41. However, the tribunal noted that an invoice from BGW for works to clear\nand repair the rear guttering was dated 7 December 2017, some six\nmonths before the date of the Improvement Notice. The invoice did not\nspecify which part of the guttering had been repaired, but it was beyond\ndoubt that the central joint was defective as it was seen to be dripping at\nthe time of the inspection. Work to the lounge radiator had been carried\nout in December 2016 but this radiator was not mentioned in the\nImprovement Notice. It was the dining room radiator that was not\nworking and required repair or replacement.\n42. It appeared to the tribunal that Mrs Cottell’s objections to the\nImprovement Notice stemmed mainly from her belief that the assessed\nhazards were either insignificant, or due to defaults or actions by the\ntenant Ms Woodward, and that therefore it was not Ms Struppe’s\nresponsibility to carry out the remedial actions.\n9\n\n43. However, this is to confuse the landlord and tenant relationship with the\nstatutory HHSRS scheme, under which Ms Struppe, as the freehold\nowner and landlord, is the responsible person.\n44. The tribunal makes no comment on Ms Struppe’s obligations to repair\nunder the tenancy agreement or S.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985, and it makes no findings on any alleged actions or defaults by Ms\nWoodward. It was, however, clear from the Stevens and Carter inventory\nthat the frayed dining room carpet and rippled stair carpet existed before\nMs Woodward took up occupation.\n45. For all the above reasons the tribunal confirmed the Improvement\nNotice and refused the appeal.\nJudge JA Talbot\nDated 4 December 2018\nRights of Appeal\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making a written application\nto the First-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing\nwith the case.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal office within 28 days after\nthe Tribunal sends to the person making the application the written\nreasons for the decision.\n3. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28 day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to\nappeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit. The Tribunal will then decide\nwhether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to\nappeal to proceed.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state the\nresult the person making the application is seeking.\n10\n\n11"

The applicants’ representatives were unable to locate Paul Richards\n4. In accordance with the vesting order the application was submitted to\nthe First-tier Tribunal, Property Chamber and directions were issued on\n28th November 2022. These provided that the case would proceed to a\npaper determination. The applicants have not objected to this or\nrequested an oral hearing.\n5. The paper determination took place on 25th January 2023.\n6. In accordance with the directions, the applicants’ solicitors supplied the\nTribunal with a well prepared and helpful bundle that contained copies\nof relevant documents from the County Court proceedings, various title\ndocuments, the existing and proposed lease and an Expert Witness\nvaluation report prepared by Mr Mike Stapleton FRICS dated 9th\nJanuary 2023.\n7. The relevant legal provisions are set out in the appendix to this\ndecision.\nThe background\n8. The leasehold interest in the two flats is registered in names of each\napplicant by virtue of a transfer for the ground and first floor flat made\non 10th June 2004 under Title No NGL503229 and the 28th February\n2007 Title No EGL299167. The freehold of the building has been\nregistered in the name of the respondent under title number MX235519\nsince the 21st March 1990.\n9. The properties are ground and first floor converted flat which form part\nof a Victorian terrace property located in an established residential area\nconverted to form two self contained flats approached via a communal\nhallway. The ground floor flat has one bedroom (50m2) the first floor\nflat has two bedrooms (53m2) It is assumed the flats have not been\nsubject to any significant internal alterations.\n10. The issues\n11. The Tribunal is required to determine the premium to be paid for the\nextended lease in accordance with the 1993 Act and the appropriate\nsum to be paid into Court pursuant to section 27(1)-(7) of the Act.\n12. The Tribunal is required to consider the proposed terms of the lease .\n3\n\n13. The Tribunal did not consider that an inspection of the flats was\nnecessary under current circumstances, nor would it have been\nproportionate to the issues in dispute.\n14. Having studied the various documents in the applicant’s bundle, the\nTribunal has made the determination set out below.\nThe sum to be paid into court\n15. We determine that the premium payable under the 1993 Act is\n£90,850 (Flat A £46,500 Flat B £44,350 ) (Ninety thousand eight\nhundred and fifty pounds and this is the appropriate sum to be paid\ninto Court under section 27(1). Our reasons are set out as follows.\n16. In his report, Mr Stapleton valued the premium at the above sum. This\nwas based on extended lease values £347,002 (flat A) and\n£368,625(flat B), a capitalisation rate of 6%, and a deferment rate of\n5%. Mr Stapleton used the 26th April 2022 as the valuation date, being\nthe date of the Claim form Each of these matters are agreed by the\nTribunal.\n17. At that date, each lease had a unexpired term of 60.91 years and 63.91\nyears.\n18. In view of the fact, each lease has an unexpired term less than 80 years\nmarriage value is deemed to exist. In his report Mr Stapleton uses the\ngraphs and the “Zucconi” case forms the basis for determining relativity\nwhich has been calculated at 78.91 and 80.9 respectively. The Tribunal,\nis of the opinion this is now an incorrect basis to calculate relativity.\nFollowing the case “Deritend Investments (Birkdale) Limited v Ms\nKornelia Treskonva the more recent approach to calculate the issue of\nrelativity is to use the average of the Savills and Gerald Eve 2016\nunenfranchiseable graphs which indicate relativities of 78.98% and\n80.96. Although the valuers approach is incorrect, the differences are\nminimal and do not have a significant affect on the two valuations.\n19. The Tribunal examined the six comparables provided in the report,\neach of which were conversion of Victorian properties to form flats.\nFive of the comparables had two bedrooms and the one remaining\ncomparable, 52 Salisbury Road was a one bedroom ground floor flat.\nThe comparbales were subject to indexation for any time lapse in\ncomparison with the valuation date. It would good practice on behalf of\nthe Valuer to to prepare a schedule which makes valuation adjustments\nin order to provide a precise methodology. Such adjustments would\ntake into account location, internal specification, onsite parking,\nprivate garden. No such schedule was provided by Mr Stapleton,\nhowever, despite these minor misgivings, based upon the comparable\n4\n\nevidence the Tribunal agrees with the two long lease valuations of\n£347,002 and £368,625.\n20. There was no evidence of any ground rent or service charge arrears for\nthe Flats. In the absence of such evidence, the Tribunal determines\nthat no additional sums are payable under the 1993 Act. It follows that\nthe appropriate sum to be paid into Court is £90,850 less £2118.32\n21. Having carefully scrutinised the valuation report, including the\ncomparable evidence, the Tribunal agrees the capitalisation rate.\nTerms of the Transfer\n22. We have considered the Transfer of the whole registered title\nincorporating the TR1. We are satisfied that the terms should be\napproved as drafted.\nName: Mr Duncan Jagger Date: 25th January 2023\n5\n\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) then a written application for permission must be made to\nthe First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing\nwith the case.\n2. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the Regional\noffice within 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the\ndecision to the person making the application.\n3. If the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\nfor permission to appeal to proceed despite not being within the time\nlimit.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the\ncase number), state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\n6\n\nAppendix of relevant legislation\nAppendix of relevant legislation\nLeasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (as\namended)\nSection 50 (1)-(3)\n• (1) Where –\n(a) a qualifying tenant of a flat desires to make a claim to exercise the right to\nacquire a new lease of his flat, but\n(b)the landlord cannot be found or his identity cannot be ascertained\nthe court may, on the application of the tenant, make a vesting order under\nthis subsection.\n• (2) Where –\n(a) a qualifying tenant of a flat desires to make such a claim as is mentioned in\nsubsection (1), and\n(b) paragraph (b) of that subsection does not apply, but\n(c) a copy of a notice of that claim cannot be given in accordance with Part 1 of\nSchedule II to any person to whom it would otherwise be required to be so\ngiven because that person\ncannot be found or his identity cannot be ascertained,\nthe court may on an application of the tenant, make an order dispensing with\nthe need to give a copy of such a notice that that person.\n(3)The court shall not make an order on any application under subsection (1) or (2)\nunless it is satisfied –\n(a) that on the date of the making of the application the tenant had the right to\nacquire a new lease of his flat;

The Applicant seeks a determination pursuant to s.27A of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) and Schedule 11 to the\nCommonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”) as to the\namount of service charges and administration charges payable by the\nApplicant in respect of the service charge years 2016-2024.\nThe hearing\n2. The hearing took place on 18 August 2025. The Applicant, Mr Sharpe,\nappeared in person at the hearing and the Respondent was represented\nby Mr Jackson of counsel.\nThe background\n3. The property which is the subject of this application is a second floor two-\nbedroom purpose built flat.\n4. Neither party requested an inspection and the Tribunal did not consider\nthat one was necessary, nor would it have been proportionate to the\nissues in dispute.\n5. The Applicant holds a long lease of the property which requires the\nlandlord to provide services and the tenant to contribute towards their\ncosts by way of a variable service charge. The specific provisions of the\nlease and will be referred to below, where appropriate.\nThe issues\n6. At the start of the hearing, the Tribunal asked the parties to identify any\ndocuments upon which they sought to rely which were not in the main\nbundle.\n7. Mr Sharpe was concerned that the Respondent had filed a late\naddendum bundle on 11 August 2025 which included numerous\nadditional documents including the Respondent’s skeleton argument\nand the third witness statement of Mr Turton, for which there was no\npermission.\n8. Mr Jackson submitted that the Respondent had recently changed\ncounsel and that he had taken the precautionary approach of providing\ndocumentary evidence in relation to earlier issues raised by the\nApplicant, but which were outside the scope of the specific items of\nchallenge defined by Judge Korn on 06 May 2025. He submitted that if\nthe Tribunal was limiting the issues to those defined by Judge Korn, he\n3\n\ndid not need to rely on the supplementary bundle or the third witness\nstatement of Mr Turton.\n9. The Tribunal confirmed that it intended to consider only the specific\nitems of challenge set out at recital 6 of the Order of Judge Korn; the\nparties both agreed with this approach. Accordingly, the Tribunal\ndid not need to deal with any application to admit late evidence\nand the supplementary bundle and the third witness\nstatement of Mr Turton were excluded by consent.\n10. The Tribunal noted its concern that it had been sent two bundles\namounting to 1,893 pages, much of which was unnecessary. The Tribunal\nqueried the inclusion of the first and second versions of Scott Schedules\n(running to 378 pages) and Mr Jackson conceded that these early\nschedules were not relevant.\n11. The Tribunal asked Mr Sharpe if he had been able to consider Mr\nJackson’s skeleton argument dated 11 August 2025. The Applicant said\nthat he had looked through it but not read it in detail. The Tribunal\nallowed some time for Mr Sharpe to read the skeleton argument.\n12. Mr Jackson confirmed that he was not pursuing the argument set out in\nparagraph 19 of his skeleton argument re debarring and laches. He\nfurther confirmed that he did not intend to cross-examine Mr Sharpe.\nMr Sharpe said he might want to cross-examine Mr Turton but would\nlike to consider this on an issue-by-issue basis. Mr Jackson agreed with\nthis approach, as did the tribunal.\n13. Following a short adjournment, the parties identified the relevant issues\nfor determination as follows (taken from recital 6 of the order of Judge\nKorn and numbered 1-12 by the Tribunal in consultation with the parties\nat the start of the hearing), the years of challenge being 2015/16 to\n2024/25 inclusive, with any challenge in respect of 2024/25 being to the\nestimated charges in that year:\n1) Those sums demanded by way of demands which, according to the\nApplicant, were not in the correct format; [NOTE: the Applicant to\nspecify which demands and what he considers is wrong with them];\n2) Lift maintenance costs in each year, the Applicant’s basis of challenge\nbeing that they are not recoverable under the terms of his lease;\n3) Building insurance premiums in each year, on the basis that the\ninsurance policy appears not to cover the garages and that the\nApplicant believes the premiums to be too high just for the flats;\n4) Entryphone charges in each year, on the basis that the annual charge\nis too high for maintenance; [NOTE: if as was suggested at the CMH\n4\n\nthe charge is for rental costs, the Applicant reserves the right to\nchallenge the reasonableness of the rental costs];\n5) The ‘brought forward’ amount of £900 (or thereabouts) in respect of\n(probably) the 2021/22 service charge year; [NOTE: there was\ninsufficient time to check the exact details at the CMH];\n6) Any penalty charges levied as a consequence of the Applicant failing\nto pay the ‘brought forward’ amount referred to immediately above;\n7) The administrative fees listed on pages 45 and 46 of the CMH hearing\nbundle (being two sums of £210, one of £72 and one of £60);\n8) ‘Rubbish and car park’ charges in each year, the Applicant arguing\nthat these issues should be dealt with by the local authority at no extra\ncost to Council Tax payers;\n9) Accountancy fees for the years from and including 2022/23, on the\nbasis that they rose sharply in 2022/23 and then were kept at a\nsimilar level thereafter;\n10) Management fees in each year, the Applicant stating that the\nmanagement has been sub-standard and/or that specific\nmanagement responsibilities have not been fulfilled;\n11) Garden maintenance charges for 2015/16 and 2016/17 and all other\nyears where those charges have been high, the Applicant to clarify\nwhich other years if any he is challenging and why he considers the\ncharges to be too high; and\n12) Company secretarial charges for those years where the Applicant\nconsiders them to be too high, the Applicant to clarify which years he\nis challenging and why he considers the charges to be too high.\n14. Having heard evidence and submissions from the parties and considered\nthe documents referred to by the parties, the Tribunal has made\ndeterminations on the various issues as follows.\n(Item 1) Those sums demanded by way of demands which,\naccording to the Applicant, were not in the correct format\n15. Judge Korn’s order required the Applicant to specify which demands he\nwas referring to and what he considered was wrong with them. At the\nhearing, Mr Sharpe accepted that he had not specified which demands\nhe was referring to. He accepted he had received the demands now and\nwas no longer pursuing an argument that they were not in the correct\nformat. The Tribunal did not therefore need to determine issue\n1) as this was withdrawn by the Applicant.\n5\n\n(Item 2) The payability of lift maintenance costs in each year, the\nApplicant’s basis of challenge being that they are not recoverable\nunder the terms of his lease\n16. Mr Sharpe explained that the lift was in the communal part of the\nbuilding, it was small, could carry only 2 people and was seldom used.\nHe confirmed that the Property (Flat 17) was on the third floor and that\nthe lift served all floors. In the alternative there were stairs to access the\nProperty.\n17. Mr Sharpe submitted that service charges with respect to the lift were\nnot included within the terms of the Lease. He did not refer the Tribunal\nto any part of the Lease or any legal authority for this contention.\n18. Mr Jackson submitted that the lift was covered by the terms of the Lease\nand referred the Tribunal to the following clauses:\n3 (A) (a) The Lessee hereby covenants with the Lessor that he will pay\nto the Lessor within fourteen days of demand being made an annual\nservice charge at such intervals and in such instalments as the Lessor\nmay from time to time determine being one equal twentieth (1/20th)\nshare of the costs and expenses (determined pursuant to paragraph (B)\nof this Clause)expected to be incurred by the Lessor in the ensuing year\nof and incidental to:-\n(i) the performance and observance of its obligations contained in the\nFourth Schedule hereto [497]\nTHE FOURTH SCHEDULE above referred to\nCovenants by the Lessor\n1. That the Lessor will keep the premises properly supported and\nprotected by the Main Structures\n2. That the Lessor will keep the Main Structures properly repaired\nsupported maintained and reconstructed [510]\nTHE SECOND SCHEDULE above referred to\nThe Main Structures\nThe whole of the Buildings including the main walls foundations and\nroofs thereof and all appurtenances thereof comprising flats erected\nupon the Estate and the internal structural walls/the concrete raft\nseparating the flats horizontally and the other common parts thereof\nbut excluding therefrom those parts of the interior which consist of\n6\n\nseparate flats such flats being taken to include (i) the tiling and\nfloorboards or other surfaces and joists on the floors (ii) the glass in the\nwindows (iii) the window frames (iv) all doors and door frames (v) the\nplaster on the ceiling and walls and (vi) the pipes wires and drains\nsolely serving each individual flat [508]\n19. Mr Jackson argued that the lift fell within the definition of\n“appurtenances”; he did not have any legal authority to support his\nargument.\n20. Mr Sharpe agreed that if the lift was included within the service charge\nprovisions in the Lease it was payable, as was the insurance in respect of\nthe lift.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n21. The Tribunal determines that service charges for lift are payable under\nthe terms of the Lease.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n22. Guidance on the interpretation of leases was given by the Supreme Court\nin Arnold v Britton [2015] UKSC 36; [2015] 2 WLR 1593. In particular,\nthe Tribunal should consider the intention of the parties when drawing\nup the Lease, the overall purpose of clause 3 and the Second and Fourth\nschedules and commercial common sense (per Lord Neuberger in\nparagraph 15 of that decision). Interpreting a provision involves\nidentifying what the parties meant through the eyes of a reasonable\nreader and, save perhaps in a very unusual case, that meaning is most\nobviously to be gleaned from the language of the provisions.\n23. Neither party brought any authority for the proposition that the lift was\nor was not included in the term “appurtenances” referred to under “The\nmain structures” in the Second Schedule. The natural meaning of\n“appurtenance” in the context of property is a less significant but\nnevertheless inherent part of the building which passes when the title is\ntransferred (Collins English Dictionary, Third Edition, p74). Given that\nthe lift is physically attached to and is an inherent part of the common\nparts of the building, serving all floors, the Tribunal finds that the\nreasonable reader would consider the lift to fall within “appurtenances”\nunder the “main structures” of the buildings in Second Schedule of the\nLease. For such a key part of the building not to be included, it would\nhave needed to be expressly excluded in the same way that the separate\nflats are excluded.\n24. It follows that lift maintenance falls within the lessor’s maintenance and\nrepair covenants in Fourth Schedule and under the lessee’s service\n7\n\ncharge covenant at Clause 3. Accordingly, the service charges for lift\nmaintenance are payable under the terms of the Lease.\n(Item 3) Service charge item & amount claimed for building\ninsurance premiums in each year, on the basis that the insurance\npolicy appears not to cover the garages and that the Applicant\nbelieves the premiums to be too high just for the flats\n25. Mr Sharpe submitted that the “insurance policy” appeared not to cover\nthe garages as it just referred to “Flats 1-20” and that it was too high for\njust the flats. He referred to the insurance document from the insurance\nbroker St Giles date stamped 22 September 2016 with insurance cover\nfrom AXA insurance [671]. He said he had not seen each year’s insurance\ndocument and he had not seen all the invoices for insurance but that the\ncover document did not refer to specifically to the garages.\n26. The parties agreed that the building insurance premiums are as follows:\n- 2015: £3,089.00\n- 2016: £4,055.80\n- 2017: £4,772.58\n- 2018: £5,632.58\n- 2019: £6,838.00\n- 2020: £7,386.05\n- 2021: £6,756.92\n- 2022: £8,449.22\n- 2023: £8,245.00\n- 2024: £8,485.00\n27. Mr Sharpe did not have any alternative insurance quotes and did not\nsuggest what he considered to be a reasonable amount to pay for\ninsurance with or without the inclusion of the garages. He said it was\ndifficult for him to provide a comparative quote when he did not know\nwhat was covered in the AXA insurance document.\n28. Mr Sharpe further submitted that Invoice No 90521, dated 14 April 2017\nincluded the sum of £660 for directors' and officers' liability insurance\nbut the Lease does not mention or agree to leaseholders contributing to\nthis. He queried the payability of this sum.\n29. Mr Jackson confirmed that the insurance premium amounts listed for\nthe years 2015-2024 in the Scott Schedule at [390] (as set out above)\nwere correct. He responded that St Giles had confirmed that the garages\nwere included under the policy, however, he did not have any written\nconfirmation from St Giles in support of that contention. He submitted\nthat the insurance policy itself also showed that the garages were\nincluded but the policy was within the excluded supplementary bundle.\n8\n\nMr Jackson asked for further time over the short adjournment to take\nfurther instructions and/or produce these documents.\n30. After the short adjournment Mr Jackson submitted that he did not have\nany documentary evidence from St Giles to demonstrate that the garages\nwere included within the policy. He read from the insurance policy\ndocument dated 2022, version 1, which the Respondent had allegedly\nemailed to the Tribunal and the Applicant during the break (but which\nhas not been received by the Tribunal), which said words to the effect\nthat: “buildings included structures at the premises such as outbuildings,\n. . . canopies, temporary buildings or conveniences”. The word “garages”\ndid not appear within the definition.\n31. As to the challenge in respect of the payability of the sum of £660 for\ndirectors' and officers' liability insurance, Mr Jackson submitted that\nthis did not fall within the scope of the specific items identified for\ndetermination by Judge Korn.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n32. The Tribunal determines that the building insurance premiums for the\nyears 2015-2024 are reasonably incurred.\n33. The Tribunal makes no order on the payability of the sum of £660 for\ndirectors' and officers' liability insurance.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n34. The Tribunal was not impressed by the parties’ lack of supporting\nevidence on this issue, particularly as it was flagged by Judge Korn as an\nitem in dispute.\n35. The Respondent did not disclose the insurance policy documentation\nuntil after the lunch break and did not have any evidence from St Giles\nas to the alleged inclusion of the garages. Even when taking into account\nthe late disclosed insurance policy, which referred to the year 2022 only,\nit was still not clear whether the garages were included under the\ninsurance as they were not referred to specifically.\n36. However, the Applicant did not produce any evidence to show what a\nreasonable premium would be, with or without the garages, nor did he\nsuggest a reasonable alternative figure. In the circumstances, the\nApplicant was unable to make out a prima facie case that the insurance\ncharge was unreasonable and there was no basis upon which the\nTribunal could make such a finding.\n9\n\n37. As to the payability of the sum of £660 for directors' and officers' liability\ninsurance, the Tribunal found that this was outside the scope of the\nspecific items for determination as defined by Judge Korn.\n(Item 4) Entryphone charges in each year, on the basis that the\nannual charge is too high for maintenance\n38. Mr Sharpe submitted that the annual entryphone charge of £384 per\nyear (for the whole block) for the years 2020-2025 was too high and that\nit would be cheaper to pay for individual call-outs at £95 each. He said\nhe was not sure whether the amount paid included rental but that if it\ndid, the landlord should have purchased an entryphone instead as this\nwould be cheaper. He did not have any documentation to support either\ncontention but asked the Tribunal to give a judgment based on his oral\nsubmission. The Tribunal asked if the Applicant had taken account of the\ncapital cost of supply and installation which was included in the rental\ncosts and Mr Sharpe said that he had not.\n39. The Respondent contended that there was no evidence to show the\nentryphone charge was too high. In response to the argument that the\nlandlord should have purchased rather than rented the entryphone\nsystem, Mr Jackson pointed to the Respondent’s enquiries of The\nEntryphone Co Ltd as to the cost of purchasing an entryphone system at\n[1077] of the bundle, which was £6,875.90 plus VAT. He submitted that\nthis was significantly higher than the rental fee and did not include any\nservice/call out costs. The cost per leaseholder for the entryphone each\nyear amounted to £19.20 per year.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n40. The Tribunal determines that the entryphone charges for 2020-2025 in\nthe sum of £384 per year (for the whole block) are reasonably incurred.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n41. The Tribunal did not accept the Applicant’s argument that it would have\nbeen cheaper for the landlord to purchase an entryphone instead of\npaying a rental fee; this assertion was unsubstantiated and contradicted\nby the quote from The Entryphone Co Ltd. The Tribunal noted that the\ncost of £19.20 per year per leaseholder for the entryphone system was\nrelatively low. In any event, the landlord is not required to select the\ncheapest option so long as the chosen option is reasonable.\n(Item 5) The ‘brought forward’ amount of circa £900 in respect of\nthe 2021/22 service charge year\n10\n\n42. Mr Sharpe submitted that the sum of £901.39 referenced “previous agent\nbalance” which appeared at [1360] of the bundle was not payable as it\nwas not clear and he did not know how it had arisen.\n43. Mr Jackson contended that this was a debt claim which was not within\nthe scope of s27A application.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n44. The Tribunal makes no order on item 5.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n45. The “previous agent balance” is not a service charge but an accounting\nissue over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.\n(Item 6) Any penalty charges levied as a consequence of the\nApplicant failing to pay the ‘brought forward’ amount referred to\nimmediately above\n46. Mr Sharpe did not refer to this item in the Scott Schedule but said that\nhe wished to challenge the penalty charges anyway. He identified the\nR&R admin fees of £210 and £60 on an invoice from Rendall and Rittner\ndated 01/04/25 [1360] which he argued were not payable.\n47. Mr Jackson conceded orally that these were not service or administration\ncharges levied by the landlord under the service charge or administrative\nprovisions in the Lease but were charges brought directly against the\nindividual tenant by the management company. As such, they did not fall\nwithin the scope of the s27A application.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n48. The Tribunal makes no order on item 6.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n49. The Respondent conceded that these charges are not payable as service\nor administration charges under the Lease; they are charges over which\nthe Tribunal has no jurisdiction.\n(Item 7) The administrative fees listed on pages 45 and 46 of the\nCMH hearing bundle (being two sums of £210, one of £72 and one of\n£60)\n50. Mr Sharpe agreed that this repeated the sums in item 6.\n11\n\n51. Mr Jackson contended orally that this was a debtors claim which was not\nwithin the scope of s27A application and that these fees are not payable\nas service charges or administration charges under the terms of the\nLease.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n52. The Tribunal makes no order on item 7.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n53. This is a debt-related issue over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction;\nthese fees are not payable as service charges or administration charges\nunder the terms of the Lease.\n(Item 8) ‘Rubbish and car park’ charges in each year, the Applicant\narguing that these issues should be dealt with by the local authority\nat no extra cost to Council Tax payers\n54. Mr Sharpe submitted that this item was about two refuse bins which\nwere hired from Croydon Council for the sum of £478.02 per annum. He\nalleged that these bins could be purchased outright for £190.20 each, so\nfor a one-off payment, the two bins would cost the same price as it costs\nto hire them for one year. He contended therefore that the hire cost was\nunreasonable. Mr Sharpe did not know whether the cost included\ncollection, and he did not have any documentary evidence showing the\nalleged purchase price of the bins.\n55. Mr Jackson responded that the cost was £195 per bin [1142] which did\nnot include collection. He contended that the bins would need regular\nreplacement and needed to be a very specific design for council\ncollection, which may not be available on the open market. He refuted\nthe contention that they could be purchased outright for cheaper, over\nthe lifetime of the bin.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n56. The Tribunal determines that sum of £478.02 per annum for bin hire\n(for the whole block) is reasonably incurred.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n57. The Applicant provided no evidence or alternative quote to show that the\nrefuse bin cost was unreasonable. The Tribunal found that even if it were\npossible for the landlord to buy their own bins cheaper, as suggested by\nthe Applicant, this did not take into account the argument that the bins\nneed regularly replacing and that a very specific design was needed\n12\n\nwhich may not be available on the open market. The Tribunal noted that\nthe bin hire cost was relatively low. In any event, the landlord is not\nrequired to select the cheapest option so long as the chosen option is\nreasonable.\n(Item 9) Accountancy fees for the years from and including 2022/23,\non the basis that they rose sharply in 2022/23 and then were kept at\na similar level thereafter\n58. Mr Sharpe questioned the rise in accountancy fees from £420 per annum\nin 2022 to £1,500 in 2023 and £1,320 in 2024 and alleged that that the\nfees in 2023 and 2024 were not reasonable.\n59. Mr Jackson explained that £1,320 for the year 2024 was a budgeted\nfigure and confirmed that the actual figures were as follows:\n- 2020: £420\n- 2021: £420\n- 2022: £420\n- 2023: £1500\n- 2024: £624\n60. Mr Jackson submitted that there was an undercharge of £240 in each of\nthe years 2021 and 2022 (making a total undercharge of £480) which\nwas recovered in 2023, increasing the actual sum due from £600 to\n£1080. The final sum of £1,500 in 2023 came about owing to a further\n“accrual” of £420 which could not be explained.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n61. The Tribunal determines that the service charge sums reasonably\nincurred in respect of accountancy fees are £1,080 in 2023 and £624 in\n2024. The applicant is responsible for 1/20th of those amounts.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n62. The Tribunal accepts Mr Jackson’s explanation on behalf of the\nRespondent that there was an increase in accountancy fees in 2023\nowing to an undercharge of £240 in each of the years 2021 and 2022,\nwhich was recovered in 2023. The service charge payable in respect of\naccountancy fees for each of the relevant years should have been £660 in\n2021, £660 in 2022, £600 in 2023 and £624 in 2024, which the Tribunal\nfound to be a reasonable increase from £420 in 2020.\n63. However, the Tribunal does not consider it reasonable to charge an\nadditional £420 in 2023 for an alleged accrual which remains\nunexplained. Because of the undercharging in 2021 and 2022, the\n13\n\namount reasonably incurred through the service charge for accountancy\nfees in 2023 is £1080 (not £1,500 as demanded by the Respondent). The\namount reasonably incurred in 2024 is the actual figure of £624.\n(10) Management fees in each year, the Applicant stating that the\nmanagement has been sub-standard and/or that specific\nmanagement responsibilities have not been fulfilled\n64. Mr Sharpe argued that there was disrepair at the property and the\nManaging Agent had not done their job properly. He said the property\nwas not managed well or at all and was “valueless”. He relied on the\nPlanned Maintenance Report of Cardoe Martin [1379] which identified\nthat the building would benefit from a programme of external and\ninternal works. Mr Sharpe said he was prepared to pay 75% of what was\ndue but did not provide any rationale for this percentage. Mr Sharpe was\nunable to identify any individual management item which was\ninadequate and did not provide any alternative quotes. The management\nfees challenged (for the whole block) were as follows:\n- 2016: £3,000.60\n- 2017: £5,001.00\n- 2018: £3,202.00\n- 2019: £4, 153.60\n- 2020: £4,850.20\n- 2021: £5,600.00\n- 2022: £7,368.22\n- 2023: £4,746.00\n65. Mr Jackson argued that the Applicant’s case was not sufficiently\nparticularized and Mr Sharpe had failed to identify what management\nwas substandard or what management responsibilities had not been\nfulfilled. In the alternative, he argued that the repair issues went beyond\nthe scope of the specific items in dispute as identified by Judge Korn.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n66. The Tribunal determines that the service charges for management fees\nin the years 2016-2023 as set out above, are reasonably incurred.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n67. Mr Sharpe was unable to make out a prima facie case that the\nmanagement fees were unreasonably high. He did not provide sufficient\nparticulars, documentation or other basis for the Tribunal to find the\nservice charge for management fees unreasonable or that the\nmanagement of the block had been substandard.\n14\n\n68. As to the allegations of disrepair, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction\nto determine these save as to equitable set-off, which was not part of the\npleaded case. In any event, the future cost of repairs forms part of\nplanned maintenance works which have not yet been actioned and are\nnot due under the service charges.\n(11) Garden maintenance charges for 2015/16 and 2016/17 and all\nother years where those charges have been high, the Applicant to\nclarify which other years if any he is challenging and why he\nconsiders the charges to be too high\n69. Mr Sharpe clarified that he was challenging the years 2022 (£6789.68)\n2023 (£7277.00) and 2024 (£7411.00) but he was unable to explain,\ndespite the direction of Judge Korn, why he considered the charges too\nhigh, other than that they had increased from previous years.\n70. Mr Jackson argued that the Applicant’s case was not sufficiently\nparticularized and Mr Sharpe had failed to comply with the order of\nJudge Korn. He argued that the gardening charges had generally risen in\nline with inflation, noting that inflation in 2022 was 11%.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n71. The Tribunal determines that the service charge for garden maintenance\nin the years 2016-2023 are reasonably incurred.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n72. Mr Sharpe was unable to make out a prima facie case that the garden\nmaintenance fees were unreasonably high. He did not provide sufficient\nparticulars, comparative documentation or any basis whatsoever for the\nTribunal to find the service charge for garden maintenance\nunreasonable. It is not enough simply to say that the charges have\nincreased, without more.\n73. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s contention that the charges have\nrisen roughly in line with inflation. The charge in from 2017- 2019 was\ncirca £5,900-6,000, with a significant drop in 2020-2021 (2020:\n£3852.76; 2021: £5573.10) allegedly due to an administrative error. The\nincrease from the 2017-2019 figure to £6,789 in 2022 is in line with the\n11% inflation rate at that time and the increases in 2023 and 2024\nroughly mirror inflation.\n(12) Company secretarial charges for those years where the\nApplicant considers them to be too high, the Applicant to clarify\nwhich years he is challenging and why he considers the charges to\nbe too high.\n15\n\n74. Mr Sharpe clarified that he was challenging the year 2024 because the\ncharges had increased from £0 to £89 to £480. He set out the charges as\nfollows: 2020 (£0.00), 2021 (£0.00), 2022 (£13.00), 2023 (£89.00) and\n2024 (£480.00). He was unable to identify where he had drawn these\nfigures from, despite the direction of Judge Korn.\n75. Mr Jackson argued that the Applicant’s case was not sufficiently\nparticularized and Mr Sharpe had failed to comply with the order of\nJudge Korn. He submitted that the 2024 figure of £480 was a budgeted\nas opposed to an actual amount and was in line with the previous\nbudgeted amounts which were £420 in 2020 [466], £300 in 2021 [472],\n£300 in 2022 [478], £300 in 2023 and £480 in 2024 [489] of which the\nApplicant would pay one twentieth.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n76. The Tribunal determines that the 2024 budgeted sum of £480 for service\ncharges in respect of company secretarial charges is reasonable, of which\nthe Applicant is responsible for one twentieth.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n77. Mr Sharpe was unable to make out a prima facie case that the budget for\ncompany secretarial fees was unreasonably high. He did not provide\nsufficient particulars, comparative documentation or any basis\nwhatsoever for the Tribunal to find the budgeted service charge for\ncompany secretarial charges unreasonable, despite the direction of\nJudge Korn.\n78. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s contention, based on the\nbudgeted amounts listed in the unaudited service charge accounts from\n2020-2022 that the Applicant is comparing actual charges in those years\nwith a budgeted charge in 2024; he is not comparing like with like.\nApplication under s.20C and refund of fees\n79. At the end of the hearing, the Applicant made an application for a refund\nof the fees that he had paid in respect of the application. Having heard\nthe submissions from the parties and taking into account the\ndeterminations above, the Tribunal does not order the Respondent to\nrefund any fees paid by the Applicant. This is because the Application\nhas failed in most respects.\n80. In the application form and at the hearing the Applicant applied for an\norder under section 20C of the 1985 Act and under para. 5A of Sch 11 to\nthe 2002 Act. The Applicant said the Respondent’s costs of the litigation\nshould not be passed on to the lessees through the\nservice/administration charge because they were already covered by the\n16\n\nRespondent’s insurance, which included legal fees. Mr Jackson\nresponded on behalf of the Respondent that they still had a duty to the\ninsurer as per their contractual terms to recoup costs where possible.\n81. In considering whether to make a s20C order, the Tribunal’s discretion\nis wide and unfettered. Although the application has been mostly\nunsuccessful, the Tribunal finds the Respondent could have narrowed\nthe issues in Item 3 by providing in advance of the hearing the relevant\ninsurance policy and a letter from St Giles confirming the alleged\ninclusion of the garages, even if this challenge was not ultimately\nsuccessful. With respect to Item 9, the Respondent could have conceded\nthat £420 was not reasonably incurred on the basis that its origin was\nuntraceable. Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent\nincreased costs by producing an unnecessarily large bundle which\nincluded several documents which Mr Jackson admitted were\nredundant.\n82. Having heard the submissions from the parties and taking into account\nthe determinations above, the Tribunal determines that it is just and\nequitable in the circumstances for an order to be made under section 20C\nof the 1985 Act and under para. 5A of Sch 11 to the 2002 Act, so that 20%\nof the Respondent’s costs are not to be regarded as relevant costs to be\ntaken into account in determining the amount of any service or\nadministration charge payable by the Applicant.\nName: Judge Moate Date: 5 September 2025\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the Tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\n17\n\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the Tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n18"

      "text": "FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL\nPROPERTY CHAMBER\n(RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY)\nCase reference : LON/00AF/LDC/2025/0724\n7 Versailles Road, Anerley, London,\nProperty :\nSE20 8AX\nSOUTHERN LAND SECURITIES\nApplicant :\nLIMITED\nTOGETHER PROPERTY\nRepresentative : MANAGEMENT LIMITED\nThe leaseholders of the Property, as\nRespondents :\ndetailed in the application\nRepresentative :\nAn Application for a Dispensation\nType of application : Order pursuant to section 20ZA of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985\nTribunal members : JUDGE SHAW\nVenue : PAPER DETERMINATION\nDate of decision : 7th July 2025\nDECISION\n1\n\nDescription of hearing\nThis has been a determination on the papers, without an oral hearing, which has not been\nobjected to by the parties. A face-to-face hearing was not held because none of the parties\nrequested such a hearing, and all the issues could be determined on paper. The documents\nsubmitted to the Tribunal will, as necessary, be referred to below, and all papers\nsubmitted have been perused and the contents considered. The order made is described\nat the end of these reasons.\nDecision of the tribunal\nThe tribunal determines that an order dispensing with the consultation\nprovisions under section 20 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, is appropriate\nin this case, and makes such order.\nThe application\n1. The application is dated 30th April 2025 and the Applicant seeks a determination\npursuant to s.20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”).\nThe hearing\n2. The Applicant sought a Paper Hearing, which was, as stated above, not objected to\nby the Respondents.\nThe background\n3. The Applicant landlord has, applied for dispensation from the statutory consultation\nrequirements in respect of works relating to the installation of a speed bump at the\nentrance to the driveway at the property. The property comprises a Victorian semi-\ndetached house, circa 1870, set out over a basement, ground and 2 upper floors. It is\nsubject to various long leasehold interests.\n4. The Applicant was sent various correspondence during 2024 by Bromley Borough\nCouncil, pointing out that gravel and stones from the entrance driveway was\ncontinuously spilling out onto the public walkway, causing a potential tripping\nhazard. This culminated in the serving of a Warning Notice dated 14th November\n2024, pursuant to the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014, warning\nof various financial and other penalties, unless steps were taken to stop the overspill\nof gravel and other material.\n2\n\n5. Advice was taken and the Applicant was recommended the installation of a speed\nbump. Two competitive estimates were obtained and the more competitive, that of\nJoC Waste and Maintenance was accepted, in the sum of £1380, dated 21st\nFebruary 2025. This an all other documents is contained within the Hearing\nBundle documentation, prepared for this determination.\n6. The work has in fact been completed, and so far as the Tribunal is aware, no further\nproblems or complaints have occurred.\n7. The Applicant contends that it was not practical to give the full 30 day consultation\nperiod required under section 20 of the Act, given the urgency of the works, and given\nthat the Applicant was the subject of a local authority Warning Notice, carrying the\npotential for financial penalties, unless timely action was taken. The leaseholders\nwere nonetheless appraised of the matter throughout, and no objections expressed.\n8. Moreover, Directions were given by this Tribunal on 22nd May 2025, to the effect\nthat the leaseholders be given notice of this (retrospective) application for\ndispensation, and offering the chance to object, and to apply for an oral hearing if so\ndesired.\n9. No such objections have been received nor any such request made.\n10. The application has been supported by a Witness Statement dated 30th June 2025,\nmade by Junique Lawrence of the Applicant’s managing agents confirming all of the\nabove and producing all relevant documents. As noted, all of this was sent to the\nleaseholders in accordance with the above mentioned Directions and neither\ncomment nor objection received in response\nThe Issues\n11. The sole issue in this case is whether the tribunal is satisfied that it is reasonable for\nthe tribunal to dispense with the consultation provisions (section 20 of the Act)\nwhich would otherwise have applied to the qualifying works at the property, as\ndescribed above.\n3\n\nThe tribunal’s decision\n12. The tribunal determines that it is reasonable to dispense with the consultation\nprovisions of section 20 of the Act, pursuant to section 20ZA thereof, and in respect\nof the installation of the speed bump as described above. A dispensation order to\nthis effect is therefore made, as set out below.\nBrief Reasons for the tribunal’s decision\n13. As mentioned, Directions in this case were given on 22nd May 2025. In those\nDirections, the Respondent leaseholders were given the opportunity both to request\nan oral hearing and to object to the application for dispensation.. No such request\nhas been received by the Tribunal, nor has the Tribunal been notified of any objection\nfrom any of the leaseholder Respondents. The work was carried out promptly after\nreceipt of the report of the statutory Warning Notice. The Tribunal is satisfied on the\nevidence before it that it was reasonable to act before formal statutory consultation,\nbecause the problems specified in the Warning were causing the potential for a health\nand safety hazard. It is also satisfied that no prejudice has been caused to the\nRespondents, as described in the Supreme Court decision of Daejan Investments v\nBenson 2013.\n14. DECISION\nFor the reasons set out above, the tribunal determines that it is reasonable to\ndispense with the consultation provisions of section 20 of the Act, pursuant to\nsection 20ZA thereof, and in relation to the installation of a speed bump, as\ndescribed above. A dispensation order to this effect is therefore made. It should be\nunderstood that nothing in this Decision precludes the entitlement of the\nRespondents to challenge the cost, quality, reasonableness or payability of service\ncharges for these works, under the provisions of section 27A of the Act, should they\nhave reason or the desire to do so.\nName: JUDGE SHAW Date: 7th July 2025\n4\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules\n2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), then a\nwritten application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at the regional\noffice which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within 28 days\nafter the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person making the\napplication.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must include\na request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the 28-day time\nlimit; the tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the\napplication for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the tribunal to\nwhich it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number), state the grounds\nof appeal and state the result the party making the application is seeking.\n5"

      "text": "FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL\nPROPERTY CHAMBER\n(RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY)\nCase Reference : CHI/00HG/OCE/2018/0036\nProperty : 20 Allendale Road, Plymouth, Devon P14 6JA\nApplicant : Paul Hankins\nRepresentative : Crosse & Crosse Solicitors LLP\nRespondent : Peter Anthony Lyne (Whereabouts unknown)\nRepresentative :\nType of Application : Collective Enfranchisement (Missing\nLandlord) S.26 and 27 Leasehold Reform\nHousing and Urban Development Act 1993\nTribunal Member : Mr D Banfield FRICS\nDate of Decision : 10 January 2019\nDECISION\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nSummary of Decision\n• The Tribunal has determined for the reasons set out below that\nthe appropriate sum to be paid is £5,697 being a price of £8,737\nless costs of £3,040.\n• The draft TR1 is approved subject to the amendment referred to\nbelow.\nBackground\n1. Deputy District Judge Deacon sitting in the County Court at Plymouth\nmade an order dated 27 June 2018 directing that the First–tier\nTribunal (Property Chamber) should;\na. Approve the form of conveyance which is to be signed on behalf\nof the Defendant by Mr Timothy Paul Selley, Partner of Crosse\nand Crosse Solicitors LLP\nb. Determine the price which would be payable for the Defendant’s\nfreehold interest in the Premises\n2. Directions were made on 30 October 2018 indicating that the\napplication would be dealt with on the papers unless an objection was\nreceived.\n3. No objection has been received and the matter is therefore determined\non the bundle provided by the applicant which includes a report dated\n14 November 2018 from Kit Hepple FRICS who values the premium to\nbe paid at £8,782 proportionally split as Flat 1:- £47 and Flat 2:-\n£8,735.\n4. The Tribunal has not inspected the property.\nEvidence\nValuation\n5. Although Mr Hepple’s report does not contain the usual expert’s\nstatement it does contain a statement of truth and as such is relied\nupon by the Tribunal.\n6. Mr Hepple describes the property as a three storey inner terrace\nbuilding divided into two self-contained flats. There is no front garden\nand a small enclosed courtyard to the rear accessed from a footpath.\n7. The original front door opens into a communal lobby with doors to\nFlats 1&2.\n2\n\n8. Flat 1 is on the first and second floors and comprises:- ground floor\nentrance and stairs to first floor; front living room, rear bedroom,\nbathroom, kitchen, landing and stairs to second floor, second bedroom\n9. Flat 2 is on the ground floor and comprises:-entrance hallway, front\nliving room, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen/diner.\n10. Both flats have modern kitchens and sanitary fittings and separate gas\nfire central heating systems.\n11. The lease for Flat 1 expires 31 August 2172 with nil ground rent. Flat 2\nhas a lease expiring 31 August 2082 with a current ground rent of £50\npa rising to £75 in 31.3 years’ time.\n12. Mr Hepple provides a schedule of one and two bedroom converted flats\nsold between 30 October 2017 and 31 July 2018 at prices between\n£68,000 and £118,250.\n13. Based on the comparables Mr Hepple values the long lease of Flat 1 at\n£125,000; the existing lease of Flat 2 at £87,000 and if extended at\n£100,000.\n14. Mr Hepple takes his relativity of 87% from the Graphs of Relativity\nsection of the My Leasehold website which includes data from a large\nnumber of sources and may be divided into three categories; 2009\nRICS Greater London and England, Published Research and 2015 Data.\n15. A capitalisation rate of 7% is used and a deferment rate of 5.25%. He\ndeparts from the “Sportelli” rate of 55 on the grounds that this is a\nsecondary location and is consistent with a settlement achieved on\nanother flat some 6 months ago. It is also midway between the 5 and\n5.5% which in the past he had achieved in the Windsor/Maidenhead\nareas.\n16. Worked valuations for each flat are provided at pages 159 and 160 of\nthe hearing bundle.\nTerms of Transfer\n17. A draft TR1 has been provided.\nCosts\n18. Deputy Judge Deacon ordered that costs of £3,040.00 should be\ndeducted by way of set off from the price assessed by the Tribunal.\nDecision\nValuation\n3\n\n19. The Tribunal accepts Mr Hepple’s valuation with the exception of his\ndeparture from the Sportelli rate of 5%. Whilst such departures may be\nmade they must be based on substantial evidence which in this case has\nnot been provided.\n20. Applying the variables adopted by Mr Hepple and the Tribunal’s\ndeferment rate of 5% produces a total enfranchisement price of £8,737\nof which £67 relates to Flat 1 and £8,670 to Flat 2.\n21. The Tribunal’s calculations are shown at Appendix 1.\n22. The Tribunal therefore determines that the total price to be\npaid for the freehold interest is £8,737.\n23. After deducting costs of £3,040 as directed in the Order the\nsum of £5,697 is to be paid into court.\nTR1\n24. The draft TR1 is approved subject to the following amendments;\nPanel 8; Delete the receipt by the transferor and insert “The sum\nof £5,697 (five thousand six hundred and ninety-seven pounds)\nhas been paid into Court.\nD Banfield FRICS 10 January 2019\nPERMISSION TO APPEAL\n1. A person wishing to appeal the decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written\napplication to the First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has\nbeen dealing with the case.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the\nTribunal sends to the person making the application written reasons\nfor the decision.\n3.

The tribunal extends the appointment of Mr Paul Cleaver MTPI &\nMARLA, AssocRICS as the Manager of premises situate at Dagnall\nCourt, Dagnall Park, London SE25 5 PJ (‘the Property’) until 30\nJune 2027 pursuant to the terms of the Management Order\ndated 18 May 2017 (as amended on 23 July 2020).\n_____________________________________________________\nThe application\n2. This is an application to extend the Reappointment for Mr. Paul Cleaver\nof Urang Property Management Ltd, as manager of the Property\npursuant to section 24 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985\nThe background\n3. Mr. Cleaver was previously Appointed as Manager from 1 July 2017 to\n30 June 2020 under the terms of a Management Order, dated 18 May\n2017. An Application to vary and extend the terms of the Management\nOrder was made and the Tribunal in its Decision, extended the Existing\nManagement Order for a period of five years, expiring 30 June 2025 (not\n19 June 2025 as stated by Mr Cleaver in his application).\n4. In the application Mr Cleaver sought an extension of his appointment for\na period of two years and sought an amendment to the Management\nOrder to provide him with the power to bring forfeiture proceedings\nagainst the lessee of Flats 1, 3, and 4 for substantial service charge\narrears.\n5. The subject property is a purpose built building containing four flats.\nThe long leaseholder of Flats 1, 3, and 4 is Ms Maher and the long\nleaseholder of Flat 2 is Ms Maxwell. This application was supported by\nMs Caroline Maxwell who provided a Witness Statement dated 4 April\n2025. The respondent supported the application to the extent it accepted\nMr Cleaver’s appointment should be extended by a further period of two\nyears on the same terms as the existing Management Order.\nThe hearing\n6. An oral face to face hearing was held on 21 July 2025 at which Mr Cleaver\nrepresented himself and the respondent was represented by Mr Beetson\nof counsel. Neither long leaseholder attended the hearing.\n7. The tribunal was provided with a digital bundle of 366 pages as well as a\nskeleton argument from the respondent. In his witness statement, Mr\n2\n\nCleaver set out what had been achieved over the course of his\nappointment which included:\nWe have set annual budgets, accounted for collection and service\ncharges resulting in a basic reserve or sinking fund.\nWe have also pursued non-payer accounts.\nSuitable insurance cover is in place for the building.\nHealth and Safety Health and safety improvements recommended in\nthe General Risk Assessment and some remedial action was undertaken\nto date, and schedule updated risk assessments continue to meet\nindustry standards.\nMajor Works Limited progress has been made on Major Works, due to\na shortage of funds.\nMinor repairs and management activities We have performed and\ncontinue to undertake minor repairs, both cyclical and ad hoc in nature,\nand maintain the provision of regular management activities.\n9. This included obtaining a charging order against Ms Maher in respect\nof previous arrears (although no copy of the court order was included\nin the bundle). In his witness statement Mr Cleaver had requested the\nManagement Order to be varied in the following way:\n(a) the grant of additional powers in relation to forfeiture of leases;\n(b) the grant of additional powers for the recovery of bad debts;\n(c) his (the Manager’s) ability to recover legal costs;\n(e) arrears of charges.\n10. Mr Cleaver also informed the tribunal that it was his intention to:\n(a) To collect outstanding arrears and costs;\n(b) To save up Reserve Funds towards the Upgrade of the Fire Alarm\nand External Works;\n(c) To complete the Major Works.\n11. The tribunal was also provided with a witness statement dated 16 May\n2025 of Mr Justin John Toohig a director of the respondent company\nwhich stated:\nFor the avoidance of doubt, EKL requests that any amended\nmanagement order remain substantially in the same terms as\nthe order included within Judge Timothy Powell's decision\ndated 23 July 2020…EKL do not wish for the Applicant to be\n3\n\ngranted any additional powers in relation to the Building or to\nbe specifically empowered to commence the forfeiture process\nor collect ground rents on EKL’s behalf.\n12. During the course of the hearing Mr Cleaver withdrew his expressed wish\nto be granted powers of forfeiture and requested his appointment be\nextended for a further five-year period.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n13. The tribunal is satisfied it is appropriate to extend the appointment of\nMr Paul Cleaver for a further two years i.e. until 30 June 2027.\n14. The tribunal determines the current form of Management Order (as\namended by Judge Powell) is sufficient to provide Mr Cleaver with the\nnecessary powers to carry out his responsibilities.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n15. In reaching its decision the tribunal was satisfied that the Manager had\nmade a positive contribution to the proper management of the building\nand was also satisfied he would continue to do so. Further, the tribunal\nwas satisfied Mr Cleaver had successfully fully utilised the powers given\nto him under the existing Management Order, to address the arrears of\nservice charges accrued by Ms Maher.\n16. The tribunal recognises Mr Cleaver’s frustration at the delays caused by\nthe county court process, both in obtaining judgement and in seeking to\neffectively enforce it. However, as the landlord has declined to pursue\nforfeiture proceedings, Mr Cleaver appeared aware of the need to\npursue all other avenues of enforcement available to him.\n17. The tribunal was surprised to learn the respondent had given little or no\nthought to appointing its own managing agent, in view of the fact the\nManagement Order for this relatively uncomplicated Property had been\nin place for 7 years and the management of the building had improved.\nThis was despite Ms Maher’s persistent failure to pay service charges and\nthe respondent’s refusal to initiate forfeiture proceedings.\n18. Consequently, the tribunal concluded that it was appropriate for Mr\nCleaver’s appointment to be extended for a further 24 months. This\nperiod allows Mr Cleaver the opportunity to implement intended further\nprojects (subject to funding). This extension of Mr Cleaver’s\nappointment also provides the respondent, with an opportunity to\nconsider appointing its own managing agent and implementing its\nrepairing and maintenance obligations under the leases when the period\nof Mr Cleaver’s appointment comes to an end.\n4\n\nName: Judge Tagliavini Date: 30 July 2025\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n5"

The Regional Judge found that this application to the extent\nthat it raised the issue of the service charge for the service charge year 2016/17 was\nidentical to the application made in this regard by the Applicant, Ms Sarah Jane\nSaunders, in case reference BIR/OOFY/LIS/2017/0044. Consequently, the Regional\nJudge directed in exercise of his case management powers under Rule 6(3)(b) of The\nTribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013 (‘the Tribunal\nRules’) that both sets of proceedings should be consolidated and that they should be\nheard together.\n2 In these Directions, the Regional Judge also indicated that he had added the freeholder of\nthe property, Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited, as the second Respondent to\nthe application made by Ms Babadi. However, he further directed that, as Park West\nRTM Company Limited had acquired the right to manage the buildings known as Park\nWest, the second Respondent should play no part in the proceedings. Nevertheless, the\nsecond Respondent should be sent a copy of the Tribunal’s decision.\n3 In addition, the Directions included an opportunity to object for any of the parties to\neither application.\n4 Following subsequent e-mail correspondence between Ms Babadi and the Tribunal, Ms\nBabadi applied in an e-mail dated 28 February 2018 to the Tribunal for an order under\nRule 23 of the Tribunal Rules whereby the application made by Ms Sarah Jane Saunders\n(BIR/OOFY/LIS/2017/0044) should be specified as the lead case in respect of the\ncommon issue, namely the ‘service charge year 2016/2017 in the sum of £1,872.49’. In\nthat e-mail, Ms Babadi also applied under Rule 23(2) for her related application\n(BIR/OOFY/LIS/005) to be stayed pending the decision of the Tribunal in the lead case.\nIn a letter dated 5 March 2018, the first Respondent, Park West RTM Company Limited,\nraised no objection to Ms Babadi’s e-mail application.\n5 On 12 March 2018, the Regional Judge issued Directions which identified the common\nissue in the applications made by Ms Sarah Jane Saunders and Ms Babadi as the ‘Service\nCharge year 2016/2017 in the sum of £1,872.49’, specified that the application made by\nMs Sarah Jane Saunders should be the lead case in relation to that common issue, and\nstayed Ms Babadi’s related application pending the decision of the Tribunal in the lead\ncase. The Directions also indicated that the decision of the Tribunal in the lead case in\nrelation to the common issue would be binding on all the parties to Ms Babadi’s\napplication, subject to Rule 23(6) of the Tribunal Rules which enables a party to Ms\nBabadi’s application to apply in writing to the Tribunal within 28 days for a direction that\nsuch decision is not binding.\n6 In the light of the resolution of this preliminary matter, subsequent references in this\ndecision are to Ms Sarah Jane Saunders (Ms Saunders) and Park West RTM Company\nLimited (Park West RTM) in their respective capacities as the Applicant and the first\nRespondent in case BIR/OOFY/LIS/2017/0044.\n2\n\nIntroduction/General Background\n7 This is a decision made in respect of an Application (‘the Application’) by Ms Sarah Jane\nSaunders (Ms Saunders), who is the leaseholder of Apartment 13, Park West, Derby\nRoad, Nottingham NG7 1LU (‘the subject property’) which was dated 13 November 2017\nand received by the Tribunal on 22 November 2017. Ms Saunders seeks the following -\nfirst, under section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, a determination of the\npayability and reasonableness of service charges in respect of the subject property\n(‘section 27A application’) for the period 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017; secondly, under\nParagraph 5 of Schedule 11 to the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, an\norder in relation to the liability to pay “an administration charge in respect of litigation\ncosts” (‘2002 Act application’); and, thirdly, under section 20C of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985, an order for the limitation of costs incurred by Park West RTM in\nconnection with these proceedings to the extent that all or any of those costs are not to be\ntaken into account in determining the amount of any service charge payable by Ms\nSaunders (‘section 20C application’). Park West RTM employs Walton and Allen\nManagement Limited (‘W & A’) as managing agents.\n8 This decision also incorporates the Tribunal’s finding in relation to an application by\nPark West RTM (BIR/OOFY/LDC/2018/0003) dated 17 April 2018, which was made in\nthe course of these proceedings and relates to the section 27A application, for an order\nunder section 20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 for dispensation, insofar as was\nnecessary, of the consultation requirements provided for by section 20 of that Act\n(‘dispensation application’).\n9 Directions were issued by a procedural judge on 7 December 2017 and by the Regional\nJudge on 13 February 2018 and on 12 March 2018 respectively. The former related to the\nApplication and were concerned, principally, with the processes associated with the\npreparation and submission of statements of case and related documents by parties to\nthat Application.\nAs indicated above in the consideration of the preliminary matter (see, paragraphs 1-6),\nsubsequent Directions issued on 13 February 2018 directed, inter alia, that application\n(BIR/OOFY/LIS/2018/0005) made by Ms Babadi be consolidated with the Application,\nand that proceedings relating to these applications should be heard together, whilst\nDirections issued on 12 March 2018, in pursuance of Rule 23 of the Tribunal Rules,\ndirected that the Application be treated as the leading case in respect of the common\nissue in each of the applications, namely the ‘Service Charge year for 2016/2017 in the\nsum of £1,872.49’ and that Ms Babadi’s application be stayed pending the decision of the\nTribunal in the Application. The latter Directions also indicated that the decision of the\nTribunal in relation to the common issue would be binding on all the parties to Ms\nBabadi’s application, subject to the invocation of Rule 23(6).\n10 Statements of case and related documents were duly filed by Ms Saunders and Park West\nRTM respectively.\n11 The Tribunal inspected the building known as Park West within which the subject\nproperty is situated, externally, on 19 March 2018 in the presence of Ms Saunders and\nher representative, Mr Healey, the representatives of Park West RTM, namely Mr\nWayman and Ms Tamsin Cox of Counsel, Mr Simon Temporal and Mr Brent Weightman\nof W & A, and Ms Babadi. Thereafter, an internal inspection of Apartment 65 was\nundertaken at the invitation of Ms Babadi, primarily, to view the external elevations from\ninside the building.\n3\n\n12 Following the inspection, a Hearing was held on the same day at Nottingham Justice\nCentre, Carrington Street, Nottingham. In addition to Ms Saunders and, her\nrepresentative, Mr Healey, and Mr Wayman and Ms Tamsin Cox of Counsel for Park\nWest RTM, Ms Babadi and Mr Temporal were present; the former as an interested party,\nthe latter to give evidence in his capacity as Property and Estate Director of W & A and in\npursuance of his initial witness statement. Mr Healey and Ms Cox presented the cases for\nMs Saunders and Park West RTM respectively. The latter submitted a skeleton argument\nto the Tribunal upon which she relied in making her presentation on behalf of Park West\nRTM. The Application was part-heard on 19 March 2018.\n13 The Hearing resumed on 24 April 2018 at the Nottingham Justice Centre. In the\nmeantime and at the request of the Tribunal, Mr Temporal had submitted a supplemental\nwitness statement dated 17 April 2018. Also, the dispensation application was made on\nbehalf of Park West RTM. The dispensation application was not heard on 24 April 2018,\nand, consequently, the Tribunal issued Directions on 27 April 2018 which provided Ms\nSaunders with an opportunity to respond in writing to that application with a right of\nreply in writing reserved for Park West RTM. Written representations in respect of the\ndispensation application, which were dated 14 May 2018 and 21 May 2018, were\nsubmitted on behalf of Ms Saunders and Park West RTM respectively.\nFacts\n14 The Application relates to the subject property which is situated in one of three purpose-\nbuilt blocks of apartments constituting Park West, 158 Derby Road, Nottingham NG7\n1LU (Park West) which was constructed circa 2003. Each block has a communal staircase\nand a passenger lift and comprises seven storeys. In total, there are 87 apartments within\nthe development. An inner forecourt provides access to and egress from the apartments.\nThe subject property is located in Block B. Park West is adjacent to a building known as\nthe Cigar Factory, a four-storey block of apartments, to which it is connected by a\nwalkway. The Cigar Factory has a service charge which is distinct from the service charge\nof Park West.\nPark West is bounded by Derby Road, Ilkeston Road, Elliott Street and Hermon Street. It\nis situated within a reasonable distance of Nottingham City Centre.\n15 Ms Saunders is the registered leasehold owner of Apartment 13, Park West, a title which\nshe holds under the terms of a lease dated 2 December 2003 and made between (1)\nSeasongreet Limited, (2) Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited, (3) Capital Invest\nLimited and (4) Sandra Healy and granted for a term of 999 years from 1 January 2003\n(‘the lease’). Ms Saunders was registered as the leasehold owner of Apartment 13 on 29\nAugust 2008.\n16 The second Respondent, Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited owns the freehold\nof Park West and the Cigar Factory. Park West RTM is a Right to Manage Company. It is\nresponsible for the management of Park West and, as indicated above, employs W & A to\nassist with that management. Ms Saunders is not a member of Park West RTM.\n17 The lease provides for the payment of a service charge by the leaseholders of Park West in\naccordance with the terms of clause 3.2. The meaning of ‘Service Charge’ is given in\nclause 1.7 of the lease. The lease also provides for the payment by the leaseholders of a\n‘Special Contribution’, which means, according to clause 1.8, any amount which the\nCompany (Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited, the second Respondent), (or,\npresumably, by inference its delegate, Park West RTM), ‘shall reasonably consider\nnecessary for any of the purposes set out in the Fifth Schedule…for which no or\ninadequate provision has been made within the Service Charge and for which no or\ninadequate reserve provision has been made under the Fourth Schedule, Part II,\n4\n\nparagraph 2(ii)’. Clause 3.4 of the lease provides that the leaseholders shall ‘pay to the\nCompany on demand any due proportion…specified in clause 1.8…of any Special\nContribution that may be levied by the Company.’ The Fifth Schedule relates, specifically,\nto ‘purposes for which the Service Charge is to be applied’, but, also applies, in view of the\nwording of clause 1.8, to the purposes for which the ‘Special Contribution’ is to be\napplied. The purposes set out in the Fifth Schedule include, inter alia, first, the costs\nincurred in management, for example, the costs and expenses incurred in the collection\nof rents and service charges and the costs, fees and expenses paid to duly appointed\nmanaging agents, and, secondly, the costs of decoration and repair of the exterior of Park\nWest. In the latter respect, the Fifth Schedule, Part II, paragraph 1(a) provides that\nredecoration of the exterior of Park West shall be undertaken:\n‘As often as may in the opinion of the Company [Holding and Management (Solitaire)\nLimited] be necessary to prepare and decorate in appropriate colours with good quality\nmaterials and in a workmanlike manner all the outside rendering wood and metalwork of\nthe Block [Park West] usually decorated.’\n18 Leaseholders are also obliged to observe and perform the obligations set out in the Third\nSchedule to the lease (clause 3.1). These obligations include the following obligation in\nparagraph 2(b) of the Third Schedule:\n‘To pay to the Company [Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited] on a full\nindemnity basis all costs and expenses incurred by the Company or the Company’s\nSolicitors in enforcing the payment by the Lessee of any Rents Service Charge\nMaintenance Adjustment Special Contribution or other monies payable by the Lessee\nunder the terms of this Lease.’\nThe Application – Background\n19 The Application relates to the service charge demanded of Ms Saunders in the sum of\n£1,872.49 payable for the period 1 April 2016 until 31 March 2017 to the extent that it\nconsists of certain costs of and arising out of major works (‘the works’) comprising,\nbroadly, the external cleaning and redecoration of Park West.\n20 Following a consultation under section 20 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (‘section\n20 consultation’) conducted by W & A on behalf of Park West RTM, the contract to\nundertake the works was awarded to Building Transformation at a price of £81,254.68.\nThe works were to be undertaken by abseiling rather than through the use of scaffolding.\n21 W & A took responsibility for the management of the works prior to their commencement\n(pre-commencement project management) and for their management whilst those works\nwere being undertaken (project management during the site period). Initially, the costs\nfor such project management were £32,798.61 and £10,250.00 respectively.\n22 Additional costs were attributed to the appointment of an Architect (to carry out an\ninspection, produce a report and recommend appropriate finishes to be applied to Park\nWest) for a fee of £750.00, the provision of a secure welfare unit (portable toilet) for the\nuse of site operatives in a location adjacent to Park West at a cost of £4,231.25, and the\nappointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator (to provide advice and assistance on various\nmatters relating to health and safety) for a fee of £1,250.00.\n23 More specifically, the works to the extent that they are material to the Application were\ndescribed in the course of the section 20 consultation as follows:\n‘EXTERNAL CLEANING AND DECORATIONS TO THE PARK WEST\nBUILDINGS.\n5\n\nUsing an abseil company who will secure themselves to the building roof; abseil down\nand pressure clean all elevations; apply two coats of masonry paint to render and two\ncoats of stain to timber cladding; wash, rinse and leather off existing powder coated\nwindow frames, patio doors and glazing.\nTo pressure clean all elevations; apply two coats of Cream masonry paint to the existing\nrendered surfaces; apply 2…coats of woodstain…to the existing external timber full height\ncladding.\na Courtyard elevations\nb Elliott Street elevation\nc Ilkeston Road elevation\nd Herman Street elevation\ne Derby Road elevation\nMiscellaneous\ne Clean out all existing guttering…\nCONTINGENCY\nArchitects Fees\ng To carry out an inspection, produce a report and recommend appropriate finishes\nto be applied to this listed building within the Canning Circus conservation area.\nHealth and Welfare Facilities\nh To provide a secure welfare unit for the use of site operatives; includes lighting,\nheating, toilet, washbasin, hot and cold running water, sink unit, microwave oven,\ntable and chairs and drying room. This is a minimum requirement under CDM-C\nand HSE legislation. This will be located in the fenced off area adjacent to Elliott\nRoad.\nCDM-C Co-Ordinator\ni To provide suitable and sufficient advice and assistance in order to help\ncompliance with duties, ensure that the project is notified to HSE, Co-ordinate\ndesign work, planning and other preparation where relevant to health and safety,\nidentify and collect pre-construction information and advise the client on the need\nfor surveys etc., promptly provide pre-construction health and safety information,\nmanage the flow of health and safety information, advise on the suitability of the\ninitial construction phase health and safety plan and the arrangements made to\nensure that welfare facilities are on site from the start and produce the health and\nsafety file.\nFees & Management Costs\nj Pre Commencement Project Management:\nPre Commencement Section 20 Works; To included liaising with all sub-\ncontractors, suppliers, CDM-C Co-Ordinator, producing documentation, material\n6\n\nspecifications, liaising with architect, provide Bill of Quantities, programme of\nworks, site visits to meet with various contractors, and all pre-start administration\ncosts.\nProject Manager\nQuantity Surveyor\nPlanner/Programmer\nAdministration\nk Project Management – Site Period\nSection 20 Works; To included Project Management fee for liaising with all sub-\ncontractors, suppliers, CDM-C Co-Ordinator, producing documentation and\nmonitoring progress of works, liaising with architects and contractors, continued\nprogramming of the works by Planner/Programmer, daily site visits by Project\nManager, cost control by the Quantity Surveyor and all administration costs\nrequired to complete the works.\nProject Manager\nQuantity Surveyor\nPlanner/Programmer\nAdministration’\nThe Application - Issues in Dispute\nSection 27A application\n24 In her Application, Ms Saunders set out the following questions which she wished the\nTribunal to decide:\na. Has the RTM Company complied with the consultation requirements under Section 20\nfor the first set of works? If not, is the Tenant’s liability for these major works capped at\n£250?\nb. If the RTM Company has complied with the consultation requirements for the first set\nof works:\ni) Were the first set of works defective?\nii) Is the tenant liable for the Architects fee of £750?\niii) Is it reasonable to pay £4,231.25 (for each block) to hire a secure welfare unit?\niv) It is reasonable to pay the managing agent £1,250 to act as a CDM-C Co-Ordinator.\nv) Is it reasonable the managing agent should be paid £32,798.61 for Pre-\nCommencement Project Management given failings identified and overall cost?\nvi) Is the cost of £10,250 to Project Manage the Site Period reasonable?\nc. Should the RTM Company have undertaken a second S20 Consultation prior to\nentering into a new contract for works proposed to start in Spring 2018?\nd. Is the Tenant entitled to an equitable off-set for damages against the RTM Company\nfor the RTM Company’s breach of Covenant to Repair, given this work was needed in\n2012 (when Consultation was started and abandoned)? What is the extra amount now\npayable in 2017 – the extra cost on top of what the Tenant would have paid in 2012?\n7\n\n25 Subsequently, Ms Saunders made no submissions and adduced no evidence, either in her\nstatement of case, witness statement or, through Mr Healey at the Hearing, in relation to\nquestions c) and d). As a precursor to her challenge to each of the substantive matters\nidentified in parts i) to vi) of question b), Ms Saunders questioned in her oral and written\nevidence the validity of the section 20 consultation which had been undertaken. Subject\nthereto, matters pertaining to each of the substantive matters in question b) were\npursued by Ms Saunders within the context of the generic disputes which she identified\nin her statement of case as arising between the parties in relation to the section 27A\napplication. These were outlined as follows:\n‘1.1.1 DISPUTE 1 – The management fees charged by the Managing Agent\n(36% of total cost) to oversee these basic works are unreasonable due to non-\nperformance of some tasks stated, duplication of other tasks and (generally)\nbeing excessive in nature; a figure of 0-10% would be more reasonable and\nin-line with industry norms.\n1.1.2 DISPUTE 2 – The relevant major works were not of a reasonable\nstandard – The works were halted after a few weeks and have never recommenced. To\ndate, the reason for this has not been fully disclosed to any lessee.’\n26 Park West RTM rejected each of the above submissions made by Ms Saunders and\nresponded, broadly, as follows.\n27 First, Ms Cox stated in her skeleton argument, upon which she relied in presenting the\ncase for Park West RTM, that Park West RTM had performed the required consultation\nexercise.\n28 Secondly, as to the above generic disputes identified by Ms Saunders, Park West RTM in\nits statement of case refuted Ms Saunders’ submissions that the project management\nfees, which had been charged, were unreasonable in that tasks had not been completed or\nthat there had been duplication of tasks, and that, generally, they were excessive. Park\nWest RTM also asserted that there was a need for the architect and CDM-C co-ordinator\nto perform their respective tasks. In Park West RTM’s opinion, following interventions on\nthe part of W & A, the works had been completed to a reasonable standard.\nMs Cox added that the sums expended on the works and which had been challenged\nwere reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances and arose out of Park West\nRTM’s determination to limit the cost of the works, particularly by avoiding expenditure\non very extensive scaffolding; the net result was to decrease the overall cost, as an\napproach using scaffolding would have cost £100,000.00 more than was spent; the works\nhad been completed and to a reasonable standard, notwithstanding failures of Building\nTransformation, because Park West RTM and W & A had expended significant time and\neffort in bringing Building Transformation to account and in ensuring that the works\nwere completed ‘timeously and properly’. She indicated that the actual costs of the works,\nincluding the management costs, were less than was predicted in the section 20\nconsultation (including the costs of resolving problems with the standard of work\nundertaken by Building Transformation) and were reasonable within the meaning of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 (‘the 1985 Act’).\n2002 Act application\n29 In her Application, Ms Saunders made an application, the 2o02 Act application, for an\norder of the Tribunal which would reduce or extinguish her liability to pay “an\nadministration charge in respect of litigation costs”. The subject matter of this application\ncomprises two charges, each of £60.00, which had been included in her service charge\n8\n\naccount for 2017 for non-payment of service charge. These charges were described as ‘late\npayment admin fees’. Park West RTM opposed the making of such an order.\nSection 20C application\n30 In her Application, Ms Saunders made an application, the section 20C application, for an\norder of the Tribunal that costs incurred by Park West RTM in connection with the\nproceedings before the Tribunal should not be included as part of the service charge\npayable by her. Park West RTM opposes the making of such an order.\n31 The parties’ submissions on each of the above applications and on the matters to which\nthey give rise are set out in paragraphs 39-87 of this Decision.\nStatutory frameworks\n32 The relevant statutory provisions for the section 27A application, the 2002 Act\napplication and the section 20C application are as follows.\nSection 27A

this Schedule “administration charge” means an amount payable by a\ntenant of a dwelling house as part of or in addition to the rent which is payable, directly\nor indirectly-\n…\n(c) in respect of a

only to the extent that the amount of the charge is reasonable.\n37 Paragraph 5 of Part 1 of Schedule 11 to the 2002 Act, so far as material, provides for\nliability to pay administration charges as follows:\n5(1) An application may be made to the appropriate tribunal for a determination whether\nan administration charge is payable, and, if it is, as to-\n(a) the person by whom it is

charge payable by the tenant or any other person or persons\nspecified in the application.\n…\n(3) The court or tribunal to which the application is made may make such order on the\napplication as it considers just and equitable in the circumstances.\nSubmissions\nSection 27A application\nDispute 1\n39 The following paragraphs (40-75) summarise the submissions of the parties relating to\nthe section 20 consultation (validity), management costs (pre-commencement and\nproject management (site period) and the specific costs for the Architect, health and\nwelfare facilities and the CDM-C co-ordinator.\nSection 20 consultation – validity\n40 Initially, Ms Saunders in her witness statement dated 10 January 2018, which\naccompanied her similarly dated statement of case that had been submitted on her behalf\nby Mr Healey, referred to a section 20 consultation relating to the external painting of\nPark West that had been initiated by W & A in 2012 (‘2012 consultation’). In this regard,\nMs Saunders stated that she received a Stage 1 consultation letter from W & A in March\n2012. She added that she did not respond to this letter as she did not wish to suggest any\ncontractor from whom a quote for the proposed work might be sought. Ms Saunders\nintimated that, thereafter, she did not hear anything further in relation to this\nconsultation. In her statement of case, Ms Saunders indicated that this letter made\nreference to the painting work that was proposed and, in respect of that work, to the\nerection of full height scaffolding, the removal of paint and painting equipment and\npurchase of a pavement licence. At the Hearing, Mr Healey opined that these proposed\nworks may have been undertaken at a lower cost than the cost of the works.\n11\n\n41 In her witness statement, Ms Saunders also outlined the manner in which the section 20\nconsultation which was pertinent to her Application was conducted referring to various\nconsultation letters she received from W & A. Further, as will be seen (see, paragraphs\n42-44), Ms Saunders referred in her statement of case to these letters and the notices\nwhich accompanied them in furtherance of the section 20 consultation.\n42 Hence, in her witness statement, Ms Saunders stated that she received the Stage 1\nconsultation letter relating to the section 20 consultation pertaining to her Application\nfrom W & A in the post ‘in the middle of April 2015’. The letter was dated 13 April 2015. It\nindicated that there were 30 days within which any suggestions about a company which\nmight be approached to provide a quote for the works should be made and that such\nsuggestions should be submitted no later than 13 May 2015. Ms Saunders intimated that\nshe received this letter a couple of days after 13 April 2015. Ms Saunders opined that this\ndid not allow sufficient days for responses and that the period should have been ‘30 days\nafter allowing a few days for postage time’. In the event, Ms Saunders said that she did\nnot suggest any contractor to whom an approach might be made.\n43 Further, Ms Saunders explained that she received the Stage 2 consultation letter sent by\nW & A on 4 June 2015. Ms Saunders stated that this letter was dated 1 June 2015 and\nprovided that responses to it should be submitted no later than 1 July 2015. On reading\nthe letter, Ms Saunders said she was concerned about the relative costs of carrying out\nthe works and the project management costs of W & A, the breakdown of the project\nmanagement costs which included matters which she had not seen in other section 20\nconsultation exercises with which she was familiar and, in view of the work to be\nundertaken, the need for and costs of an Architect, health and welfare facilities and a\nCDM-C co-ordinator. Ms Saunders indicated that she posted a response to W & A within\nthe 30 day deadline, although she could not remember when it was sent nor did she keep\na copy of her response. Her recollection was that she raised the following in her response\n– the suitability of the companies, which had submitted quotes for the external painting\nat Park West, following checks which she had carried out at Companies House and which\nshowed that Balmoral Interiors Limited was a carpet, rug, floor and wall covering\ncompany, whilst Building Transformation Limited was a dormant company; the\nappointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator when this was a small job; the perceived\nunreasonably high pre-commencement and site period management fees of W & A; her\ninquiries in a paint shop which suggested that the proposed two coats of paint on the\nrender with a view to securing a 10 year guarantee would be insufficient in the absence of\npre-works and primers/undercoats; the question of whether render should be painted;\nthe appointment of an Architect when Park West is not a listed building and when the\nworks did not involve any redesign, and, finally, the failure of W & A to properly manage\nPark West and their abandonment of previous consultations.\n44 Ms Saunders indicated that she received the Stage 3 consultation letter in August 2015.\nThis stated that the contract for the works had been awarded to Building Transformation.\nMs Saunders pointed out that the documents accompanying that letter included a\nsummary of observations, which had been made by leaseholders in response to the Stage\n2 consultation letter, although it was stated that any comments received after the\ndeadline of 1 July 2015 were not included. She noticed that her comments were not\nincluded within the summary even though her comments had been made within the\nspecified 30 days. Ms Saunders noted that some leaseholders had raised matters which\nshe had highlighted in her response to the Stage 2 consultation letter, namely the high\nproject management fee and the necessity for the appointments of the Architect and the\nCDM-C co-ordinator. The high cost of the provision of the health and welfare facilities\nhad also been alluded to by some respondents. At the Hearing, Mr Healey suggested that\nif Ms Saunders’ comments had been taken into account the dispute about the costs\nrelating to the works may have been avoided.\n12\n\n45 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders reiterated, inter alia, the opinion which she had\nexpressed in her witness statement that the Stage 1 consultation letter (notice) relating to\nthe section 20 consultation pertaining to her Application did not allow sufficient time for\nleaseholders to respond; no time had been allowed in the stated 30 day response period\nfor posting. In this respect, Ms Saunders cited Trafford Housing Trust Ltd v Rubenstein\nand others [2013] UKUT 581 in which, in the opinion of Ms Saunders, the Upper\nTribunal decided that for the purposes of determining the date upon which the 30 day\nconsultation period ends the date of the notice was not the date it was printed nor the\ndate upon which it was posted, but rather the date upon which (depending on the means\nof delivery) it can be expected to be delivered to the person being consulted. From this,\nMs Saunders concluded that in relation to the Stage 1 consultation letter (notice) no\nallowance was made for the posting of the letter (notice) as the letter (notice) was\nprepared on 13 April 2015 and required a response by 13 May 2015. In this circumstance,\nshe suggested that it could be argued that the absence of an allowance for posting\ninvalidates this notice. Subsequent letters (notices) also failed to meet the ‘one calendar\nmonth deadline’. However, Ms Saunders accepted that she did not feel that she was\nprejudiced by this error, because she did not send a response to the Stage 1 consultation\nletter (notice) and did not plan to nominate any contractor. Ms Saunders confirmed this\nlack of prejudice at the Hearing.\nOn Day 1 of the Hearing, Mr Healey submitted that Ms Saunders had presented sufficient\nevidence to warrant a finding that the section 20 consultation requirements had not been\nmet and that, as a consequence, the £250.00 cap on Ms Saunders’ liability to contribute\nto the cost of the works might be imposed.\n46 Ms Saunders added that some confusion had arisen among leaseholders because a\nsimultaneous section 20 consultation exercise had been conducted by W & A for works to\nthe exterior of the Cigar Factory.\n47 In her skeleton argument, Ms Cox stated that the section 20 consultation had been\nperformed as required by section 20 the 1985 Act and Regulation 7 and Part II of the\nFourth Schedule to the Service Charge (Consultation etc.) (England) Regulations 2003\n(‘2003 Regulations’). In this respect, Ms Cox explained that an initial notice dated 13\nApril 2015 had been served which set out what works were proposed and the reasons for\nthose works, and invited observations from leaseholders and nominations from\nleaseholders for contractors to carry out the works, whilst a further notice provided\ndetails of two of the estimates which had been received, namely those estimates tendered\nby PWC and Building Transformation, and observations from leaseholders were invited.\nMs Cox stated that the final notice informed leaseholders that the contract for the works\nhad been awarded to Building Transformation. At the Hearing and within the context of\nthis sequence of notices, Ms Cox discounted in the course of questioning Ms Saunders,\nfirst, the company searches which Ms Saunders had conducted noting, in particular, that\nBuilding Transformation which had been awarded the contract to carry out the works\nclearly differed from the company in respect of which Ms Saunders had carried out her\nsearch, and, secondly, the opinion which Ms Saunders said had been expressed by the\npaint shop as to the manner in which the painting of Park West should be undertaken –\nthis was neither evidence nor the opinion of an expert.\nMs Cox informed the Tribunal that the leaseholders of Park West were provided with\ncopies of the equivalent notices relating to the Cigar Factory. However, Ms Cox averred\nthat the costs relating to the Cigar Factory were irrelevant to the determination of the\nApplication, because those costs were not charged to the residents of Park West and do\nnot form part of the demand challenged by the Applicant. In his evidence, Mr Temporal\nconfirmed that, initially, estimates had been sought for work to be undertaken on Park\nWest and the Cigar Factory and that the projected costs in the resulting specifications\n13\n\nwere apportioned between the two buildings. Ms Cox noted that work had not begun on\nthe Cigar Factory because of insufficient funds.\n48 Ms Cox also addressed the question of the validity of the notices which had been raised,\nspecifically, by Ms Saunders in her Application and, subsequently, in her statement of\ncase and witness statement. In this regard, Ms Cox denied Ms Saunders’ statement that\nthe section 20 notices served on her by Park West RTM arrived after the date stated in\nthem with the result that Ms Saunders had those notices for a few days less than the 30-\nday relevant period specified in the Regulations. If, however, Ms Saunders’ statement to\nthis effect was taken to be correct, Ms Cox stated that Park West RTM sought\ndispensation in respect of those few days under section 20ZA of the 1985 Act. In this\nrespect, Ms Cox reminded the Tribunal that Ms Saunders had admitted, expressly, in her\nstatement of case that she suffered no prejudice as a result of the delay which she said\nhad occurred. Further, Ms Cox informed the Tribunal that the section 20 process was\nstreamlined in such a way that such a delay, if it occurred which was not accepted, could\nnot have caused any prejudice. In this respect, Ms Cox indicated that responses from\nleaseholders were invited by e-mail with the result that time could be saved in replying,\nand all the details about the works were provided with the notices and, hence, there was\nno need for leaseholders to visit the Agent’s offices to find out details about the works.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the standard form of wording used in the notices, Ms Cox\nintimated that late responses from leaseholders were accepted and considered after the\nvarious deadlines. In his oral evidence, Mr Temporal informed the Tribunal that W & A\nhad not received a letter from Ms Saunders in response to the Stage 2 consultation notice,\nbut, in his opinion, the matters relating to the works which Ms Saunders recalled raising\nin her letter were covered in the replies given by W & A to queries raised by other\nleaseholders.\nIn her skeleton argument, Ms Cox supported the grant of dispensation, insofar as it was\nnecessary, on the grounds that no prejudice had been suffered, which had been admitted\nby Ms Saunders, and no suggestion had been made by Ms Saunders that an alteration in\nthe timing would or could have altered the outcome of the section 20 procedure. In doing\nso, Ms Cox referred the Tribunal to the Supreme Court judgment in Daejan v Benson\n[2013] UKSC 14 (‘Daejan’). She submitted that there was no justification for imposing a\n£250.00 cap on the recovery of costs from Ms Saunders.\n49 Park West RTM made a formal application for dispensation, the dispensation\napplication, which was dated 17 April 2018 and received by the Tribunal on 19 April 2018\n(see, paragraph 8), and variously described on Park West RTM’s behalf as made ‘for\ncompleteness’ and as a ‘formality’ in the light of Ms Saunders’ persistence on Day 1 of the\nHearing with the argument that the section 20 consultation requirements had not been\nmet. The dispensation application included a request for it to be heard on Day 2 of the\nHearing. However, the Tribunal decided that, in view of the proximity to Day 2, namely\n24 April 2018, Ms Saunders should be afforded the opportunity to respond in writing to\nthe dispensation application. Accordingly, Directions were issued by the Tribunal on 28\nApril 2018 which provided for the making of written representations by the parties (see,\nparagraph 13). The dispensation related to the above submission by Ms Saunders that, in\nview of the service of the section 20 notices on her by Park West RTM days after the date\nstated on them, she had been allowed less than the 30 day ‘relevant period’ provided for\nin the 2003 Regulations within which to respond to those notices. Without admitting this\nsubmission, Park West RTM sought dispensation in respect of the few days to which Ms\nSaunders had referred pursuant to section 20ZA of the 1985 Act.\n50 Mr Healey submitted a written statement on behalf of Ms Saunders in response to the\ndispensation application, which was dated 14 May 2018 and received by the Tribunal on\n16 May 2018. In this statement, Mr Healey made the following points. He reiterated the\ncircumstances pertaining to and perceived shortcomings in the service of each of the\n14\n\nsection 20 notices on Ms Saunders and stated that Ms Saunders ‘does not advance any\nargument that significant prejudice was suffered, or that she incurred a financial loss as\nresult of the failure to properly consult.’ Moreover, Mr Healey repeated that Ms Saunders\nhad indicated, previously, at the Hearing that she did not feel that she had suffered any\nprejudice as a result of the failure by Park West RTM to give sufficient time for the\nnotices to be received after posting. Consequently, Mr Healey opined that the\ndispensation application was neither inevitable nor absolutely necessary rather it was\nmade simply ‘for completeness’ and to protect Park West RTM’s position. Nevertheless,\nMr Healey informed the Tribunal that Ms Saunders did not resist the dispensation sought\nby Park West RTM. In these circumstances, however, Mr Healey submitted that any\ndispensation granted should be subject to the ‘reasonable’ condition that the Tribunal in\nmaking its determination in respect of the section 20C application finds that no costs\nincurred in relation to the dispensation application should be recoverable through the\nservice charge, or, otherwise, be so granted in the interests of fairness and justice.\n51 Park West RTM responded to the written representations submitted by Mr Healey on\nbehalf of Ms Saunders in respect of the dispensation application in a written statement of\nreply submitted by Mr Wayman on its behalf which was dated 21 May 2018 and received\nby the Tribunal on 22 May 2018. In that reply, Mr Wayman made a number of\nstatements. First, he stated that it was wholly unreasonable for Ms Saunders to put Park\nWest RTM to the cost of making the dispensation application, and, in particular, to the\ncost of dealing with extensive submissions, only to confirm that she did not resist the\napplication. Secondly, Ms Saunders had accepted as part of her application that no\nprejudice had been caused by the “short” notices served by Park West RTM. In light of\nthis, Mr Wayman considered that it was surprising, therefore, that this matter was\nregarded as an issue by Ms Saunders during Day 1 of the Hearing and that the Tribunal\nhad been invited to impose the statutory cap on recoverable service charge sums for the\nworks. This prompted Park West RTM to make the formal application for dispensation.\nMoreover, Mr Wayman added that on Day 2 of the Hearing, despite having considered\nthe original and updated skeleton arguments presented by Ms Cox, heard submissions by\nMs Cox dealing with the section 20ZA point, and having read the dispensation\napplication which set out Park West RTM’s position, Ms Saunders maintained her\nposition that the ‘”short notices” remained an issue. In these circumstances, Mr Wayman\nsuggested that a reasonable party should at the very least have consented to the\ndispensation application on Day 2 of the Hearing, which Ms Saunders chose not to do.\nConsequently, it was submitted by Mr Wayman that it was particularly inappropriate for\nPark West RTM to have to respond to Ms Saunders’ request that the granting of the\ndispensation application should be factored into the Tribunal’s determination of the\nsection 20C application and, moreover, that Park West RTM should be barred from\nputting the costs of the dispensation application through the service charge regime.\nMr Wayman described Ms Saunders’ conduct in respect of these matters as ‘risible’.\nManagement Fees\n52 In her witness statement, Ms Saunders indicated that during the section 20 consultation\nshe had expressed the view that the ‘pre and during work fees proposed by W & A were\nunreasonably high’ bearing in mind that the works comprised ‘a basic paint of the outside\nof the building’. Ms Saunders indicated that the breakdown of the management fees\nincluded items which she had not seen in other section 20 consultation exercises with\nwhich she had been involved, and, in her opinion, those project management fees were\ndisproportionate to the overall costs of the redecoration works undertaken. Ms Saunders\nalso expressed concern about the need for and, costs of, the Architect, health and welfare\nfacilities and the CDM-C co-ordinator. Ms Saunders re-iterated that other Park West\n15\n\nleaseholders had commented during the section 20 consultation on the high project\nmanagement fee.\nIn its statement of case, Park West RTM intimated that W & A had carried out a\nsignificant amount of work in fulfilling their management function, especially in their\nliaison with Building Transformation and in securing the completion of the works, and\ntime sheets had been provided to the Tribunal which gave an indication of the volume of\nwork undertaken by W & A in return for the project management fee. Further, in her\nskeleton argument, Ms Cox opined that Ms Saunders’ objection that the project\nmanagement fees charged by W & A, when aggregated, amounted to a relatively high\nproportion of the costs of the works was based on an overly simplistic approach. Ms Cox\nsaid that details of the work for which monies were required can be found in the second\nof the section 20 notices. She also alluded to an agreement between Park West RTM and\nW & A dated 1 April 2016 (‘2016 agreement’), which was presented in evidence by Mr\nTemporal as part of his supplemental witness statement, that provides for the payment of\nproject management fees to W & A in accordance with Schedule 2 to that agreement.\nMs Cox submitted that the costs relating to the appointment of the Architect, the\nprovision of the health and welfare facilities and the appointment of the CDM-C co-\nordinator were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount.\n(i) Pre-commencement Management Costs\n53 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders referred to these costs which were stated by W & A\nto relate to all tasks prior to the start of the works and which, according to the\nspecification, included meeting contractors on site, issuing notices to leaseholders and\ncontractors, liaising with suppliers and the CDM-C co-ordinator. In Ms Saunders’\nopinion, the works amounted to a re-paint of the outside of Park West which is required\n‘every so often’, and such an undertaking did not give rise to ‘out of the ordinary’ project\nmanagement tasks prior to the commencement of the works. Consequently, Ms Saunders\nsubmitted that the pre-commencement management costs of £32,798.61 were too high\nand unreasonable.\n54 In her skeleton argument, Ms Cox made the following points about the pre-\ncommencement management costs which had been incurred by Park West RTM. First,\nextensive pre-commencement work was required because the works related to a very\nlarge building. It was necessary to devise a cost-effective and safe strategy for carrying\nout the work and to prepare an appropriate schedule of works. During the planning\nprocess, it was clear that cleaning the render would neither suffice nor be efficient. As a\nconsequence, it was necessary to find out what finishes could be applied to the render\nand to take advice with a view to ensuring that any finish which was applied would have a\nreasonable lifespan. Advice was also required to take account of Park West’s location in a\nconservation area. Secondly, W & A have extensive experience of this type of project and\nanticipated, correctly, that the works would require ‘extensive input of their time’. Much\nof that time had been spent liaising with leaseholders, especially with those who were\nunable to pay their share of the costs immediately (payment plans were offered where\nnecessary). This was important because Park West RTM has no independent funds\nmaking it imperative that the costs of the works can be collected in full before the works\nproceed. Thirdly, the pre-commencement time that was spent in ensuring that the works\nwere carried out ‘in the best manner and for the best price’ meant that an additional\n£100,000.00 scaffolding cost was avoided. Park West RTM had adduced in evidence a\nquotation from Tubitt Scaffolding Ltd. dated 18 December 2014 for the supply, erection\nand design of independent scaffolding ‘for the purpose of giving access to all external\nelevations with a fully boarded scaffold and ladder access’ and scaffold for general\nrepairs. This quotation was for ‘£70,000 for a minimum period of 6 week/s or less and at\na rental of £5,500.00 per week or part of a week after the expiration of that period.’\n16\n\nIn view of the work undertaken, Ms Cox concluded that Park West will not require\nredecoration for ‘at least 5 more years’, and, further, the investigative and planning work\nwould not need to be repeated when Park West next requires redecoration.\n55 In his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal stated that a saving had been made\nwith respect to the pre-commencement management costs and referred to Exhibit 4\n(Budget vs Actual Paid) (‘Exhibit 4’) to that statement which shows that the saving\namounts to £8,650.18 (including VAT) as at 12 April 2018.\n56 Ms Cox submitted that it was wholly reasonable for Park West RTM to make the decision\nto expend the disputed sums in order to ensure that the works were ‘economical and\ncarried out as well as possible’ and that the sums were reasonable within the context of\nthe ‘unusual one-off’ nature of the planning required for the works.\n(ii) Project Management – Site Period\n57 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders outlined the activities that were stated by W & A to\nbe within the remit of project management during the site period. She stated that these\nincluded liaising with sub-contractors, suppliers and the CDM-C co-ordinator, producing\ndocumentation and monitoring the progress of the works, liaising with architects and\ncontractors, continued programming of works, daily site visits by the project manager,\nand cost control by a quantity surveyor. In addition, she pointed out that provision was\nmade for ‘all other administration costs required to complete the works’. Ms Saunders\nsubmitted that this description of the work to be carried out by way of project\nmanagement during the site period appeared to be a ‘catch-all list of tasks that anyone\ncould perform in major works and is not bespoke to what was actually required for this\nspecific project’. In her opinion, there was no need to employ a quantity surveyor to cost\ncontrol the work as it progressed or to liaise with suppliers and architects – these works\nwere without any ‘unusualness’. Ms Saunders also queried whether the charges which\nhad been agreed between Park West RTM and W & A satisfied the RICS Code of Practice\n(‘RICS Code’) to the extent that the contract between these parties did not provide, as\nenvisaged by the RICS Code, for a menu of charges for duties outside the scope of an\nannual fee.\n58 In respect of the fees charged for project managing these works, Ms Saunders suggested\nthat it is incumbent on the Tribunal to carefully consider ‘the constituent parts of the\ntotal fee (added to the cost of the works) in respect of what services were actually\nsupplied, who carried them out and whether the rate charged fell within the range of\nnormal market rates’ and relied upon the decision of the Upper Tribunal in London\nBorough of Lewisham v Luis Rey-Ordieres [2013] UKUT 14 (LC)). She submitted that a\n36% fee is well outside normal market rates for works of a ‘pretty standard nature’; a\nfigure of 0-10% would be more reasonable and in line with industry norms. At the\nHearing on 24 April 2018, Mr Healey, with the permission of the Tribunal, presented an\ne-mail sent to him on 24 April 2018 at his request by Thomas Hopson MA MRICS,\nAssociate Director, Encore Estate Management, Nottingham which set out, inter alia, the\nmanagement fees charged on a typical section 20 consultation project by four chartered\nbuilding surveying firms with whom Encore Estate Management had dealt. This showed a\npercentage range between 9.5% and 15% plus VAT, and, pertinently, for work value\nbetween £70,000.00 and £99,999.00, which encompassed all stages of a section 20\nconsultation project, that a 10% plus VAT project management fee was charged.\n59 In her skeleton argument, Ms Cox explained that the sums expended during the site\nperiod were required to ensure that the works were carried out properly and safely with\nthe result that Park West RTM was protected from the risk of poor workmanship and\nfrom adverse claims by contractors. This was usual practice, and, therefore, Ms Cox\n17\n\nsubmitted that it was perfectly reasonable to employ managers to oversee works carried\nout by contractors.\n60 Ms Cox also pointed out that evidence adduced by Park West RTM showed that W & A\nspent 73 hours in 2017 on work related to Park West, although, as intimated in its\nstatement of case, much work was carried out which was not recorded. She averred that\nthe failure of Building Transformation to carry out the works to the required standard\nobliged W & A to spend significant time ensuring that Building Transformation returned\nto Park West with a view to rectifying those matters which were unsatisfactory. In the\nevent, Ms Cox indicated that corrective work undertaken by Building Transformation was\nnot done to the satisfaction of W & A with the result that W & A took steps to ensure that\nthe works were completed to a reasonable standard.\n61 In relation to Ms Saunders’ contention that the sums expended were beyond market rates\nand that the market rate is 0-10%, Ms Cox stated that no evidence had been provided by\nMs Saunders in support of that contention, other than the e-mail from Tom Hopson of\nEncore State Management, Nottingham to Mr Healey dated 24 April 2018 to which Ms\nCox submitted little, if any, evidential weight should be given, because it was not\nindependent and, simply, a generic statement. In this instance, Ms Cox stated that the\nfigure charged for supervision of the works was approximately 12% of the cost of carrying\nout the works. She submitted that this is the market rate for the supervision of such\nworks and that, therefore, the amount charged is a reasonable figure.\n62 At the Hearing, Mr Healey described the 2016 agreement as a ‘unique arrangement’. He\nquestioned Mr Temporal about the charging arrangements for management fees under\nthat agreement and about the differences between those arrangements and the RICS\nCode and, also, how they differed to the benefit of W & A from the terms of an agreement\nnegotiated between Park West RTM and W & A in 2010, which had been adduced in\nevidence by Park West RTM. Mr Healey suggested that the charging arrangements in the\n2016 agreement were not in accordance with normal practice which, usually, allowed for\na fixed fee followed, thereafter, by a menu of charges. Mr Healey submitted that it was\npossible under the 2016 agreement for W & A to charge on an ad hoc basis once the fees\ncharged had passed beyond the fixed fee threshold provided for in the agreement.\nConsequently, Mr Healey observed it was not possible to have an idea of likely\nprospective costs. Mr Healey also queried, in view of Mr Walton’s appointment as a\ndirector of Park West RTM and his position in W & A, whether the 2016 agreement was\nconducted at arm’s length.\nMr Temporal informed the Tribunal that W & A managed approximately 40 blocks of\napartments and estates. He added that each management agreement was negotiated by\nW & A with a view to meeting the needs of particular clients and that the precise terms of\nthose agreements depended on the outcome of the negotiations.\nIn Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal reported that\n£12,300.00 (including VAT) had been paid as at 12 April 2018.\n(iii) Additional specific costs\n63 As indicated above (see, paragraph 24), Ms Saunders also challenged certain specific costs\nwhich W & A claimed were payable in addition to the contractor’s costs and for supplying\nother services, namely an Architect’s fee (£750.00), the cost of providing health and\nwelfare facilities whilst the works were undertaken (£4,231.25) and the cost of appointing\na CDM-C co-ordinator (£1,250.00). In each instance, the costs cited were exclusive of\nVAT.\n18\n\n(i) Architect’s Fee\n64 Ms Saunders challenged the appointment of an Architect to carry out an inspection,\nproduce a report and recommend appropriate finishes to be applied to Park West. In her\nopinion, there was no need to appoint an Architect as Park West was not a listed building\nand the works did not involve any element of redesign. Ms Saunders submitted that the\ncost incurred (£750.00) was unreasonable, because it was unnecessary to employ an\nArchitect to ‘report on the finishes’.\n65 Ms Cox stated in her skeleton argument that this was a small sum of money which was\nrequired, first, in order to comply with the requirements of the local conservation area,\nand, secondly, because of the difficulty of finding an appropriate paint to coat the render.\nMs Cox referred to examples of other pertinent work carried out by the Architect, and to\nexplanations which had been given to leaseholders during the section 20 consultation\nabout the necessity for the Architect’s work both of which had been adduced in evidence.\nMs Cox explained that once it had been concluded that cleaning of the render was\ninsufficient, it was necessary to ascertain what finish could be applied and how well it\nwould last in order to avoid further costs in the future. She also pointed out that the\nconsequent inexpensive outgoing in obtaining this information was intended to save\nfuture costs by providing a lasting finish, and added that such an exercise would not need\nto be repeated when Park West is next decorated.\nMs Cox asserted that Ms Saunders had failed to provide any evidence to suggest that the\ninformation gleaned from the Architect’s work could have been obtained more cheaply\nelsewhere, or that such work was inherently unreasonable. Ms Cox submitted that this\ncost was reasonably incurred and was reasonable in amount.\nAt the Hearing, Mr Healey reiterated Ms Saunders’ challenge to the appointment of an\nArchitect to carry out the specified tasks. In his oral evidence to the Tribunal, Mr\nTemporal elaborated upon the Architect’s role and pointed out, as had been explained by\nMs Cox, that, in particular, the Architect had been involved, with Mr Stevenson, W & A’s\nConstruction and Maintenance Director, in the determination that cleaning of the render\nwas insufficient, the resolution after investigative work of which paint was to be used on\nthe render, and, further, with the provision of advice about a third quotation which had\nbeen received for the works and which, in view of its cost, was not pursued.\nIn Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal reported that £972.00\n(including VAT) had been paid as at 12 April 2018.\n(ii) Health and Welfare facilities\n66 In furtherance of the question raised in her Application about the reasonableness of the\nsum expended for the provision of a secure welfare unit during the currency of the works,\nMs Saunders in her statement of case queried the legislative basis upon which the\nexpenditure incurred in providing the welfare facility, £4,231.25, could be justified\nbearing in mind the nature of the works undertaken. Further, Ms Saunders stated she\nhad spoken to other owners and that no welfare unit(s) had been seen by them during the\nworks. In her oral evidence during the Hearing, Ms Saunders said that she had driven\npast Park West, frequently, during the carrying out of the works, but she had not seen a\nwelfare unit in the vicinity of Elliott Street as provided for in the description of the works.\nMs Saunders requested Park West RTM to provide evidence of the expenditure incurred\nin providing the welfare unit and asserted that the costs incurred were too high. In her\nopinion, Park West RTM should have obtained at least one other quote. At the Hearing,\nMr Healey suggested to the Tribunal that, in his experience, the cost of providing this\nfacility should have been £2,000.00 (plus VAT).\n19\n\n67 Ms Cox informed the Tribunal that the provision of the welfare facilities was explained in\nthe third notice that had been served on leaseholders in fulfilment of the section 20\nconsultation requirements which had notified leaseholders that the contract for the works\nhad been awarded to Building Transformation; an explanation which indicated that the\nwelfare facilities would be provided by W & A in view of their liability for health and\nwelfare on the site during the works. Ms Cox also explained that the facilities were\nrequired in order to satisfy Regulation 13(3)(c) of and Schedule 2 to the Construction\n(Design and Management) Regulations 2015. Moreover, as stated in Park West’s\nstatement of case, the welfare facilities were situated in Elliott Street and adjacent to Park\nWest during the works. Ms Cox referred the Tribunal to an invoice dated 2 November\n2016 in which the welfare facilities were described submitted to Park West RTM by W &\nA.\n68 Mr Temporal presented a colour photograph taken from Google Maps and dated\nSeptember 2016, which showed several welfare units in the designated area in Elliott\nStreet, as Exhibit 11 to his supplemental witness statement.\n69 In these circumstances, Ms Cox stated that Park West RTM refuted the unsupported\nassertion that no welfare unit had been in place in Elliott Street and adjacent to Park\nWest. Similarly, Ms Cox rejected the suggestion by Ms Saunders that the cost of providing\nthis facility was ‘too high’ and that another quote should have been sought. In this\nrespect, Ms Cox observed that Ms Saunders had failed to provide any quote upon which\nthe Tribunal might rely in order to consider whether the cost incurred was too high.\nFurther, Ms Cox submitted that since the works were scheduled to take between 8 and 9\nweeks (whereas, as Mr Temporal had shown in his evidence, they in fact took longer) the\nsum disputed by Ms Saunders amounts to just over £500.00 per week, which is a\nreasonable figure for the provision of such facilities.\n70 In Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal reported that\n£5,332.50 (including VAT) had been paid as at 12 April 2018.\n(iii) CDM-C co-ordinator\n71 In her witness statement, Ms Saunders stated that she had queried why a CDM-C co-\nordinator was required for ‘this small job as I thought the cost was unnecessary’. Further,\nMs Saunders intimated that during the section 20 consultation process, another\nleaseholder had questioned whether there was a legal obligation to appoint a CDM-C co-\nordinator for the works in that the works were not notifiable to the Health and Safety\nExecutive (HSE) and in light of the CDM Regulations 2015, which came into force on 6\nApril 2015, and which do not include a role entitled CDM-C co-ordinator. Further, Ms\nSaunders was not satisfied with the response from W & A to this question which, first,\naccepted that, although there was no requirement to appoint a CDM-C co-ordinator in\nthe sense that the works were not notifiable to the HSE, advice from a CDM-C co-\nordinator was still needed to comply with all health and safety issues, and, secondly,\nacknowledged the change introduced by the CDM Regulations 2015 and added ‘because\nof this we instructed the services of our approved CDM-C person before this change took\nplace and they can act on our behalf until October 2015…there will still be a role for\nCDM-C after that date but they would have to be employed by the Client or form part of\nthe Architect’s role.’\n72 Additionally, in her statement of case, Ms Saunders alluded to the costs of W & A in\nmanaging the works during the pre-commencement and site periods. This management\nincluded the use of a project manager, a quantity surveyor, a planner/programmer, and\nother administrative staff who, Ms Saunders suggested, might ‘undertake a risk\nassessment and then manage that assessment throughout the entirety of the works’ which\n20\n\nwould render the appointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator unnecessary. Ms Saunders\nrequired Park West RTM to provide documentary evidence of the appointment of the\nCDM-C co-ordinator for the works and strict proof of expenditure incurred.\n73 In these circumstances, Ms Saunders asserted that the charge made in respect of the\nappointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator was an unreasonable cost. It was a duplication of\nthe fees levied by W & A to manage the works which, Ms Saunders contended, covered\nhealth and safety matters.\n74 Ms Cox indicated that, as with the provision of the welfare facilities, the appointment of a\nCDM-C co-ordinator was explained in the third notice that had been served on\nleaseholders in fulfilment of the section 20 consultation requirements. Further, Ms Cox\nexplained that the employment of the expert services of an external CDM-C co-ordinator,\nBCA Project Services, was prompted by W & A’s liability for health and welfare on the site\nand with a view, broadly, to advising W & A on any issues arising on site during the works\nand in order to ensure that W & A were working correctly and in line with HSE\nguidelines. She added that it was necessary to pay particular attention to health and\nsafety requirements because, in order to save significant costs, it had been decided to\nadopt a more dangerous methodology for carrying out the works i.e. working by abseiling\nrather than from scaffolding. Ms Cox also highlighted that BCA Project Services prepared\na schedule of services relating to its role as the CDM-C co-ordinator under the CDM\nRegulations 2007 and, thereafter, wrote a pre-construction report dated September 2016\ncontaining health and safety information relating to the redecoration of the external\nelevations of Park West. In its statement of case, Park West RTM submitted that the costs\nso incurred, £1,250.00, were reasonably incurred and that the resultant value gained by\nMs Saunders was clearly identifiable.\n75 At the Hearing, Mr Healey stated that there was no formal requirement to appoint a\nCDM-C co-ordinator and, consequently, the Tribunal should not entertain the costs of\n£1,250.00 in relation to that appointment. He added that the pre-construction report\nserved no purpose as it was not specific to Park West and could be used for any project.\nIn his oral evidence, Mr Temporal indicated that, as Ms Cox had explained, the manner\nin which the works were carried out i.e. through abseiling necessarily involved significant\nattention to health and safety. He stated that the CDM-C co-ordinator was needed to\nassess and to advise upon those risks and that the appointment had been made in the\nbest interests of the leaseholders. Further, in Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness\nstatement, Mr Temporal reported that £750.00 (including VAT) had been paid as at 12\nApril 2018.\nDispute 2\n76 The following paragraphs (77-83) summarise the submissions of the parties relating to\nissues concerning the works undertaken and the standard of those works.\nThe Works – reasonable standard\n77 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders made a number of statements about the works,\nnamely that those works were stopped half way through, had not been completed and\nwere not of a reasonable standard. She stated that prior to the Application and over a\nlengthy period of time, she had sought and been unable to ascertain from W & A and/or\ntheir solicitors information about why the works had apparently stopped, save that a\nletter from W & A which accompanied the March 2017 service charge demand indicated\nthat there were ‘concerns about the standard of work’ and that a sum of £10,000.00 was\nrequired to cover legal action against Building Transformation. In these circumstances,\nMs Saunders felt it was necessary for Park West RTM to ‘fully explain’ the exact nature of\nthe dispute between itself and Building Transformation (together with the status of any\n21\n\nlitigation) and with regard to the works to indicate whether plans were in place to\ncomplete the works and when, how much has been spent and if any consultation is to be\nundertaken with a view to the completion of the works.\n78 For Park West RTM, Ms Cox stated that prior to 2016 Park West had not been\nredecorated since it was developed in 2003; a statement which was endorsed by Mr\nTemporal. Further, Ms Cox indicated that the external render and window frames had\nbeen dirty and in need of decoration and minor repair, and it did not appear that Ms\nSaunders disputed that the works were necessary.\n79 In its statement of case, Park West RTM ‘advised’ Ms Saunders that Building\nTransformation ‘did not carry out the works to the reasonable satisfaction of the\nRespondent. The Respondent’s managing agent carried out a considerable amount of\nwork in making suitable representations to Building Transformation who did return to\nthe development on numerous occasions in order to remedy the works. Ultimately, the\nRespondent’s managing agent stepped in to complete the final aspects of the works.’\nConsequently, Ms Cox stated that Ms Saunders’ submission that the works had not been\ncompleted was misconceived and that the works were completed on or around 25 July\n2017 – the final element of those works related to the timber cladding in the courtyard of\nPark West. In his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal recorded that Pamela\nBrangan, a Director of Park West RTM, had signed off the works by telephone.\nIn his evidence, Mr Temporal also explained that the dissatisfaction with the quality of\nwork undertaken by Building Transformation and the ensuing dispute between Park\nWest RTM and Building Transformation led Park West RTM to instruct solicitors,\nFreeths LLP, a firm which he believed specialised in construction law, to seek legal\nredress against Building Transformation. Mr Temporal informed the Tribunal that, in the\ncourse of the dispute, Building Transformation commissioned an expert report on the\nstandard of its workmanship at Park West which was written by Bidwells LLP and was\ndated 26 April 2017. Mr Temporal appended this report to his supplemental witness\nstatement as Exhibit 13. Mr Temporal indicated that whilst this report was not accepted\nin its entirety by Park West RTM it was instrumental in settling the dispute between the\nparties. He described the manner in which the dispute was resolved as follows:\n‘…a settlement agreement had been entered into whereby Building Transformations\nwould carry out further restorative works in return for their outstanding fees. As it\nbecame clear to the Respondent that these restorative works would not be completed to\nthe reasonable satisfaction of the Respondent, Building Transformations were excused\nfrom their responsibilities under the settlement agreement in return for a lower fee.’\nMr Temporal also appended a number of photographs in various exhibits (6–9) to his\nsupplemental witness statement which showed, respectively, the exterior of Park West\nprior to the commencement of the works, signs of the issues that were becoming\napparent with regard to the quality of the works carried out by Building Transformation\n(taken on 25 October 2016), evidence of the snagging process and, hence, evidence of the\nquality of the work undertaken (taken on 4 November 2016, 8 November 2016 and 14\nNovember 2016) and the two final sessions of snagging (taken on 20 February 2017 and 1\nMarch 2017). He was uncertain of the exact date upon which Building Transformation\nceased working at Park West, but, as he had intimated, the last snagging session had been\non 1 March 2017.\nIn Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal reported that the\nbudgeted contractor cost of the works (£81,254.69 + VAT) for Park West was reduced by\n£24,003.75 (including VAT) as a result of the resolution of the dispute with Building\nTransformation relating to the standard of the works. He also informed the Tribunal that\nthe legal costs referred to by Ms Saunders in her statement of case comprised the legal\n22\n\nfees payable by Park West RTM to Freeths LLP for legal services rendered in relation to\nthis dispute and added that there were associated costs incurred by W & A. These fees\nand costs were referred to in Exhibit 4 and comprised £11,998.72 (including VAT) and\n£23,650.00 (including VAT) respectively as at 12 April 2018.\n80 In his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal also informed the Tribunal that the\nfollowing adjustments had been made to the budgeted costs of the works – an additional\ncost of £1,622.28 (plus VAT; £1,946.74) for a gutter safe system, and deductions of\n£600.00 (plus VAT; £720.00) and £375.00 (plus VAT; £450.00) for the area not painted\non the Hermon Street elevation of Park West and for cleaning paint off an Audi car\nrespectively.\n81 Further, Mr Temporal referred the Tribunal to an independent building survey relating to\nthe condition and state of repair of Park West which had been commissioned by W & A\nfollowing the completion of the works. Mr Temporal indicated that this report which was\nwritten by Cloud Surveyors and dated 1 February 2018 was appended to his initial\nwitness statement. Mr Temporal said that the forward maintenance plan for Park West\ncontained in Appendix 1 of the report and covering the period 2018-2022 showed that\nonly £300.00 had been allowed for external redecoration of Park West over that 5 year\nperiod. From this, Mr Temporal stated in his initial witness statement that it was\nreasonable to assume that the works had been completed to a reasonable standard\nalthough it was accepted that some paint splashes remained. However, Mr Temporal\npointed out that Cloud Surveyors had ‘highlighted to the Respondent that if you wanted\nto clean all the paint splashes off you would need to erect scaffolding which would not be\na viable option or a good use of the service charge.’\n82 Ms Cox submitted that the works had been completed properly and to a reasonable\nstandard and that the complaint about the works made by Ms Saunders was without\nfoundation or proper explanation. Ms Cox noted that Ms Saunders is not personally\nresident at Park West and suggested that it was not apparent from Ms Saunders’ evidence\nthat she had actually seen the works at any time. Moreover, Ms Cox observed that Ms\nSaunders had not submitted any independent evidence as to the standard of the works or\nany proposal as to the amount that she would consider appropriate to pay for the work\nwhich has been done.\n83 At the Hearing, Mr Healey said that there were doubts about whether the render should\nhave been painted, but, assuming that painting was an appropriate option, the\nspecification for the works was defective. In his opinion, two coats of paint were\ninadequate to achieve the required standard which was borne out in the report written by\nBidwells LLP that also questioned the use of abseiling to carry out the painting. As to the\nstandard of the work undertaken, Mr Healey made the following points. First, the poor\nstandard of the work undertaken was evident on inspection. Secondly, no preparatory\nworks were undertaken and the paint had apparently been applied to the external render\nof Park West in a random and uneven manner leaving an unsatisfactory outcome which\nwas particularly evident from the different coats of paints which had been applied to the\nIlkeston Road elevation of Park West leaving different shaded strips. Thirdly, there were\nalso many paint splashes remaining of which the splashes on Ms Babadi’s balcony, which\nwere observed by the Tribunal during its inspection, by way of example.\nMr Healey also questioned the involvement of W & A in carrying out remedial work on\nsite with a view to rectifying perceived defects in Building Transformation’s work. In his\nopinion, such work did not fall within their remit of managing the works during the site\nperiod.\n23\n\n2002 Act application\n84 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders objected to two charges, each of £6o.00, which\nhad been included in her service charge account in 2017. In that account, these were\ndescribed as ‘late payment admin fees’. Ms Saunders argued that these fees were unfair\nbecause they were levied at a time when she was awaiting a response from W & A and\ntheir solicitors as to complaints which she had made in relation to the section 20\nconsultation.\n85 Ms Cox made a number of points in response to this objection. First, the only ‘late\npayment’ fees which had been imposed were not applied in the service charge year (April\n2016 – March 2017) which was in issue within the Application. In fact, the first of these\nfees was included in Ms Saunders’ statement of account in June 2017. Consequently, they\nwere not relevant to these proceedings. Secondly, the sums in dispute between the parties\namount to only £1,872.69. However, it is clear from her statement of account that Ms\nSaunders also has significant further arrears in relation to which she has made no express\ncomplaint. In this respect, Ms Cox averred that even if Ms Saunders is entitled to\nwithhold payment of the sums subject to the dispute, she is not entitled to withhold sums\nin relation to which she has no proper objection. This adversely affects other leaseholders\nand Park West RTM whose only source of income is the service charge. Thirdly, Ms\nSaunders is obliged to pay such fees in accordance with clause 3.1 and paragraph 2(b) of\nthe Third Schedule to the lease (see, paragraph 18) and the wording on service charge\ndemands sent to Ms Saunders indicates that such sums may be charged. Finally, the fee\ncharged must be reasonable. Ms Cox opined that this test is satisfied when account is\ntaken of the costs incurred in pursuing late payments and the knock-on effects for other\nleaseholders. Ms Cox also observed that the sum charged is small in comparison to the\namounts owed by Ms Saunders in service charge arrears.\nSection 20C application\n86 Mr Healey indicated that Ms Saunders had been prompted to make her application to the\nTribunal for an order under section 20C, primarily, because over a lengthy period of time,\nexceeding 12 months, she had been unable to secure information from either W & A or\ntheir solicitors (to whom she had been directed) about, in particular, various aspects of\nthe works, for example, why the works had stopped, and the dispute relating to those\nworks and its related costs. Mr Healey said that this lack of communication was\nevidenced in November 2017 when Ms Saunders was informed by the solicitors that ‘we\nare unable to get a meaningful response from our client, so we have cancelled our legal\nfees charged to you and closed the case’. Mr Healey added that Ms Saunders also believed\nthat it was only right that the (unexplained) high project management fees be challenged.\nHe submitted that, in these circumstances, it was not just and equitable that the costs\nincurred by Park West RTM in connection with the proceedings before the Tribunal\nshould fall to be paid by leaseholders through the service charge. Similarly, it was not just\nand equitable, in his opinion, for costs incurred by Park West RTM in connection with\nthe dispensation application, which ‘was not inevitable or absolutely necessary and to\nprotect the landlord’s position’ and, in the event, was not resisted by Ms Saunders, to be\nborne by leaseholders through the service charge (see also, paragraph 50).\n87 Ms Saunders’ Application was described in various ways by Park West RTM and its\nrepresentatives. In its statement of case, Park West RTM considered that the Application\nhad been completed in a scattergun manner. Ms Cox, in her skeleton argument and\nduring the Hearing, referred to the Application as ‘vague and ill-founded’ and ‘nebulous\nand non-specific’ and one in respect of which Park West RTM had been obliged to spend\nmonies. Further, Ms Cox added that Ms Saunders’ complaints about lack of information\nhad been met by the content of the Hearing bundle submitted on behalf of Park West\nRTM, and, consequently, in Ms Cox’s opinion, these proceedings need not have been\n24\n\npursued. Ms Cox observed that Ms Saunders’ only apparent objection to the costs of the\nproceedings being recovered, if necessary, through the service charge was that she did not\nwish the leaseholders to pay them. However, Ms Cox stated that the leaseholders will\nhave to pay in any event as Park West RTM is an RTM company with the prospect, in the\nabsence of recovery, that it will be insolvent. In the circumstances and bearing in mind\nthat Ms Saunders brought matters before the Tribunal without any proper evidence,\nespecially evidence as to ‘reasonableness’, Ms Cox submitted that it would be\ninappropriate to deprive Park West RTM of its contractual right to recover its costs in\nrelation to these proceedings through the service charge provisions in the lease.\nIn reply to Ms Saunders’ response to the dispensation application, Mr Wayman\nconsidered it to be wholly unreasonable to put Park West RTM to the cost of making that\napplication only for Ms Saunders to confirm in her written representations in response to\nthat application that it would not be resisted. Moreover, Mr Wayman asserted that it was\nan application, which on the basis of the initial evidence given by Ms Saunders that she\nwas not prejudiced by the section 20 notices being ‘short’ and the evidence available to\nMs Saunders on the second day of the Hearing, should ‘at the very least have been\nconsented to’ by Ms Saunders. In these circumstances, Mr Wayman stated that there\nwere no grounds for Ms Saunders’ submission that Park West RTM’s costs associated\nwith making the dispensation application should not be recovered from the leaseholders\nthrough the service charge regime (see also, paragraph 51).\nIn this reply and on the advice of Ms Cox, Mr Wayman also drew the Tribunal’s attention\nto a ‘serious matter’ of which he was informed immediately following Day 2 of the\nHearing and which he regarded as germane to Ms Saunders’ section 20C application,\nnamely an e-mail which Mr Healey had written directly to Pamela Brangan on the eve of\nDay 2 of the Hearing. At this time, Mr Wayman stated that there was no reason for Mr\nHealey to believe that LMP Law Limited was no longer acting for Park West RTM.\nConsequently, Mr Wayman contended that if Mr Healey wished to address any question\nwhatsoever to Park West RTM he should have directed that question to LMP Law\nLimited. Mr Wayman added that had LMP Law Limited been aware of this ‘serious\ntransgression’ before Day 2 of the Hearing Ms Cox would have referred to it as part of her\nsubmissions concerning the section 20C application.\nDetermination\nIntroduction\n88 In making its determination, the Tribunal considered, carefully, the oral and written\nevidence presented by the parties.\n89 The issues raised in the Application are considered and determined in the order in which\nthe evidence submitted by the parties has been presented in this decision, namely the\nsection 27A application, the 2002 Act application and the section 20C application. With\nregard to the former, the Tribunal, in the absence of a case being made by Ms Saunders in\nher written or oral evidence upon which the Tribunal might make a finding, makes no\ndetermination in relation to questions c. and d. in the Application (see, paragraph 24).\nFurther, the Tribunal makes no finding as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the legal\nfees incurred in connection with the settlement of the dispute with Building\nTransformation. In this respect, whilst the Tribunal acknowledges that these legal fees\nwere one of the catalysts for the Application and that, at the request of Ms Saunders in\nher statement of case, information pertaining to those costs was provided at the Hearing,\nit considers that neither of these factors brings those costs within the remit of the present\nApplication. It follows that the Tribunal also makes no finding as to the related costs of W\n& A.\n25\n\nSection 27A application\nSection 20 consultation\n90 The essence and purpose of a section 20 consultation is encompassed in the following\nwords of Lord Justice Lewison in The London Borough of Hounslow v Waaler [2017]\nEWCA Civ 45 (‘Waaler’):\n“ [38]…before carrying out works of any size the landlord is obliged to comply with\nconsultation requirements; and the current requirements are those contained in the\nService Charges (Consultation Requirements) (England) Regulations 2003. The landlord\nmust…describe the works proposed to be carried out, and under each of the Schedules to\nthose regulations the landlord must “have regard” to the lessees’ observations on his\nproposals. The obligation to consult goes to the appropriateness of the works proposed by\nthe landlord: Daejan at [43]. Although the duty to consult in this context is not a public\nlaw duty imposed on the landlord (see Daejan at [52]) nevertheless the concept of what\namounts to consultation is well developed in public law (see for example R v North and\nEst Devon Health Authority, ex p Coughlan [2001] QB 213). What this means is that the\nlandlord must conscientiously consider the lessees’ observations and give them due\nweight, depending on the nature and cogency of the observations. In the light of this\nstatutory obligation to consult, it is impossible to say that the tenants’ views are ever\nimmaterial. They will have to be considered in every case. This does not of course mean\nthe lessees have any kind of veto over what the landlord does; nor that they are entitled to\ninsist upon the cheapest possible means of fulfilling the landlord’s objective. But a duty to\nconsult and to “have regard” to the lessees’ observations entails more than simply telling\nthem what is going to happen. Given that in every case the tenants will have had the\nopportunity to make observations on the landlord’s proposals I do not consider that the\nlandlord has any further positive duty to inquire into the tenants’ views. The statutory\nconsultation process is designed to inform the landlord about the tenants’ views.\n[39] Once the landlord has consulted the tenants and taken their observations into\naccount, it is then for the landlord to make the final decision. In considering whether the\nfinal decision is a reasonable one, the tribunal must accord the landlord what, in other\ncontexts, is described as a “margin of appreciation”. As I have said there may be a\nnumber of outcomes, each of which is reasonable, and it is for the landlord to choose\nbetween them.”\n91 Should it be contended that the consultation requirements have been breached, an\napplication for dispensation under section 20ZA of the 1985 Act may be made. The\nproper approach for the Tribunal to take when considering such an application is set out\nin the Supreme Court’s judgment in Daejan. In summary, the approach to be adopted is\nas follows:\na. The Tribunal should identify the extent to which tenants would be prejudiced in\neither paying for inappropriate works or paying more than would be appropriate\nas a result of the failure by the landlord to comply with the consultation\nrequirements;\nb. That no distinction should be drawn between ‘a serious failure’ and ‘technical\nerror or minor or excusable oversight’ on the landlord’s part save in relation to the\nprejudice it causes;\nc. The financial consequences to the landlord of not granting a dispensation are not\nrelevant factors when the Tribunal is considering how to exercise its jurisdiction\nunder section 20ZA; and\n26\n\nd. The nature of the landlord is not relevant.\n92 In the light of this guidance from the Supreme Court, the primary question for the\nTribunal is to consider whether there is real prejudice to the tenant arising from a\nlandlord’s breach of the consultation requirements. In this respect, there is a factual\nburden on the tenant to identify some prejudice, which is financial, that would or might\nhave been suffered as a result of the landlord’s failure to properly consult.\n93 The Tribunal may grant dispensation on such terms and subject to such conditions as it\nthinks fit, but any such terms and conditions must be appropriate in their nature and\neffect.\n94 Ms Saunders raised two issues in relation to the manner in which the section 20\nconsultation was conducted, namely the service of the section 20 notices which she\nsubmitted did not comply with the requirement to allow a 30 day consultation period and\nthe failure by W & A to include in its written response to matters raised by leaseholders\nduring the consultation the observations which she said that she had made in a letter sent\nby post pursuant to the second section 20 notice and within the designated consultation\nperiod. In respect of each of these issues, the evidence presented to the Tribunal by the\nparties was conflicting and, to a degree, incomplete. As to the ‘short notices’, Ms\nSaunders stated, particularly, that the notices in respect of which a leaseholder response\ncould be made arrived on days that fell within the required 30 day consultation period\nwithin which such responses might be submitted. This was denied by Park West RTM\nalthough no evidence was adduced as to proof of posting of the notices, for example, a\ncertificate of posting. Nevertheless, Mr Temporal in his evidence made it clear that,\nregardless of the length of the consultation period, submissions made by leaseholders\nthat were received after the closing date of that period were considered. Similarly,\ndisparities were evident in the positions taken by the parties with regard to the letter\nwhich Ms Saunders stated that she had sent to W & A in response to the second section\n20 notice. In this respect, Ms Saunders relied upon her recollection of the contents of her\nletter as she had not retained a copy of it. Park West RTM denied that this letter had been\nreceived and, consequently, it had not been possible to acknowledge it in W & A’s written\ncomments about matters raised by leaseholders. However, it pointed out that the matters\nwhich Ms Saunders said that she had included in her letter had been raised by other\nleaseholders and these were covered in W & A’s written comments on those matters.\nIn addition to the contrasting stances adopted by the parties on these issues, there was\nalso what might be described as a certain ambiguity in Ms Saunders’ evidence in that,\nwhilst raising these issues in her written evidence and persisting with them in her oral\nevidence on Day 1 of the Hearing, she accepted that she had not suffered any prejudice,\nmost explicitly in relation to the ‘short notices’. This persistence would appear to have\nprompted Park West RTM to make its formal dispensation application which, in due\ncourse, Ms Saunders did not resist.\nIn these circumstances, it is difficult for the Tribunal to make conclusive findings on\neither of the issues raised by Ms Saunders in relation to the propriety or otherwise of the\nsection 20 consultation. Although, the Tribunal notes, in passing, that it would appear\nthat W & A dealt diligently with those leaseholders’ observations covered by its written\ncomments and that these comments addressed matters which Ms Saunders believes that\nshe raised in her letter.\nHowever, it is also fair to say that even if Ms Saunders’ representations as to what she\nperceived as flaws in that consultation are conceivable her admissions that she did not\nsuffer any consequent prejudice, a conclusion with which assuming the existence of such\n27\n\nflaws the Tribunal would have no reason to disagree, made her ultimate decision not to\nresist the dispensation application a matter of little doubt.\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines, in so far as it can, that, in the absence of prejudice,\ndispensation as specified in the dispensation application from the consultation\nrequirements of section 20 would be in order.\nThe Tribunal returns to the dispensation application in the context of the section 20C\napplication in paragraph 119 of this decision.\n95 On the assumption that the section 20 consultation is treated as completed for the\npurposes of this Application, the Tribunal makes the following findings in respect of the\nsubstantive issues raised in the section 27A application.\nThe payability and reasonableness of service charges\n96 The above cited sections 18, 19 and 27A of the 1985 Act (see, paragraphs 33-34) contain\nimportant statutory provisions relating to the recovery of service charges in residential\nleases. In the ordinary course of events, payment of these charges is governed by the\nterms of the lease which set out the agreement that has been entered into by the parties\nto the lease. However, these provisions in the 1985 Act provide additional protection to\ntenants in this instance, broadly, through the application of a test of ‘reasonableness’.\n97 In these respects, the construction of a lease is a matter of law whereas the\n‘reasonableness’ of the service charge for the purposes of the 1985 Act is a matter of fact.\nIt is accepted that there is no presumption either way in deciding the ‘reasonableness’ of\na service charge. If a tenant provides evidence which establishes a prima facie case for a\nchallenge, the onus is on the landlord to counter that evidence. Consequently, a decision\nis reached on the strength of the arguments made by the parties. Essentially, the Tribunal\ndecides ‘reasonableness’ on the evidence which has been presented to it (Yorkbrook\nInvestments Ltd v Batten [1985] 2 EGLR 100).\n98 With regard to the test of establishing whether a cost was reasonably incurred, the usual\nstarting point, and one that was adopted by Ms Cox, is the Lands Tribunal decision in\nForcelux Limited v Sweetman [2001] 2 EGLR 173 (‘Forcelux’), which concerned the\nrecovery of insurance premiums through a service charge, in which Mr PR Francis FRICS\nsaid:\n“[39]…The question I have to answer is not whether the expenditure for any particular\nservice charge item was necessarily the cheapest available, but whether the charge that\nwas made was reasonably incurred.\n[40] But to answer that question, there are in my judgment, two distinctly separate\nmatters I have to consider. First, the evidence, and from that whether the landlord’s\nactions were appropriate and properly effected in accordance with the requirements of\nthe lease, the RICS Code and the 1985 Act. Second, whether the amount charged was\nreasonable in light of that evidence. This second point is particularly important as, if that\ndid not have to be considered, it would be open to any landlord to plead justification for\nany particular figure, on the grounds that the steps it took justified the expense, without\nproperly testing the market.”\n99 Subsequently, in the Lands Tribunal decision in Veena v Cheong [2003] 1 EGLR 175, Mr\nPH Clarke FRICS observed:\n28\n\n“[103]…The question is not solely whether costs are ‘reasonable’ but whether they are\n‘reasonably incurred’, that is to say whether the action taken in incurring the costs and\nthe amount of those costs were both reasonable.”\n100 Recently, the Court of Appeal analysed the concept of ‘reasonably incurred’ in section\n19(1) of the 1985 Act in Waaler in the course of considering whether the cost of replacing\nwindows by Hounslow was reasonable where those windows could have been repaired at\na cost that was substantially less than the cost of replacing the windows. The court said\nthat in applying the test of establishing whether a cost was reasonably incurred the\nlandlord’s decision making process is not ‘the only touchstone’. A landlord must do more\nthan act rationally in making decisions, otherwise section 19 would serve no useful\npurpose. It is particularly important that the outcome of the decision making process is\nconsidered. As HHJ Stuart Bridge said in the later Upper Tribunal decision in Cos\nServices Limited v Nicholson and Willans [2017] UKUT 382 (LC):\n“[47] If, in determining whether a cost has been ‘reasonably incurred’, a tribunal is\nrestricted to an examination of whether the landlord has acted rationally, section 19 will\nhave little or no impact for the reasons identified by the Court of Appeal in Waaler. I\nagree with the Court of Appeal that this cannot be the intention of Parliament when it\nenacted section 19 as it would add nothing to the protection of the tenant that existed\npreviously. It must follow that the tribunal is required to go beyond the issue of the\nrationality of the landlord’s decision-making and to consider in addition whether the sum\nbeing charged is, in all the circumstances, a reasonable charge. It is, as the Lands\nTribunal identified in Forcelux, necessarily a two-stage test.\n[48] Context is, as always, everything, and every decision will be based upon its own\nfacts…”\n101 In approaching the question of the ‘reasonableness’ of the contested costs within the\nservice charge in this Application, the Tribunal is also mindful of the Upper Tribunal\ndecision in Regent Management Limited v Jones [2010] UKUT 369 (LC) to which Ms\nCox also referred, and, in particular, to the following cautionary words of HHJ Mole QC:\n“[35] The test is whether the service charge that was made was a reasonable one; not\nwhether there are other possible ways of charging that might have been thought better or\nmore reasonable. There may be several different ways of dealing with a particular\nproblem… All of them may be perfectly reasonable. Each may have its own advantages\nand disadvantages. Some people may favour one set of advantages and disadvantages,\nothers another. The LVT may have its own view. If the choice had been left to the LVT, it\nmight not have chosen what the management company chose but that does not\nnecessarily make what the management company chose unreasonable.”\n102 In the light of this judicial guidance, the Tribunal’s discussion and findings in respect of\neach of the contested matters follows.\nManagement fees – surveying and project management\n103 At the outset, the Tribunal notes that each of the parties accepted that it was necessary to\nemploy professionals to undertake the project management and oversight of the works,\nalthough Ms Saunders expressed the following reservations about aspects of the\nfulfilment of this role by W & A. First, the 2016 agreement between Park West RTM and\nW & A was not negotiated at arm’s length bearing in mind the roles which Mr Walton\nplays in relation to Park West RTM and W & A respectively. Secondly, the 2016\nagreement differed materially from the earlier 2010 agreement entered into by Park West\nRTM and W & A to the benefit of W & A. Thirdly, the 2016 agreement did not follow the\n29\n\nguidance offered in the RICS Code relating to additional charges leading to the\nemployment of ad hoc charging.\n104 Further, it was also evident to the Tribunal that, whilst the evidence presented by Ms\nSaunders or on her behalf proceeded on the basis of a differentiation between the project\nmanagement fee relating to the pre-commencement of the works and the project\nmanagement fee covering the period during which the works were undertaken (the site\nperiod), her challenge was to the reasonableness of the totality of those fees. In essence,\nMs Saunders argued that the project management fee charged for the works did not\naccord with the ‘industry standard’ for this type of project which requires the application\nof a suitable percentage to the costs for the works in order to ascertain the fee that is\npayable. In this respect, as the evidence shows, various representations were made by Ms\nSaunders and Mr Healey about the range of percentages that may be apposite depending\non the cost of the works – Ms Saunders suggested between 0-10% in the Application\nwhilst Mr Healey favoured between 9.5-15% (with 10% applying in cases where the cost of\nthe works fell between £70,000.00 and £99,999.00) on the basis of information which\nhe had commissioned from a fellow surveyor; neither of which were commensurate with\nthe 36% management fee which Ms Saunders attributed to W & A in the Application. In\ncontrast, Ms Cox told the Tribunal that the management fee relating to the site period\nwas approximately 12% of the costs of the works and that this was the market rate for the\nsupervision of such works.\n105 With regard to the points raised in relation to the 2016 agreement, it is clear that,\ngenerally, parties to an agreement are able to agree the terms by which they wish to be\nbound and that there may be circumstances in which any relationship between the\nparties may influence the manner in which those terms are framed. However, it does not\nfollow that there is necessarily anything untoward in the latter circumstance and no\nevidence was presented to the Tribunal to show that the dual role of Mr Walton was\ninstrumental in the negotiation of the terms of the 2016 agreement including the\narrangements for payment of the management fee in relation to the works. Nevertheless,\nit similarly does not follow that the management fee payable in accordance with the 2016\nagreement can necessarily be accommodated within the service charge payable by the\nleaseholders of Park West. For this to happen, such management fee must satisfy the test\nof reasonableness in section 19 of the 1985 Act. In this respect, the Tribunal does not feel\nthat a comparison with comparable terms in the 2010 agreement, which was not\nimplemented, facilitates the resolution of the question whether the actual management\nfee payable under the 2016 agreement is deemed to be reasonable. Equally, it is not\nenough to say, as suggested by Mr Temporal, that the terms of a management agreement,\nincluding the terms relating to the charging of a management fee, are negotiated\nindividually with a client’s particular requirements in mind otherwise the need for section\n19 would be negated, which is not what Parliament could have intended.\nMore telling, perhaps, in the context of the 2016 agreement, is the substantive guidance\nprovided in that section of the current RICS Code relating to the appointment of\nmanaging agents wherein it is stated in clause 3.5 that terms of engagement should\ninclude a ‘menu’ of charges for duties falling outside the scope of the annual fee i.e.\nprovision for additional amounts to be charged outside of standard management issues.\nIn this respect, clause 3.5 also makes clear that ‘all charges should be proportionate to the\ntime and amount of work involved and any service or provision of information should be\ndelivered in a reasonable timeframe.’ In this regard, there is some strength in Mr\nHealey’s arguments pertaining to the reasonableness of the management fee that the\nframing of the charging structure in the 2016 agreement, which did not include a menu of\ncharges, made it difficult to anticipate the scale of the management costs associated with\nthe works and to obtain meaningful information from W & A about those costs and the\nworks.\n30\n\n106 In turn, this examination of the project management fee charged in accordance with the\ncharging framework in the 2016 agreement brings into sharp focus its compatibility or\notherwise with the ‘industry standard’ for this type of project management and, further,\nthe bearing this may have on its reasonableness or otherwise. However, in this respect,\nthe Tribunal does not find the variable opinions expressed by the parties, which were\nunsupported by credible or compelling evidence, as sufficiently indicative of that\n‘industry standard’ or of its application which, on the evidence, makes such a comparison\nproblematic.\n107 In the light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the determination of the reasonableness\nof the management fee charged under the 2016 agreement falls within the Tribunal’s\nknowledge and experience as an expert tribunal. In applying that knowledge and\nexperience, it determines that the total amount of the management fee relating to\nprofessional work for the section 20 works which may be regarded as reasonable within\nthe meaning of section 19 of the 1985 Act and for the purposes of this Application should\nnot exceed 12.5% plus VAT of the total net cost of the works.\nArchitect’s fee\n108 Ms Saunders challenged the appointment of an Architect in a role that did not require\nany element of redesign and which was for a purpose, which, principally, involved what\nshe described as a ‘report on finishes’. In her opinion, the role of the Architect was\nunnecessary and related to matters which were within the remit of the managing agents,\nW & A.\nThe precise role and function of the Architect is set out in the specification that was\nmade available to leaseholders during the section 20 consultation (see, paragraph 23)\nand evidence was adduced by Park West RTM, notably from Mr Temporal, which showed\nthat the architect had performed the advisory role which this appointment entailed and\nfulfilled the duties expected of him.\nThe Tribunal accepts that such a role and its related duties did not necessarily have to be\nperformed by an Architect.\nHowever, the Tribunal finds that it was prudent to seek out professional advice prior to\nthe commencement of the works on the matters referred to in the specification, especially\non the questions of whether the render should be painted and, if so, what type of paint\nshould be used, and rejects the notion that the resolution of these matters necessarily fell\nwithin the expertise of W & A. In this circumstance, the appointment of an Architect was\none of a number of reasonable ways in which this professional advice might have been\nobtained. Ms Saunders did not submit any evidence to suggest that the advice and\ninformation so acquired could have been obtained, otherwise, for a lesser fee.\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that the Architect’s fee was reasonably incurred\nand that it was reasonable in amount.\nHealth and welfare facilities\n109 The specification provides for supply of these facilities for the use of site operatives\nduring the carrying out of the works. It describes the nature of those facilities (see,\nparagraph 23) and identifies their proposed location in Elliott Street. It was explained to\nthe Tribunal by Park West RTM that expenditure on these facilities in the form of a\nsecure welfare unit (portable toilet) was incurred by W & A to meet health and safety\nresponsibilities in this regard and in order to comply with the relevant provisions of the\nConstruction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 and, subsequently, invoiced to\nPark West RTM. In the light of this explanation, the Tribunal is satisfied that there was a\nsensible rationale for the expenditure incurred.\n31\n\nMs Saunders challenged such expenditure on two substantive grounds. First, she\nquestioned whether, in fact, the welfare facility had been provided. This was based on her\nexperience of driving regularly past Park West whilst the works were ongoing and on\nconversations she had held with other leaseholders, but, otherwise, uncorroborated.\nSecondly and assuming that the welfare facility was provided, Ms Saunders questioned\nthe reasonableness of the sum expended which, in her opinion, was too high; a view\nwhich was supported by Mr Healey in his submission to the Tribunal that the cost of\nproviding this facility should have been £2,000.00 (plus VAT). In neither instance, was\nthe Tribunal provided with any independent evidence in support of these propositions.\nAs to the first ground, the Tribunal is handicapped by the absence of any corroborative\nevidence in support of Ms Saunders’ statement which, in turn, is contradicted by the\nphotographic evidence presented by Park West RTM that shows several welfare units in\nsitu in Elliott Street. Further, as to the second ground, the Tribunal attaches little\nevidential weight to the unsupported statements of Ms Saunders and Mr Healey relating\nto the reasonableness of the expenditure.\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that a welfare facility was provided and determines\nthat, in the absence of compelling or persuasive evidence to the contrary, the challenged\nexpenditure was reasonably incurred and that it was reasonable in amount.\nCDM-C co-ordinator\n110 Ms Saunders challenged the appointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator, whose role and\nfunction was described in the specification as, broadly, to advise on matters of health and\nsafety, especially with a view to satisfying HSE requirements, on the basis that it was an\nunnecessary expense. More specifically, the matters allocated to the CDM-C co-ordinator\nshould have been dealt with by W & A as part of their overall responsibility to manage the\nproject in conjunction with others who were involved for the entirety of the works, there\nwas no legal obligation to appoint a CDM-C co-ordinator as the works were not notifiable\nto HSE, and the CDM Regulations 2015 do not envisage the appointment of a CDM-C co-\nordinator. Mr Healey questioned the utility of the pre-construction report prepared by\nthe CDM-C co-ordinator which he regarded as being not sufficiently directed towards\nPark West.\nThe Tribunal accepts that these matters are important considerations. However, it is not\npersuaded that they lead to the conclusion that the challenge to the appointment of the\nBCA Project Services as the CDM-C co-ordinator should be successful. In the Tribunal’s\nopinion, the manner in which it was proposed that the works were to be carried out,\nnamely through abseiling, highlighted the need for particular regard to be paid to matters\nof health and safety generated by this mode of operation. There was no cogent evidence\nto suggest that either W & A or individuals, such as the quantity surveyor or the\nplanner/programmer for the works, either individually or collectively, had sufficient\nexpertise in this respect. It follows that it was appropriate to rely upon a degree of\nspecialist expertise. In this regard, the Tribunal takes the view that, whatever the formal\nrequirements for the appointment of BCA Project Services was one of the reasonable\nways in which this advice might be obtained. In terms of the work undertaken, the\nTribunal acknowledges that the pre-construction report could have been more directly\nfocused on Park West, but, nevertheless its contents were still useful. There was no\nsuggestion that the cost of appointing BCA Project Services should be reduced to reflect\nthe perceived generality of the report.\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that the cost of appointing BCA Project Services as\nCDM-C co-ordinator was reasonably incurred and that it was reasonable in amount.\n32\n\nWorks – reasonable standard\n111 The evidence presented to the Tribunal shows that the parties accepted that there was a\nneed for work to be carried out to the exterior elevations of Park West, whereas, “the nub”\nof the dispute between them related, initially, to the ways in which such work could have\nbeen undertaken and, thereafter, whether the work which was undertaken was completed\nand, if so, to a reasonable standard. In this context, Ms Saunders also questioned the use\nof abseiling to carry out the work rather than a method that employed the use of\nscaffolding.\n112 As to alternative ways in which the work could have been undertaken, Ms Saunders and\nMr Healey on her behalf drew the Tribunal’s attention, particularly, to the prospect of\ncleaning rather than painting the render of Park West, the application of more coats of\npaint than was provided for in the specification, which had been verbally suggested to Ms\nSaunders by the paint shop and, as Mr Healey intimated, was evident from the report of\nBidwells LLP, in order to obtain the requisite finish, and, generally, expressed doubts\nabout the suitability of abseiling for carrying out the works. In these respects, the\nTribunal notes that Park West RTM took independent professional advice, especially\nfrom the retained Architect, in relation to matters pertaining to the painting of the\nbuilding and that no independent, conclusive and compelling evidence was adduced by\nMs Saunders or on her behalf in support of the view expressed about the carrying out of\nthat painting – the response to the inquiry in the paint shop is not evidenced and the\nreport of Bidwells LLP, which was commissioned by Building Transformation, was\ncontradicted to some extent by the maintenance plan for Park West for the period 2018-\n2022 which was prepared by Cloud Surveyors and adduced in evidence by Mr Temporal.\nFurther, Waaler makes it clear that following consultation with leaseholders in the\ncourse of a section 20 consultation relating to proposed works the final decision about\nthe carrying out of those works lies with the landlord. In this instance, the Tribunal has\nfound that the section 20 consultation was completed, even though there were the\npreviously rehearsed difficulties experienced by Ms Saunders (see, paragraphs 42-45). In\nthe event, Park West RTM decided that the works should be carried out by abseiling\nusing a company that was versed in abseiling and with a view to securing a satisfactory\ncompletion of the works. In choosing that option, the evidence shows that Park West\nRTM was mindful that completing the works through the use of scaffolding would have\nbeen significantly more expensive. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied that\nfor the purposes of section 19 of the 1985 Act the decision to use abseiling was\nreasonable. If this is so, it does not matter that others, including the Tribunal, might have\na chosen another reasonable course.\n113 In the context of this Application, the making of such a decision raises expectations that\nthe works will be completed and to a reasonable standard. Although Ms Saunders\nsubmitted that the works were not completed, the Tribunal was persuaded, on the\nevidence, that the works were substantially ‘completed’ albeit in an unorthodox way\nwhich, as the evidence reveals, involved W & A arranging remedial works to rectify the\nperceived shortcomings in the work undertaken by Building Transformation. It is not\nclear to the Tribunal upon what basis and with what authority W & A arranged for this\nwork to be done. Nevertheless, as Mr Temporal informed the Tribunal, Ms Brangan, one\nof the Directors of Park West RTM signed off the works as complete, although it was\nacknowledged that an area in Hermon Street had not been painted for which a deduction\nfrom the cost of the works, which was not challenged by Ms Saunders, was made.\nAs to the separate question of whether the works were undertaken to a reasonable\nstandard, the Tribunal’s inspection of Park West revealed on some elevations, as\nindicated by Mr Healey, what appeared to be uneven application of paint with different\nshaded strips and, notwithstanding the remedial work, evidence of paint splashes\n(including those on Ms Babadi’s balcony). Clearly, there are shortcomings in the work\n33\n\nthat was undertaken, and, hence, the outcome is far from perfect, but the test is not\nperfection rather it is whether the standard of the work is reasonable. The evidence\nadduced in the maintenance plan for 2018-2022 showing the anticipated minimal work\nthat will be required on the external redecoration of Park West during that period is\ninstructive and supportive of a finding that the works have been undertaken to a\nreasonable standard. Further, the case for such a finding is strengthened when the\nstandard of the works undertaken is measured against the actual cost of those works\ntaking into account, in particular, the significant saving on those costs which emanated\nfrom the settlement with Building Transformation which was reflected in a substantial\ndiscount from the final account of Building Transformation. Accordingly, the Tribunal\nfinds that the works were carried out to a reasonable standard.\nConclusion\n114 The Tribunal’s findings on the various aspects of the section 27A application reflect the\npositions adopted by Park West RTM, save in relation to the amount of the management\nfee, as may be regarded as reasonable within the meaning of section 19 of the 1985 Act\nand for the purposes of the Application, which is represented in the following Table.\nBuilding Transfer £97,505.62 (incl vat)\nless repaid -£24,003.15\nArchitect £750.00 (incl vat)\nH&S £5,077.75 (incl vat)\nCDM £1,500.00 (incl vat)\nGutter safe system £1,946.74 (incl vat)\nless credit for non painted area -£1,170.00\nProject management 12.5% £14,625.84 (incl vat)\nTOTAL £96,349.31\n2002 Act application\nPayability of administration charges\n115 Within the context of this application, paragraph 1(1) of Part 1 of Schedule 11 to the 2002\nAct defines an ‘administration charge’ as an amount payable by a tenant as part of or in\naddition to the rent, directly or indirectly, where the tenant fails to make a payment by\nthe due date to the landlord. An application which challenges the payability of such\ncharges may be made to the Tribunal under paragraph 5 of Schedule 11. (see, paragraphs\n35 -37).\n116 In respect of this application, the essence of the dispute between the parties is as follows.\nMs Saunders challenged the payability and reasonableness of two administration\ncharges, each comprising £60.00, which were included in her 2017 service charge\naccount for late payment of service charge. In the latter respect, Ms Saunders adduced no\nevidence as to what might constitute a reasonable amount for such a charge. Ms Saunders\ndoes not dispute either that she has withheld payment of her service charge (for reasons\nassociated with her Application) or that her service charge account is in arrears. Whereas,\nPark West RTM contended that the administration charges were properly applied,\nbecause Ms Saunders is not entitled to withhold payment of the service charge, especially\nthose elements of that service charge about which she has not complained. It also averred\nthat the administration charges were reasonable in amount, although it provided no\nevidence to the Tribunal as to the breakdown of the costs which were covered by the\nadministration charges. Equally, the administration charges were applied to Ms Saunders\nservice charge account on dates that fall outside the service charge period which is the\n34\n\nsubject of Ms Saunders’ Application, and, therefore, Park West RTM submitted that the\nTribunal does not have jurisdiction to make a finding in respect of these administration\ncharges.\n117 As a matter of law, the payability of administration charges for late payment of service\ncharge turns on the proper construction of the particular lease: see, St Mary’s Mansions\nLtd v Limegate Investment Company Limited [2002] EWCA Civ 1491. In this instance,\nthe relevant provisions in the lease are clause 3(1) and paragraph 2(b) of the Third\nSchedule. The latter provides that the tenant has a ‘liability to pay…all costs and expenses\nincurred…in enforcing the payment by the lessee of any…service charge…payable by the\nlessee under the terms of the lease’. As a matter of construction, the Tribunal finds that\nthe word ‘enforcing’ in this paragraph means, literally, ensuring observance of the terms\nof the lease and that this encompasses the application of an administration charge for late\nor non-payment of the service charge. Such an interpretation means that the application\nof an administration charge can act as a deterrent to non-payment and may constitute an\ninitial step in prompting payment and securing compliance with tenants’ obligations\nunder the lease.\n118 The evidence presented to the Tribunal in relation to Ms Saunders’ 2017 service charge\naccount shows that the disputed administration charges were applied to that account in\nJune and October 2017 respectively and that, consequently, they fall outside the service\ncharge year to which the Application relates i.e. April 2016-March 2017. Therefore, the\nTribunal, presently, has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon these particular disputed\nadministration charges. Suffice it to say, there is, in the Tribunal’s opinion, authority in\nthe lease for the application of administration charges in appropriate circumstances.\nSection 20C application\n119 The making of an order by the Tribunal under Section 20C is a matter of discretion. It is a\ndiscretion which may be exercised having regard to what is just and equitable in all the\ncircumstances of the particular case.\n120 Guidance on the exercise of this discretion was given in Tenants of Langford Court v\nDoren Limited (LRX/37/2000). In that case, HHJ Rich said:\n“In my judgment the only principle upon which the discretion should be exercised is to\nhave regard to what is just and equitable in all the circumstances. The circumstances\ninclude the conduct and circumstances of all parties as well as the outcome of the\nproceedings in which they arise.\n…there is no automatic expectation of an order under section 20C in favour of a\nsuccessful tenant, although a landlord who has behaved improperly or unreasonably\ncannot normally expect to recover his costs of defending such conduct.\nIn my judgment the primary consideration that the LVT should keep in mind is that the\npower to make an order under section 20C should be used only in order to ensure that\nthe right to claim costs as part of the service charge is not used in circumstances that\nmakes its use unjust…its purpose is to give an opportunity to ensure fair treatment as\nbetween landlord and tenant, in circumstances where even although costs have been\nreasonably incurred by the landlord, it would be unjust that the tenant or some particular\ntenant should have to pay them.”\n121 Further guidance is given in the Upper Tribunal decision in Conway al v Jam Factory\nFreehold Limited [2013] UKUT 0592 in which Martin Rodger QC observed that it is\nimportant to consider the overall financial consequences of making an order under\n35\n\nsection 20C, and, in particular, that an order made under the section will only affect\nthose persons specified. He also said:\n“[75] In any application under section 20C it seems to me to be essential to consider what\nwill be the practical and financial consequences for all of those who will be affected by the\norder, and to bear those consequences in mind when deciding on the just and equitable\norder to make.”\n122 As this judicial guidance makes clear, a Tribunal should not in deciding whether to\nexercise its discretion under section 20C stray from the principle which underlies the\nexercise of that discretion, namely whether it is just and equitable in all the\ncircumstances of the particular case to do so.\n123 In considering whether to exercise its discretion in relation to Ms Saunders’ Application,\nthe Tribunal took into account all the prevailing circumstances, but, particularly, the\nfollowing.\nAt the outset, it reviewed the principal circumstances which were germane to the making\nof the Application namely, the perceived dilatory response by W & A, whilst acting as\nmanaging agents, to Ms Saunders’ inquiries for information relating to the works which\nhad prompted the Application and which informed the decision of Ms Saunders to\nwithhold payment of the service charge. Thereafter, the Tribunal contemplated aspects of\nthe manner in which the proceedings were conducted. This included a general perception\non the part of the Tribunal based largely on the interchanges at the Hearing that relations\nwere strained; a situation which was not particularly conducive to the resolution of the\nmatters in dispute between the parties. And, more specifically, with regard to the matter\nof dispensation where, in the Tribunal’s opinion, the opportunity to resolve this matter\nmight have been taken sooner by Ms Saunders and where, in view of the fact that the\npossibility of a cap on costs of the works through a failure to meet the consultation\nrequirements of section 20 was explicitly referred to in the Application, a formal\napplication for dispensation by Park West RTM might have been made earlier with a\ncommensurate impact in each instance on the costs of the proceedings.\nThe Tribunal also acknowledged, in accordance with the above judicial guidance, that the\noutcome of the Application, which was predominantly in favour of Park West RTM save\nfor the finding of ‘reasonableness’ in relation to the project management fees, whilst\nrelevant was not determinative of the question of whether or not it should exercise its\ndiscretion under section 20C.\nThe Tribunal was not provided with any evidence relating to the specific financial\nconsequences of the making of an order under section 20C for either party, although, as\nthe evidence shows, the Tribunal was alerted to the significance of service charge revenue\nto the financial viability of Park West RTM.\nIn the light of all the circumstances and the backdrop to the issues addressed and\ndetermined by the Tribunal in relation to the Application, the Tribunal in exercise of its\ndiscretion under section 20C determines that it is just and equitable to make an order in\nfavour of Ms Saunders limited by way of relief to 25% of the costs incurred by Park West\nRTM in connection with the proceedings before the Tribunal. It should be added that this\nis not a determination by the Tribunal of the amount of those costs or any part thereof\nand the Tribunal’s order is without prejudice to any subsequent application by Ms\nSaunders which seeks to challenge such costs on the ground that they are considered to\nbe unreasonable.\n36\n\nSummary of Findings\n124 The findings of the Tribunal in relation to the section 27A application, the 2002 Act\napplication and the section 20C application may be summarised as follows:\nSection 27A application\nThe Tribunal finds that the section 20 consultation was completed with dispensation to\nthe extent specified in the dispensation application.\nThe Tribunal determines that the management fee for the works is £14,625.84 (including\nVAT) and that the fees/costs for the Architect, health and welfare facilities and the CDM-\nC co-ordinator were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount. The Tribunal also\ndetermines that the works were carried out to a reasonable standard and to a reasonable\neventual total net cost.\n2002 Act application\nThe Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the reasonableness or\notherwise of the administration charges challenged in this Application.\nSection 20C application\nThe Tribunal makes an order under section 20C limited to 25% of the costs incurred by\nPark West RTM in connection with the proceedings before the Tribunal.\n125 Subject to Rule 23(6) of the Tribunal Rules, this decision is binding on each of the parties\nto the application made by Ms Babadi to the extent that it relates to the common issue\nidentified in the Directions dated 12 March 2018.\nJudge David R Salter\nDate: 6th December 2018\nAppeal Provisions\n126 If any party is dissatisfied with this decision they may apply to this Tribunal for\npermission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber). Any such appeal must be\nreceived within 28 days after these written reasons have been sent to the parties (Rule 52\n0f the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013).\n127 If the party wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time limit, the party shall\ninclude with the application for permission to appeal a request for an extension of time\nand the reason for not complying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then\ndecide whether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to appeal to\nproceed.\n128 The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the Tribunal to\nwhich it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\n37"

For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR24"

The form of\nremote hearing was P:PAPERREMOTE. A face-to-face hearing was not held\nbecause no-one requested one, or it was not practicable, and all issues could\nbe determined on paper. The documents that the tribunal was referred to are a\nbundle of 117 pages, the contents of which the tribunal has noted.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nSummary of the tribunal’s decision\n(1) The appropriate premium payable for the collective enfranchisement is\n£34,652.(thirty four thousand six hundred and fifty two pounds)\nBackground\n1. This is an application made by the applicant qualifying tenants\npursuant to section 26 and 27 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and\nUrban Development Act 1993 (“the Act”) for a determination of the\npremium to be paid for the collective enfranchisement of 36 Birkbeck\nRoad Beckenham BR3 4SN (the “property”) where the Landlord cannot\nbe found.\n2. On 31 August 2021 the Bromley County Court ordered that the freehold\nshall be vested in such person or persons as may be appointed for that\npurpose by the Claimants on such terms as may be determined by the\ntribunal.\n3. On 23 September 2021, the Applicants applied to the tribunal for a\ndetermination of the premium and terms of acquisition.\nThe issues\n4. In the absence of the Landlord there are no matters agreed. The\napplicants have submitted a valuation report prepared by Mr M\nStapleton FRICS, dealing with the following matters:\n(a) The subject property is a two-storey semi-detached house\nconverted into two self-contained flats. The ground floor flat\nconsists of two bedrooms lounge kitchen bathroom/WC and the\nfloor area is approximately 68 m². The first and second floor flat\nconsists of two bedrooms, lounge and bathroom WC at first floor\nand a kitchen/breakfast room at second floor level. The flat is\ndouble glazed and has gas central heating and a floor area of 95\nm².\nMr Stapleton reports that in September 2020 when he inspected\nthe ground floor flat was in poor order requiring a programme of\nrepair and modernisation which he understands have\nsubsequently been carried out.\n(b) The valuation date is 9 March 2021\n(c) Details of the tenants’ leasehold interests:\nGround floor\n(i) the ground floor flat is held on lease for 99 years from 24\nJune 1987.\n(ii) Ground rent: the initial ground rent was £50 per annum for\nthe first 33 years rising to £100 per annum for the next 33\n2\n\nyears and finally £150 per annum for the residue of the\nlease.\n(iii) Unexpired term at valuation date: 65.29 years;\nFirst and second floors\n(iv) the first and second floors are held on lease for a term of\n189 years from 24 June 1978 at a peppercorn ground rent\nthus having an unexpired term 146.29 years. As the lease is\nover 80 years no marriage value will be payable.\nThe tribunal regards these matters as uncontroversial and they are\nsupported by documents in the bundle. The tribunal will consider the\nevidence on the following matters:\n(d) Capitalisation of ground rent: 6.00% per annum\n(e) Deferment rate: 5%.\n(f) Freehold value\n(g) Relativity; 83.53%\n(h) Development hope value; Nil\n(i) The premiums payable. Ground floor £28,775 (twenty eight\nseven hundred and seventy five pounds. First and second floors\n£300 (three hundred pounds).\nThe hearing\n5. The case was dealt with on the papers on 14 December 2021 with the\nnecessary documents provided in a bundle by the Applicant’s\nrepresentative.\n6. The tribunal was not asked to inspect the property and the tribunal did\nnot consider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection to make its\ndetermination.\n7. The applicant relied upon the expert report and valuation of Mr M\nStapleton FRICS dated 28 November 2021.\nCapitalisation rate\n8. Mr Stapleton considers that capitalisation rates remain steady at 6%.\nWhere there is higher income and good levels of growth on review rates\ncan be lower. In this case the rent is modest and not scheduled to be\nreviewed until the last 33 years of the term and he sees no reason to\nchange from that rate.\n3\n\nThe tribunal’s determination\n9. The tribunal determines that the rate to be used is 6%.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n10. The tribunal notes that a rate of 6% has been used in Mr Stapleton’s\nexperience and in the absence of any specific evidence to show that this\nshould be varied in this case the tribunal will adopt this rate.\nDeferment rate\n11. Mr Stapleton speaks to the Sportelli rate of 5%.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n12. The tribunal determines that 5% is appropriate as the deferment rate .\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n13. The tribunal sees no reason to depart from the Sportelli rate.\nFreehold value\n14. Mr Stapleton values the freehold interest in the ground floor flat at\n£250,000 and the upper maisonette at £370,000.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n15. The tribunal determines that the value of the freehold interest in the\nground floor flat is £300,000 and for the upper maisonette £370,000\nalthough this figure is not required for a marriage value calculation.\n16. Reasons for the tribunal’s determination\n17. Mr Stapleton has presented five comparable properties all of which\nhave gas central heating and double glazing. His report includes sale\nparticulars and title documents supporting their use. In his view some\nrequire some adjustment for date and he takes that into consideration.\n18. The comparable properties are summarised in the table below and the\ntribunal considers that the evidence presented suggests a higher value\nfor the ground floor than the value utilised by Mr Stapleton. The\ntribunal considers it at £250,000 is low in comparison with a one-\nbedroom flat in the same road even allowing for the fact that the flat\nlacks central heating and double glazing. Tenants improvements are\n4\n\ndisregarded. The tribunal considers the evidence supports a figure of\n£300,000.\nAddress date Description lease price Comment\nFirst Floor 93 Mar-21 First floor converted 989 yrs unexpired £ 395,000 Same road dates\nBirkbeck Road flat 2 beds reception close no adjustment\nkitchen needed\nFF 151 Blandford Mar-21 First floor converted 967.5 years £ 350,000 dates close no\nRd 2 bed flat unexpired adjustment needed\nFF 117 Blandford Oct-20 ground floor 156 yrs unexpired £ 350,500 adjusted for date to\nRd converted 1 bed flat £339,599\ngarden\nFirst Floor 121 Jan-21 3 bed FF flat simlar 125.75 yrs £ 380,000 no adjustment for\nBirkbeck Road size to upper flat unexpired date\nGround Floor flat Sep-20 ground floor 130 yrs unexpired £ 270,000 adjusted for date to\n46 Birkbeck Road converted 1 bed flat £298,250\nRelativity\n19. The tribunal determines that 81.81% is appropriate as the relativity\nrate.\n20. Relativity is only relevant to the ground floor flat. There is no evidence\nof comparable short lease sales.\n21. Mr Stapleton reports that the lower flat sold for £130,000 in July 2020\nbut through a family connection and this is not an arm’s length\ntransaction. He places little weight on the sale in consequence.\n22. The tribunal agrees with that assessment.\n23. Mr Stapleton refers to the case of Trustees of the Barry and Peggy High\nFoundation v Zucconi/Zantre (2019 UKUT 0242 (LC) which stated that\nthe First-tier Tribunal should have taken into account the Savills 2015\nenfranchisable graph, the Savills 2016 unenfranchisable graph and the\nGerald Eve 2016 unenfranchisable graph. Mr Stapleton has included in\nhis report the graphs of relativity and adopts the Zucconi rate of\n81.81%.\n24. This figure is derived from use of standard tables considered by an\nexpert witness. The tribunal considers it is supported and therefore\nadopts this figure.\nDevelopment hope value\n25. The tribunal determines that there is no development hope value to be\nincluded in the calculation.\n5\n\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n26. This is a semi-detached property which is fully utilised by the subject\nflat and there is no development potential.\nThe premium\n(2) The tribunal determines the appropriate premium to be £34,652.\n(Thirty four thousand six hundred and fifty two pounds)\n27.

The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR24"

The Respondent were directed to provide\na Hearing Bundle. References to this bundle (1,275 pages) will the prefixed by\n\"HB.__\". The Applicants have produced an additional bundle which extends\nto 950 pages. Reference to this will be prefixed by \"A.__\"). This includes a\nnumber of photographs. The Applicants have also provided a number of\nvideos. and videos.\n2\n\nIntroduction\n1. The Tribunal is required to determine six applications brought by seven tenants\nwho hold leases at four blocks at Warren Close, Hayes, UB4 0XY who seek a\ndetermination of the payability and reasonableness of the service charges\npursuant to section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (\"the Act\"). The\napplication relates to the sums charged for cyclical works (Issue 1); the service\ncharges for 2023/24 (Issue 2) and the interim service charges payable for\n2024/25 (Issue 3). The service charge accounts for 2024/25 are not yet\navailable.\n2. Warren Close is a development of 24 residential one bedroom flats across five\nblocks. Pentagon House and Welles House have six flats on three floors. Meade\nHouse and Kingfisher House have 4 flats on two floors. The fifth block, with\nwhich the Tribunal is not concerned, is Sovereign House which has four flats.\nAll the tenants pay a service charge of 4.167%.\n3. The development was completed in 1994. The flats originally had wooden sash\nwindows. Northcote Housing Association Limited granted shared ownership\nleases to the tenants. There have been a number of changes in the identity of\nthe landlord. On some unspecified date, Catalyst Housing Ltd (\"Catalyst\")\nacquired the freehold interest. On 1 April 2022, Catalyst became a subsidiary of\nthe Respondent. Four of the tenants have \"staircased up\" and now own 100% of\nthe beneficial interest in their flats. Mr Hoareau is one of these tenants.\n4. The following are parties to this application:\n(i) Mr Nazim Shah (Flat 1 Pentagon House). He acquired his lease in September\n2013.\n(ii) Mr Laurence Hoareau (Flat 2 Pentagon House).\n(iii) Mr Peter Latawiec (Flat 3 Pentagon House).\n(iv) Mr Tiamour Osman (Flat 6 Pentagon House). He acquired the lease in\nOctober 2003. He is a sales engineer. He occupies his flat on his own.\n(v) Mr Carl Jackson (Flat 3 Meade House). He is a special needs teacher. He\noccupies his one bedroom flat with his wife and two children. He acquired his\nflat in August 2014.\n(vi) Mr Gavin Frederick (Flat 4 Kingfisher House).\n(vii) Mr Jeyasingham Puvendran (Flat 5 Welles House). He acquired his lease\nin July 2007. He is a sales engineer. He occupies his flat on his own.\n5. The parties have provided a Scott Schedule (HB.92-114). This raises a total of\n46 service charge items which are challenged. Ms Traynor comments that this\n3\n\nis a \"wholly unhelpful document\" in trying to identify the substance of the\nApplicants' complaints. She has provided a summary of the items challenged\nfor the service charge year 2023/24 and the interim service charge for 2024/25.\nHowever, there are 31 challenges to cyclical works which were carried out\nbetween July and October 2022. Confusion has arisen because the Respondent\ninitially apportioned the costs attributable to the five individual blocks. The\nRespondent then recognised that this was not in accordance with the terms of\nthe leases. The charges were then reissued apportioning the cost of the works\nequally between the 24 flats. However, because of the delays that had occurred,\nthe Respondent recognised that no tenant could be required to pay more; rather\na refund was made to those tenants who had been overcharged.\n6. The three lead tenants, Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau and Mr Jackson, have jointly\nmade a witness statement (at HB.337-344). Mr Hoareau has taken the initiative\npreparing the case for the Applicants. Unfortunately, due to the untimely death\nof his wife, Mr Hoareau was unable to attend the hearing. Her funeral was held\non the first day of the hearing. The tenants were anxious for their application to\nproceed in his absence. Mr Shah, Mr Jackson and Mr Puendran attended the\nhearing and gave evidence on behalf of the Applicants. Mr Osman attended on\nthe second day of the hearing. Mr Shah provided a Skeleton Argument.\n7. Mr Shah complained that it was wrong that tenants who only had a 30% share\nin the equity of their flat, should be required to pay 100% of the service charge.\nThe Tribunal explained that this was the contractual position as provided in the\nlease. Further, it was the standard model for shared ownership leases in\nEngland. If this is considered to be unfair, this is a matter for the Regulator of\nSocial Housing and/or parliament. It is not a matter for this Tribunal.\n8. Ms Katherine Traynor (Counsel) appeared on behalf of the Respondent. She\nwas accompanied by both Ms Mary Walsh and Mr Jordan Corrall from her\ninstructing solicitor, Winkworth Sherwood. She adduced evidence from Ms\nSandraline Kamba, the Respondent's Service Charge Specialist (statement at\nHB.293-303); Ms Samantha Dhanilall, the Respondent's Regional Home\nOwnership Manager for North West London (statement at HB.304-311) and Ms\nSatinder Bedi, the Respondent's Project Manager (statements at HB.688-690\nand HB.312-316). Ms Traynor provided a Skeleton Argument and a Bundle of\n15 authorities.\n9. The Applicants have come together because they are concerned about the level\nof the service charges that they have been required to pay. This has been\ninstigated by the cost of a programme of cyclical repairs. They also complain of\nthe quality of the works. Their attack is unfocussed. Their witness statement\nextends to just 8 pages. Their witness statement does not address the numerous\nphotographs in their bundle of 1,275 pages and the videos which they have\nprovided.\n10. The Applicants are litigants in person. However, they must recognise that they\nmust identify the issues that they require the tribunal to determine and prove\ntheir case as to why the service charges are not payable or are unreasonable.\n4\n\n11. Ms Traynor states that the Respondent's approach has at all times been to\nengage constructively by responding to the Applicants’ queries, providing\ndocumentation, and addressing, within these proceedings, as many of the\npoints made as can practically be achieved. The Respondent approached the\nhearing in the same vein in the hope of a more constructive relationship moving\nforward.\nThe Leases\n12. The Tribunal has been provided with the leases for Flats 1 and Flats 6 Pentagon\nHouse; Flat 3 Meade House; and Flat 4 Kingfisher House. Although the\nTribunal has stated that all tenants are required to pay a service charge of\n4.167%, this is not strictly correct. The lease for Flat 6 Pentagon House specifies\na percentage of 0.04167% and that for 4 Kingfisher House a percentage of\n0.4167%. The parties accepted that these are manifest errors and 4.167% is the\ncorrect percentage for all leases.\n13. The \"Buildings\" are defined as including the five blocks. Thus the 4.167% service\ncharge extends to the costs of repairing, decorating and repairing any of the five\nblocks.\n14. By Clause 3 (2)(c), the Leaseholder covenants to pay the Service Charge in\naccordance with Clause 7. Clause 7 (2) contains a covenant on the part of the\nLeaseholder to pay the Service Charge during the Term by monthly equal\npayments in advance on the first day of each month. The \"Service Charge\" is\ndefined in Clause 7 (1)(d) as the \"Specified Proportion of the Service Provision\".\nThe \"Specified Proportion\" is defined as ‘the proportion specified in the\nParticulars”, namely 4.167%.\n15. Clause 5 sets out the Landlord's covenants. Clause 5(2) is a covenant to insure\nthe Buildings. By Clause 5 (3), the Landlord covenants to maintain, repair and\ndecorate the roof, foundations, main structure of the Buildings, and all external\nparts including the windows and doors (but excluding the glass).\n16. The \"Service Provision\" (by Clause 7 (4)) is calculated by an estimate of the\nexpenditure likely to be incurred in a relevant year together with an amount\ntowards a reserve. Clause 7 (5) provides as follows; \"The relevant expenditure\nto be included in the Service Provision shall comprise all expenditure\nreasonably incurred by the Landlord in connection with the repair,\nmanagement, maintenance and provision of services for the Building…\" and\nincludes specifically the cost of the Landlord’s performance of covenants\ncontained in Clauses 5 (2), 5 (3) and 5 (4). As soon as practicable after the end\nof each Account Year the Landlord determines whether the estimate has\nexceeded or fallen short of the actual expenditure in the Account year (clause 7\n(6)).\nThe Law\n5\n\n17. Section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the Act”) defines the concepts\nof “service charge” and “relevant costs”:\n“(1) In the following provisions of this Act “service charge” means an\namount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to the\nrent—\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements or insurance or the landlord’s costs\nof management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to the\nrelevant costs.”\n(2) The relevant costs are the costs or estimate costs incurred or to be\nincurred by or on behalf of the landlord, or a superior landlord, in\nconnection with matters for which the service charge is payable.”\n18. Section 19 gives this Tribunal the jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness\nof any service charge:\n“(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the\namount of a service charge payable for a period—\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the\ncarrying out of works, only if the services or works are of a\nreasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.”\n19. The Supreme Court has recently reviewed the approach that should be adopted\nby tribunals in considering the reasonableness of service charges in Williams v\nAviva Investors Ground Rent GP Ltd [2023] UKSC 6; [2023] 2 WLR 484. Lord\nBriggs JSC (at [14]) recognised that the making of a demand for payment of a\nservice charge will have required the landlord (or manager in this case) first to\nhave made a number of discretionary management decisions. These will include\nwhat works to carry out or services to perform, with whom to contract for their\nprovision and at what price, and how to apportion the aggregate costs among\nthe tenants benefited by the works or services. To some extent the answers to\nthose questions may be prescribed in the lease, for example by way of a\ncovenant by the landlord to provide a list of specified services, or by a fixed\napportionment regime. But even the most rigid and detailed contractual regime\nis likely to leave important decisions to the discretion of the landlord. A landlord\nis contractually obliged to act reasonably. This is subject to this Tribunal’s\n6\n\njurisdiction under the 1985 Act to determine whether the landlord acted\nreasonably (see [33]).\n20. The Tribunal highlights the following passage from the judgment of Martin\nRodger KC, the Deputy President, in Enterprise Home Developments LLP v\nAdam [2020] UKUT 151 (LC) at [28]: \"Much has changed since the Court of\nAppeal’s decision in Yorkbrook v Batten but one important principle remains\napplicable, namely that it is for the party disputing the reasonableness of sums\nclaimed to establish a prima facie case.\"\n21. Section 20 of the Act requires a landlord to consult in respect of and “qualifying\nworks” where the relevant contribution of any tenant will exceed £250. The\nconsultation requirements applicable in the present case are contained in Part\n2 of Schedule 4 to the Service Charge (Consultation Requirements) (England)\nRegulations 2003. A summary of these is set out in the speech of Lord\nNeuberger in Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson [2013] UKSC 14; [2013] 1 WLR\n854 at [12]:\nStage 1: Notice of Intention to do the Works: Notice must be given to each\ntenant and any tenants’ association, describing the works, or saying\nwhere and when a description may be inspected, stating the reasons for\nthe works, specifying where and when observations and nominations for\npossible contractors should be sent, allowing at least 30 days. The\nlandlord must have regard to those observations.\nStage 2: Estimates: The landlord must seek estimates for the works,\nincluding from any nominee identified by any tenants or the association.\nStage 3: Notice about Estimates: The landlord must issue a statement to\ntenants and the association, with two or more estimates, a summary of\nthe observations, and its responses. Any nominee’s estimate must be\nincluded. The statement must say where and when estimates may be\ninspected, and where and by when observations can be sent, allowing at\nleast 30 days. The landlord must have regard to such observations.\n4: Notification of reasons: Unless the chosen contractor is a nominee or\nsubmitted the lowest estimate, the landlord must, within 21 days of\ncontracting, give a statement to each tenant and the association of its\nreasons, or specifying where and when such a statement may be\ninspected.\nThe Background\n22. In 2019, the development was being managed by Catalyst. The time had come\nfor a programme of external repairs and decorations (\"cyclical repairs\"). The\nlandlord arranged for the development to be inspected by Michael Doherty from\nig9 LLP (\"ig9\"). His inspection report, dated 11 January 2019, is at HB.691-722.\nHe noted that the windows were timber framed double glazed sash units. They\n7\n\nwere in a poor condition with chipped and flaking decoration. Numerous\nglazing units had failed. There were isolated areas of wet rot. He recommended\nthat the windows be replaced with new UPVC double glazed units.\n23. On 5 April 2019, Catalyst served a Stage 1 \"Notice of Intention\" on the tenants\n(at HB.595-596). The tenants were notified of the proposal to replace the\nwindows with double glazed UPVC units. Catalyst balloted the tenants on the\npreferred colour on the inside of the new windows. The external face was to be\nbrown as existing. Eleven of the 24 tenants responded to the ballot. On 12\nDecember 2019, Catalyst served a \"Notice of Estimates\". However, this was\nlater withdrawn. Apparently, the tenants were told that the cost of the works\nwould be some £105k (exc VAT).\n24. On 24 February 2020, Catalyst held a meeting with the tenants to discuss a\nnumber of concerns that had been raised. Ms Bedi attended the meeting. The\nminutes of the meeting are at HB.725-727. Tenants were concerned about the\ncost of the works and the payment plan that was being offered. Tenants queried\nwhether it would be possible to install casement, rather than sash, windows.\nThe cost would be lower. Catalyst responded that planning consent had been\nsought for a \"like-for-like\" replacement of sash windows.\n25. On 23 March 2020, the first lockdown was imposed and the works were put on\nhold. On 18 March 2021, Catalyst held a further meeting with tenants by zoom.\nThe minutes are at HB.728-730. Some tenants against repeated their\npreference for casement windows. They again complained about the cost of the\nworks. Catalyst responded that this should have been raised in response to the\nNotice of Intention. The Respondent had proceeded on the basis of like-for-like\ncasement windows. The tenants queried why the works had not been included\nin the annual budget and why they could not be funded from reserves. It was\nagreed to omit the door entry replacement to save money.\n26. In April 2021, there was a second ballot as to whether the windows should be\nstandard top hung UPVC casement windows or UPVC sash windows. On 6 April\n(HB.1239), Ms Bedi wrote to Mr Shah with estimates of the relative cost of\ninstalling top hung casement windows (£124,137) and sash windows (£153,117).\nThe ballot closed on 14 April. Twelve tenants voted, six for each option.\n27. In June 2021, ig9 prepared a specification of works (at HB.786-791). This\nprovided for sash windows. On 23 June 2021, ig9 invited three contractors to\nquote for the replacement of the windows. Three tenders were returned\n(at.HB.755-7). Ig9 prepared a tender report and recommended that the\nPrincipal Contractor appoint Symphony, who had provided the lowest quote.\n28. In August 2021, ig9 prepared a further tender report for the other cyclical works\n(HB.758-774). Five tenders were invited and four were returned (at HB.775-\n778). Ig9 recommended that Probuild (London) Limited (PBL) who had\nprovided the lowest quote be appointed as the Principal Contractor.\n8\n\n29. On 27 August 2021 (at HB.597-601), Catalyst sent out the Notice of Estimates.\nCatalyst informed the tenants that they had decided to proceed with sash\nwindows. The outcome of the ballot had been a draw. Catalyst had therefore\ndecided to proceed under the existing planning application to install \"like-for-\nlike\" sash windows. Details of the estimates were provided. Catalyst proposed\nto appoint PBL as the Principal Contractor who had quoted £135,549 (exc VAT)\nand Symphony Windows, who had quoted £144,648 to replace the windows. To\nthis would be added VAT of 20% and professional fees of £15,000. For the six\ntenants at Pentagon House, the cost of the works would be £93,370, less a\nreserve fund contribution of £14,688. The estimated cost per tenant was\n£13,113.79.The Respondent offered a 12 month payment agreement.\n30. On 23 September 2021 (at HB.602), Mr Puvendran responded to the\nconsultation. He inquired why the costs had gone up by 50%.\n31. On 28 February 2022, Catalyst held a further meeting with tenants. The\nminutes are at HB.778-785. Fifteen tenants attended. John McDonnell MP also\nattended. The tenants queried the cost of the works. It was again suggested that\ncasement windows would have been cheaper. A tenant suggested that the\nreplacement of the windows was only required because of historic neglect.\nTenants asked how they could afford the works. Catalyst offered a repayment\nplan dependent upon the financial circumstances of the individual tenants. Mr\nHoareau states that he asked the meeting to confirm whether they preferred\ncasement windows to the sash windows that were proposed. 14 voted for\ncasement windows (58% of the total of 24 leaseholders). This vote did not\nappear in the minutes.\n32. On 1 April 2022, Catalyst became a subsidiary of Peabody. On 23 June (HB.952-\n955), Ms Bedi wrote to the tenants about the proposed works. She was the\nProject Manager. She has provided a detailed witness statement and gave\nevidence. The works started on 18 July and were completed on 21 October 2022.\nThe communal windows were installed in the week commencing 28 November\n2022. There is a substantial dispute between the parties as to the quality of the\nworks, which the Tribunal needs to determine.\n33. Ms Bedi sates that the programme of works consisted of the following: erect\nscaffolding; R & D survey; clean roofs; rainwater goods overhaul; Clean soffits\nand fascia; replace windows and doors; mastic, masonry works and cleaning;\nexternal decorations; and strike scaffolding.\n34. The final cost of the cyclical repairs was £364,777.43, namely (i) cost of works:\n£264,331.47; (ii) VAT: £52,866.29; + (iii) Professional fees (15%): £47,579.66.\n£131,000 was funded from the reserve fund. Thus the cost to be charged to\ntenants was £233,777.43. This should have been charged equally to the 24 flats,\nnamely £9,740.73 per tenant.\n35. On 29 January 2024, Peabody issued the initial demands for the works (at\nHB.634-672). The cost of the works were incorrectly apportioned based on an\nequal apportionment of the works carried out to the individual blocks. This was\n9\n\nincorrect. The leases define \"the buildings\" as the five blocks. The cost should\ntherefore have been apportioned equally between the 24 tenants. On 15 March\n2024 (at p.650-660), Peabody issued revised demands. This resulted in some\ntenants receiving a refund. However, the Respondent recognised that it was\nnow too late to issue a supplementary demand to those who had been charged\ntoo little.\nInitial Adjusted Benefit\nTenant Demand Demand\nNazim Shah (1 Pentagon House) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nLaurence Hoareau (2 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nPeter Latawiec (3 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nTiamour Osman (6 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nCarl Jackson (3 Meade House) £10,484.98 £9,740.73\nGavin Frederick (4 Kingfisher) £9,907.10 £9,740.73\nJeyasingham Puvendran £9,513.91 - £226.82\n(5 Welles House)\n36. On 28 April 2024, Mr Shah issued his application to this Tribunal. His main\ncomplaint was the sum that he had been charged for these cyclical works.\nHowever, he also challenges a number of service charges for 2023/24 and the\ninterim service charge for 20224/25. Over the subsequent weeks, tenants\nissued five further application.\nIssue 1: The Cyclical Works\n37. The Applicants raised a number of wide ranging arguments as to why they are\nnot obliged to contribute to the cost of the major works. We can deal with many\nof these briefly:\n(i) The Applicants suggest that the need for the works arises through \"historic\nneglect\". We are satisfied that for such a claim to succeed, the Applicants would\nneed to establish a counterclaim or set-off (see Continental Property Ventures\nInc v White [2007] L.& T.R.4). In particular, any tenant would need to establish\nthat he had a good claim for disrepair during the time that they were the lessee.\nNo tenant has established this. The ig9 Inspection Report, dated 11 January\n2019, does not suggest any widespread disrepair. It is consistent with what one\nwould expect from wooden windows which after 25 years were nearing the end\nof their natural lives.\n(ii) The Applicants rely on Clause 3 (19) of their leases to argue that they are\nonly liable for the cost of any repairs, insofar as the tenant caused or contributed\nto the disrepair by any act, neglect or default. This is to fail to understand the\nterms of the lease. If any individual tenant has caused any disrepair, he has a\npersonal responsibility to make good that damage. However, the landlord is\nrequired to repair, maintain and decorate the Buildings, and this is a service\ncharge expenditure for which all the tenants are liable.\n10\n\n(iii) The landlord failed to comply with the statutory consultation procedures.\nOn 5 April 2019, the Respondent served the Stage 1 \"Notice of Intention\". At\nthis stage, the tenants did not suggest casement windows. Neither did they\nsuggest a contractor from whom an estimate should be sought. On 27 August\n2021, the Respondent served the Stage 3 \"Notice of Estimates\". The Respondent\nhad tested the market and obtained four tenders for the work as \"Principal\nContractor\" and the for the replacement of the windows. The Respondent\nselected the lowest estimates.\n(iv) The Applicants complain of the overall cost of the works. There was an\nunfortunate delay in 2020 which was inevitable because of the Covid-19 lock\ndown. However, there was no need for the Respondent to serve a further \"Notice\nof Intention\". When the Covid-19 lockdown was lifted, there was a significant\nincrease in building costs. The Applicants were a victim of this.\n(v) The Applicants contend that the supervision fee of 15% was unreasonable.\nWe disagree. It is a standard charge for works of this type. However, we have\nfound that the supervision of this contract was inadequate (see below). We\ntherefore reduce The professional fees of £47,579.66 by £1,000 to reflect this.\n38. A particular concern raised by the Applicants, is the Respondent's decision to\ninstall sash, rather than casement, windows. All agreed that UPVC windows\nshould replace the existing wooden sash windows. It is common ground that\ncasement windows would have been cheaper (on 6 April 2021, Ms Bedi had\nsuggested that the cost would have been £124,137, as against £153,117). Mr\nJackson suggested that the cost would have been much cheaper and obtained a\nquote from Safe Style (at HB1,242) of £3,000 to install casement windows in\nhis flat. He also obtained a quote (at HB.1243) of £350 + VAT for use of a cherry\npicker for 7 days. The cost of scaffolding for some 15 weeks was £30,370.\n39. The Tribunal does not accept that it would have been appropriate to use a cherry\npicker for a job of this size. We do accept that the installation of the casement\nwould have been somewhat cheaper, say some £30k. However, we accept that\nthe Respondent was entitled to select sash, rather than casement, windows. Ms\nBedi stated that it was the Respondent's policy to replace windows on a like-for-\nlike basis for possible. The tenants had only raised the issue at a late stage in the\nconsultation process.\n40. Whilst a landlord must consult its tenants, it has the ultimate discretion as to\nwhat windows should be installed (see [19] above). The landlord was required\nto have due regard to views expressed by the tenants; it was not bound to accept\nthe majority view of the tenants. Catalyst's starting point was to go for sash\nwindows on a \"like-for-like\" basis. All agreed that UPVC was a more cost\neffective option that wood. It was only at a later stage that the tenants opted for\ncasement windows. In April 2021, the tenants had been split 50:50 on the two\noptions. The approach adopted by the Respondent cannot be categorised as\nunreasonable, albeit that the sash windows were somewhat more expensive. We\nare satisfied that the Respondent had regard to the financial impact of the works\non the tenants.\n11\n\n41. In their Scott Schedule, the Applicants challenge 31 items relating to the cyclical\nworks. Most relate to the quality of the works. The Applicants have provided a\nBundle of 950 pages. This includes a large number of photographs. The problem\nthat the Tribunal faces is that none of the photographs are dated. The\nApplicants have produced no evidence of who took the photos or the block to\nwhich they relate. They are no more than \"snapshots\". They show areas where\nworks have not been done. These are often small areas in the context of a job of\nthis size. They do not show areas where works have been done to a good\nstandard. Some disrepair may have arisen after the works were completed.\nSome photos relating to general maintenance problems, rather than to the\nprogramme of cyclical works. Many of the defects may now have been remedied.\n42. The photographs illustrate the following:\n(i) Disrepair to the brickwork (A.7-16; 895-896).\n(ii) Broken Vents (A.24-27).\n(iii) Defects to the casement windows (A.31-36).\n(iv) Defects to the communal doors (A.42-57, 815-818, 855-860, 867-872).\n(v) Disrepair to the communal lights (A.58-62).\n(vi) The photographs illustrate numerous defects to the new doors and windows\n(A.68-89, 799-803). The Tribunal notes the communal window at A.73 where a\nblock of wood has been inserted between the base of the window and the\nbrickwork.\n(vii) External fencing (A.396-415. 789-798, 805-815, 864-866, 873-878, 899-\n904).\n(viii) Defects to gutter soffits and rainwater good (A.426-434).\n(ix) Pointing Defects (A.569-572).\n(x) Defects to the roof and guttering (A.575-625). The photograph at A.592\nillustrated the debris which was left in the guttering. The photograph at A.596\nillustrates dirty soffits. The photograph at A.608 illustrates a loose verge cap\nwhich required attention.\n(xi) Defects to the stone cills (A.651-664).\n(xii) Disrepair to the knee high fencing (A.786-788, 803-804,861-863)\n(xiii) Defects to grills (A,907-908);\n12\n\n(xiv) Moss and lichen on the roofs: Pentagon House (A.911-915); Welles House\n(A.918-922); Kingfisher House (A.925-932) and Meade House (A.936-942).\nThese photographs provide compelling evidence that inadequate attention was\npaid to cleaning the roofs.\n43. The Tribunal is satisfied that the photographs depict poor finishes, bad\nworkmanship and areas where defects still remain. Some items are fairly\nstraight forward. For example, there is ample of evidence to suggest the roofs\nhave not been properly cleaned. The same applies to the gutters.\n44. Some of the paint from the external decorations is peeling. The Tribunal would\nnot expect it to be peeling so soon after the works have been completed. The\nApplicants have provided a report from Dulux confirming that the preparation\nis poor . They had sent samples to Dulux for testing (A.781-785).\n45. Mr Jackson complained that there had been a problem of condensation in his\nflat after the new windows had been installed. We note that he is living in his\none bedroom flat with his wife and two children. We suspect that the\ncondensation problem is due to the interaction between the moisture produced\nwithin the flat and the equation of ventilation, heating and insulation. The new\nwindows are likely to have reduced draughts from the old ill-fitting windows.\nWe are not satisfied that the condensation relates to the negligent installation\nof the windows.\n46. In her witness statement, Ms Bedi gives detailed evidence of the steps taken by\nthe Respondent to supervise the works. Snagging items were identified and\naddressed. Ms Bedi also gives evidence of the contact which she had with some\nof the Applicants:\n(i) Mr Hoareau (2 Pentagon House): On 14 December 2022 (at HB.1026), Mr\nHoareau raised a number of concerns relating to the windows and door in his\nflat. On 3 February 2023 (HB.1014), she sent an email to Mr Hoareau stating\nthat the defects had been remedied. Mr Hoareau did not respond to this.\n(ii) Mr Puvendran (5 Welles House): In December 2022, Mr Puvendran\ncomplained that draughts were coming through his windows in the bedroom\nand living room. Symphony agreed to fit a thicker gasket as a matter of good\nwill. The correspondence is at HB.1027-1037). Mr Puvendran was not satisfied\nwith the Respondent's response and invoked their complaint's procedure. On\n10 June 2024 (at HB.1161-4), the Respondent offered him £450 in\ncompensation. Mr Puvendran did not accept this offer.\n47. The Tribunal addresses the additional following items raised by the Applicants\nin their Scott Schedule:\n(i) Asbestos: The Applicant complain that no asbestos was removed. The\nRespondent agree. This item was removed from the final account. We accept\nthis.\n13\n\n(ii) Repointing masonry (£189.81). The Applicant complains that this was not\ncarried out to a reasonable standard. The Respondent disputes this. This is a\nmodest sum which we allow.\n(iii) Removal/Refix of TV aerials (£379.62). The Applicant complains that only\none aerial was removed. The Respondent agrees, but states that this was an\nitemised cost which did not depend on the number of units. The Tribunal agrees\nthat it was reasonable to include this in the contract specification.\n(iv) Clean soffits and fascias (£1,391.94). The Applicants state that no items\nwere cleaned. The Respondent states that this work was carried out and signed\noff. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an\nadequate standard. The Tribunal disallows £700.\n(v) Clean stone sills (£1,265.40). The Applicants state that no items were\ncleaned. The Respondent states that this work was carried out and signed off.\nThe Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an adequate\nstandard. The Tribunal disallows £600.\n(vi) Apply mastic to windows (£5,036.55): The Applicants assert that this was\npart of the basic installation and should not have been charged separately. The\nRespondent asserts that the specification made it clear that this work was to be\ndone by a specialist mastic contractor. The Tribunal is satisfied that the\nRespondent was entitled to take this course.\n(vii) Overheads/profit and Attendance (£23,400). The Applicants contend that\nthis is a vague charge which cannot be justified. The Respondent replies that\nthis is a standard charge in the trade. The Tribunal agree.\n(viii) Rain water goods (£2,480.18). The Applicants complain about the quality\nof the works. The Respondent replies that the work was water tested and signed\noff. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an\nadequate standard. It does not accept that the debris shown in the photographs\narose subsequently. The Tribunal disallows £1,000.\n(ix) Clean Roof Tiles and replaced damaged tiles. The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. The Tribunal does not consider that this work\nwas carried out to an adequate standard and disallow £500.\n(x) External Decoration and Woodwork (£8,225.10). The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. They rely on their report from Dulux. The\nRespondent replies that the work was carried out to a satisfactory standard and\nwas signed off. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to\nan adequate standard and disallow £3,000.\n14\n\n(xi) Staining to woodwork (£5,061.60). The Applicants state that the woodwork\nwas not stained. The Respondent replies that the work was carried out to a\nsatisfactory standard and was signed off. We agree.\n(xii) Decoration to the communal doors (£1,898.10). The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. Although the Applicants have provided a\nnumber of photographs, they have not satisfied us that any reduction should be\nmade.\n(xiii) Replacement of damaged vents (£197.99). The Applicants complain that\nthey have been charged for 15, but only 11 were replaced. The Respondent\nreplies that the work was satisfactory and was signed off. This is a modest sum\nwhich we allow.\n(xiv) Replace sections of knee high fence (£1,600). The Applicants complain\nthat only one small section was replaced. The Respondent replies that the work\nwas carried out to a section of fencing on a client instruction. Although the\nphotograph indicate some disrepair to the fencing, the Applicants have not\nsatisfied that these sections were included in the contract. We allow this charge.\n(xv) Ridge tile replacement and repointing (£1,125). The Applicants complain\nthat this work was not carried out. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. The photographs indicate a number of defects\nand we disallow £500.\n(xvi) Brickwork repairs (£800). The Applicants assert that this was not part of\nthe cyclical works. The Respondent replies that it was. The work was checked\nand signed off. We allow this item.\n(xvii) Fencing repairs prior to redecoration (£450). The Applicants complain\nthat no fences were repaired. In any event, the fencing is not part of the estate.\nThe Respondent replies that minor works were executed to parts of fencing\nwhich fall within the estate. We allow this modest charge.\n(xviii) Pest proof vents (£360). The Applicants initially asserted that no vents\nwere pest proofed. The Applicants now accept that work was carried out to one\nvent but not to an adequate standard. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory. The Applicants have not satisfied us that we should disallow this\nitem.\n(xix) Rake out and repoint gaps to sub cills (£75). The Applicants assert that no\nwork was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and\nsigned off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xx) Rake out and repoint window heads (£75). The Applicants assert that no\nwork was done.

The Applicants assert\nthat no work was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed\nand signed off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xxii) Repointing of brickwork above rear door of 1 Welles House (£95). The\nApplicants initially asserted that only one was replaced. They now accept the\nneed to pay a reasonable amount. The Respondent replies that the work was\ncompleted and signed off. 16 verge caps were completed. We allow this modest\nsum.\n(xxiii) Supply and fit new dry verge caps where missing (£95). The Applicants\nassert that no work was done. The Respondent replies that the work was\ncompleted and signed off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xxiv) Rebuild bin stores (£595).

The Respondent replies that the work was completed and signed off.\nWe allow this item.\n(xxv) Remove ivy (£50). The Applicants complain that they have been double\ncharged as this was part of the gardening contract. The Respondent replies that\nthe work was completed as part of the cyclical works programme and signed off.\nWe allow this modest item.\n(xxvi) Repoint 5 window fills (£100). The Applicants complain that this is part\nof the window replacement and they are being charged twice. The Respondent\nreplies that the work was carried out to the first floor cills in three blocks. The\nworks were completed and signed off. We allow this modest item.\n(xxvii) CT1 window fills (£75). The Applicants complain that this was part of the\nwindow installation and they are being charged twice. The Respondent denies\nthat there has been any duplication. The work was carried out to the window\ncills on the first floors at Kingfisher House, Sovereign Hose and Meade Houe.\nWe allow this modest charge,\n(xxviii) Relay dropped tiles gable end Meade House (£1,700): The Applicants\ncomplain that this work was not done. The Respondent replies that the work\nwas completed and signed off. We allow this modest item.\n(xxix) Window and door replacement (£144,648 + VAT). The only issue raised\nby the Applicants is that of historic neglect. We have already rejected this\nchallenge (see [37(i)] above).\n48. The Tribunal have made modest deductions of £7,300 out of a contract in the\nsum of £364,777. Each Applicant is therefore entitled to a deduction of £304.17.\nHowever, whilst Mr Jackson and Mr Frederick paid their full 4.167%\ncontribution towards the works, Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau, Mr Latawiec and Mr\nOsman paid £186.57 less than his full share, whilst Mr Puvendran paid £226.82\n16\n\nless (see Table at [35] above). We consider that these sums should be credited\nagainst the reductions that we have made. Thus we make deductions of (i)\n£117.60 for Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau, Mr Latawiec and Mr Osman; (ii) £304.17 for\nMr Jackson and Mr Frederick and (iii) £77.35 for Mr Puvendran.\nIssue 2: The Service Charges for 2023/24\n49. The Service Charge Account for April 2023 to March 2024 is at HB.371. This is\nbroken down to the 4.167% which each tenant is required to pay. The total\nservice charge for the year was £1,685.53, whilst the budget was £1,586,88. The\ntenants were therefore required to pay an additional £98.65.\n50. The Applicants challenge six items. The Respondent has conceded three of\nthese:\n(i) Communal Electricity: The Respondent has agreed to reduce the sum\ncharged of £176.72 by £88.36.\n(ii) Smoke Vents & Fire Systems: The Respondent has recognised that there was\na mistake and have reduced the sum of £87.06 to £64.24, a credit of £22.82.\n(iii) Gardening Scheme: The Respondent has agreed to a 50% reduction from\n£167.75 to £83.33. The Applicants have provided a number of photographs of\nthe state of the garden (at A.892-894). Ms Kamba stated that the Respondent\nhad made the reduction as a gesture of good will.\n51. Three items remain in dispute:\n(i) Communal Maintenance/Repairs: £42.11. The Applicants had initially\nasserted that no communal repairs had been executed. Ms Kamba has produced\nthe invoices. The Applicants then complained about the quality of the works. At\nthe hearing, the Applicants confirmed that this item was no longer in dispute.\n(ii) Entry Phone: £48.35. The Applicants contend that there was no evidence of\nany work being done. Ms Kamba has provided details of the four invoices which\ntotal £1,160.44 at HB.436. We therefore allow this.\n(iii) Property Insurance: £259.33. The Applicants' complaint is that the budget\nhad included a sum of £41.16 had appeared in the budget, whilst the actual sum\nwas £259.33. The charge in the previous year had been £31.68. Ms Kamba gave\na full explanation for the increase in the insurance. The charge of £31.68 had\nbeen a legacy charge from their block policy. This reflected two factors: (i)\nCatalyst had undervalued its properties by some 50%; (ii) the cover had been\narranged through Legacy who had offered rates substantially below the market.\nLegacy have now withdrawn from the social housing market. Ms Kamba\ndescribes how Peabody had consulted on a proposal for a Qualifying Lont-Term\nAgreement for insurance. She provides reasons as to why insurance has\n17\n\nincreased. Peabody had explained why insurance had gone up on their website\n(at HB.475-8). The Applicants have not provided any evidence that insurance\ncould have been secured at a lower premium. We are an expert tribunal. We are\nsatisfied that an insurance charge of £259.33 is reasonable for these one\nbedroom flats.\n52. It is agreed that the Applicants are entitled to refunds of £194.51.\nIssue 3: The Interim Service Charges for 2024/25\n53. The budget for the year is at HB.550. The Tribunal explained that any landlord\nhas to make a judgment as to what sums should be included in a budget. When\nthe service charge accounts for the year are available, there will be a\nreconciliation between the budgeted and the actual expenditure. Further, any\nchallenge to the quality of the service can only be made at the end of the service\ncharge year.\n54. The Applicants challenge seven items in their Scott Schedule. They indicated\nthat they no longer challenge the figure for pest control (£4.32). The\nRespondent agreed to reduce the sum for communal electricity insurance by\n50% (£105.67).\n55. The remaining sums remain in dispute:\n(i) Gardening: £175.44: The Applicants complain about the quality of the\nservice. Work is sporadic and is not carried out to an acceptable or reasonable\nstandard. The Applicants confirmed that they did not dispute the sum included\nin the budget. When a budget is prepared, it must be assumed that works will\nbe carried out to an acceptable standard. We therefore allow this sum.\n(ii) Smoke Vents/Fire Systems: £183.48: The Applicants state in the Scott\nSchedule that there is no system in place. The Respondent replies that this\nheading covers the emergency lighting system from which each block benefits.\nThis is a 5% uplift on the 2023/24 estimate. We are satisfied that this budget\nsum is reasonable.\n(iii) Tree Surgery: £31.68: The Applicants contend that there are no trees on the\nestate that require surgery. In the Scott Schedule, the Respondent argued that\nthis was only an estimate and there would be a credit if there was no such work.\nAt the hearing, the Respondent took the contrary position. They agreed that this\nsum should be disallowed. If there is any such expenditure, it will be included\nin the final service charge accounts.\n(iv) Audit and Accountancy: £14.40: The Applicants argued that there was no\nrequirement in the lease for the accounts to be audited. The Respondent\nreferred to Clause 7 (5)(c) of the leases. In the light of this, the Applicants did\nnot pursue their challenge.\n18\n\n(v) Property Insurance: £427.68: The Applicants complain that this sum is\nexcessive. The Tribunal has found that the actual expenditure of £259.33 was\nreasonable. Whilst £424.68 had been included in the budget, Ms Kamba stated\nthat after the Section 20 Consultation, the tenants had been informed that the\ninsurance would be in the region of £400. The Tribunal accepts that insurance\npremiums are increasing. However, we are satisfied that the estimate of\n£424.68 was unreasonable. We allow £400.\n56. The Tribunal has made deductions of £162.03 to the budget.\nApplication under s.20C and refund of fees\n57. At the end of the hearing, the Applicants made an application for a refund of\nthe fees that they have paid in respect of these six applications. We understand\nthat they have paid £800, namely 6 application fees of £100 and a hearing fee\nof £200. The Applicants have only succeeded on a small number of points. We\ntherefore make an order that they should be able to recover 25%, namely £200.\n58. In the application form, the Applicants applied for an order under section 20C\nof the 1985 Act in respect of the cost of these proceedings. It is not for this\ntribunal to make a determination as to whether the landlord is entitled under\nthe leases to pass on these costs through the service charge. Section 20C (3)\npermits the Tribunal to make such order as it considers just and equitable in\nthe circumstances. Given our findings, we are satisfied that the Respondent\nshould be restricted to passing on 75% of their costs.\n59. The Respondent has not indicated whether it intends to pass on its costs\nthrough the service charge or as to the level of costs that it would intend to\ncharge to the tenants. The Tribunal records its concern that any such costs\nshould be proportionate. The Respondent has been represented by Counsel\nwith two representatives from her instructing solicitor in attendance. These\ntribunals are intended to be informal and have adopted procedures so that\nparties do not need to be represented. We note that it is always open to the\ntenants to challenge the size of any such costs through a separate application if\nthey consider these to be unreasonable. However, the Respondent is to be\ncommended for the constructive manner in which it has sought to respond to\nthese applications.\n60. The Tribunal also makes an order pursuant to paragraph 5A of Schedule 11 to\nthe Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 restricting the ability of the\nRespondent from charging an administration charge in respect of its litigation\ncosts. However, the Tribunal does not consider that this is strictly necessary, as\nit would not seem to be open to the Respondent to levy such a charge.\nJudge Robert Latham\n29 July 2025\n19\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of appeal they\nmay have.\nIf a Party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), then\na written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nregional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within 28\ndays after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person making the\napplication.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the\n28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide whether to\nallow the application for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the\ntime limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the tribunal to\nwhich it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number), state the grounds\nof appeal and state the result the party making the application is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n20"

The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR24"

The form of remote hearing was coded as\nCVPREMOTE - use for that is held entirely on the Ministry of Justice\nCloud Video Platform with all participants joining from outside the\ncourt. A face-to-face hearing was not held because Judge Korn\ndirected that due to medical grounds given by the respondent’s\nrepresentative.\nDecisions of the Tribunal\n(1) The Tribunal determines that only the sums in respect of the insurance\npremium and lighting of the common parts for the relevant service\ncharge years are payable by the Applicant. Such charges are to be\napportioned as 1/10th of the total insurance premium and 1/5th for\nelectricity charges in accordance with the 4th and 5th Schedule of the\nlease.\n(2) The Tribunal determines that the service charge demands for the\nrelevant years set out in the application are invalid as each demand was\nnot accompanied by a summary of leaseholder’s rights and obligations.\n(3) The respondent can only recover the service charge for valid demands\nthat seek payment from the leaseholder within 18 months of incurring\nthe relevant costs.\n(4) The Tribunal finds that the tenant is unable to offset from any service\ncharges due the costs incurred in connection with works undertaken by\nhis contractors in connection with remedial works to the box valley\ngutter.\n(5) The Tribunal makes an Order under section 20C of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985, so the landlord’s costs, if any, of the Tribunal\nproceedings may not be passed to the lessees through any service\ncharge.\n(6) The Tribunal determines that the Respondent shall pay the Applicant,\nthe full amount that the Applicant paid by way of Application fee and\nHearing fee. This amounting to £200 payable within 28 days of the\nreceipt of decision.\nThe Application\n1. The Applicant seeks a determination pursuant to s.27A of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) , an Order under section 20 C and an\nOrder under Schedule 11 to the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act\n2\n\n2002 (“the 2002 Act”) as to the amount of service charges and\nadministration charges payable by the Applicant in respect of the service\ncharge years of ; 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024.\nBackground\n2. The Tribunal is grateful for the way the parties conducted themselves\nduring the hearing. The hearing was a video hearing and the Applicant\nand Respondent joining remotely via video link.\n3. An Application, was received from the Applicant Alexander Brett Dunwell\non 30 January 2025 in respect of Flat 4, 42 London Road, Croydon CR0\n2TA\n4. Directions were provided by Judge Pittaway of the Tribunal on 17\nFebruary 2025, in the usual terms which set the timeframe for the case\nmanagement.\n5. The case relates to the service and administration charges for Flat 4\nLondon Road, Croydon CRO 2TA. The two-bedroom flat is located on the\nsecond floor and forms part of a three storey Victorian building\nconverted into 5 flats with commercial premises on the ground floor.\n6. The Applicant holds Flat 4, on a long leasehold interest from 27 July 1989,\nwhich requires the landlord to provide services and the tenant to\ncontribute towards their costs by way of a variable service charge. The\nspecific provisions of the lease will be referred to below, where\nappropriate.\n7. It is common ground between the parties that the lease does not provide\nfor the accumulation of a reserve fund to tackle one off large item.\n8. There are service charge arrears at the property which the respondent\nclaims amount to £4,463.09\nThe hearing\n9. The Tribunal was furnished with the Applicant’s revised bundle of 206\npages, and the Respondent’s Case part of which was included in the\naforesaid bundle together with a “Zip File” containing assorted\ndocuments and photographs which were not paginated and therefore\npresented the Tribunal some difficulty during the hearing. Further\nemails were submitted to the Tribunal on the morning of the hearing.\n10. The Respondent failed to comply with paragraph 3 of the Tribunal’s\ndirections insomuch that there were no service charge accounts, invoices\nfrom contractors for building works and cleaning. Only one service\n3\n\ncharge demand was submitted as evidence, which will be considered in\nthis decision. The Respondent also did not comply with paragraph 5 of\nthe Tribunal’s directions – all supporting documents and statements\nwere submitted late on 25 June.\n11. The Applicant, Mr Alexander Brett Dunwell appeared in person, at the\nhearing together with the Respondent Mr Rafee Butt and his\nrepresentative Mr Asim Hussain\n12. Photographs of the building were provided in the respective parties\nhearing bundles. Neither party requested an inspection, and the\nTribunal did not consider that one was necessary, nor would it have been\nproportionate to the issues in dispute.\n13. The Tribunal raised a preliminary issue with the Applicant. In his\napplication Mr Dunwell stated “Yes” in section 7 C: Service charges\ndetermined under the provisions of Schedule 8 to the Building Safety Act\n2022. This flat is contained in a building three storeys in height and\ntherefore the provisions in the Building Safety Act 2022 do not apply.\nThe issues\n14. At the start of the hearing the parties identified the relevant issues for\ndetermination as follows:\n(i) The payability and/or reasonableness of service charges for the\nyears ending; 2021 through to 2025 inclusive.\n(ii) The principal issue for the Tribunal to consider are the remedial\nworks undertaken to the box valley gutter by the Tenant and\nwhether the cost can be “offset” in the service charge account.\n(iii) The apportionment of the relevant service charge items which\ninclude insurance, cleaning costs and works to the fabric of the\nbuilding.\n(iv) Whether the Landlord’s service charge demands are valid.\n(v) The section 20 C Application\n(vi) An Application under Paragraph 5A of Schedule 11\n(vii) Refund of the Application and hearing fees.\nThe Law\n4\n\n15. The law applicable in the present case was limited. It was essentially a\nchallenge to the payability of the sums sought under the lease.\n16. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 S 1 states the following:\n19.-Limitation of service charges: reasonableness\n(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the amount\nof service charge payable for a period-\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the carrying\nout of works, only if the services or works are of a reasonable standard; and\nthe amount payable shall be limited accordingly.\n(2) Where a service charge is payable before the relevant costs are\nincurred, no greater amount than is reasonable is so payable, and after the\nrelevant costs have been incurred any necessary adjustment shall be made by\nrepayment, reduction or subsequent charges or otherwise.\n17. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction to address the issues in s.19 is contained in\ns.27A Landlord and tenant 1985 which states the following:\n27A Liability to pay service charges: jurisdiction\na. An application may be made to [the appropriate tribunal] for a\ndetermination whether a service charge is payable and, if it is, as to -\n(a) the person by whom it is payable.\n(b) the person to whom it is payable,\n(c) the amount which is payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it is payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it is payable.\nb. Subsection (1) applies whether or not any payment has been made.\nc. An application may also be made to [the appropriate tribunal] for\ndetermination whether, if costs were incurred for services, repairs,\n5\n\nmaintenance, improvements, insurance or management of any specified\ndescription, a service charge would be payable for the costs and, if it would,\nas to-\n(a) the person by whom it would be payable\n(b) the person to whom it would be payable\n(c) the amount which would be payable\n(d) the date at or by which it would be payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it would be payable.\nd. No application under subsection (1) or (3) may be made in respect of a\nmatter which-\n(a) has been agreed or admitted by the tenant\n(b) has been, or is to be, referred to arbitration pursuant to a post-\ndispute arbitration agreement to which the tenant is a party,\n(c) has been the subject of determination by a court, or\n(d) has been the subject of determination by an arbitral tribunal\npursuant to a post-dispute arbitration agreement.\n(e) But the tenant is not to be taken to have agreed or admitted any\nmatter by reason only of having made any payment.....\nSection 19 - Limitation of service charges: reasonableness (1) Relevant\ncosts shall be taken into account in determining the amount of a service charge\npayable for a period— (a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred,\nand (b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the carrying\nout of works, only if the services or works are of a reasonable standard; and\nthe amount payable shall be limited accordingly. (2) Where a service charge\nis payable before the relevant costs are incurred, no greater amount than is\nreasonable is so payable, and after the relevant costs have been incurred any\nnecessary adjustment shall be made by repayment, reduction or subsequent\ncharges or otherwise.\nSection 20B – Limitation of service charges: time limit on making\ndemands. (1) If any of the relevant costs taken into account in determining the\namount of any service charge were incurred more than 18 months before a\ndemand for payment of the service charge is served on the tenant, then\n(subject to subsection (2)), the tenant shall not be liable to pay so much of the\nservice charge as reflects the costs so incurred. (2) Subsection (1) shall not\n6\n\napply if, within the period of 18 months beginning with the date when the\nrelevant costs in question were incurred, the tenant was notified in writing\nthat those costs had been incurred and that he would subsequently be required\nunder the terms of his lease to contribute to them by the payment of a service\ncharge.\n(1) The correct apportionment.\n18. The Applicant submits that the apportionment of the service charge is\nclearly set out in the 4th and 5th schedule of the lease.\n19. THE FOURTH SCHEDULE above referred to COSTS EXPENSES\nOUTGOINGS AND MATTERS IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE LESSEE\nIS TO CONTRIBUTE ONE FIFTH.\n1 The expense of maintaining, repairing, redecorating or renewing\nlighting or cleaning the entrance hall staircases, landings and\npassageways which serve solely the flats in the Mansion and of\nproviding any entry phone system.\n20. THE FIFTH SCHEDULE above referred to COSTS EXPENSES\nOUTGOINGS AND MATTERS IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE LESSEE\nIS TO CONTRIBUTE ONE TENTH.\n42.1. 1 the expense of maintaining repairing redecorating and\nrenewing: 42.1.1. (a) the roof Foundations main structure boundary\nwalls and paths the main water tanks gutters and rainwater pipes of\nthe mansion 42.1.2. (b) the gas and water pipes, drains and electric\ncables and wires in under or upon the Mansion and enjoyed or used by\nthe lessee in common with the owners and lessees of the other flats\n42.1.3. (C) the main entrance passage landings and staircases of the\nMansion 42.2.\n2. Such sums (if any) as the lessor may from time to time be called upon\nto pay by way of General and Water Rates in respect of the parts of the\nMansion used in common 42.3.\n3. The cost of decorating the exterior of the Mansion 42.4.\n4. The provision of lighting to the common parts of the Mansion 42.5.\n5. The cost of insurance premiums payable by the lessor for taking out\nand maintaining in force the insurance policy or policies referred to in\nclause 5(e) hereof and such other insurance as the lessor may from time\nto time reasonably deem necessary and desirable. 42.6.\n7\n\n6 The cost of keeping in good and substantial repair the boundary walls\nand fences of the Mansion 42.7.\n7 Any other expenses of a recurring nature which the lessor may deem\nreasonably expedient in the interest of good management. The lessor\nshall be entitled to add to all and any of the above items the\nadministration expenses of the lessor and its managing agents and\nwhere any repairs decorations or renewals are carried out by the lessor\nit shall be entitled to charge as the expenses or costs thereof its normal\ncharges (including profits) in respect of such work.\nThe Decision\n21. The Tribunal determines that service charge demands for the relevant\nyears in the application and forthcoming years must be in accordance\nwith the 4th and 5th schedules in the lease. For example, the Applicant is\nto contribute one tenth of the insurance premium. Alternatively, lighting\nand any cleaning of the common parts is based on a fifth of the relevant\ncost.\n(2) Can the Applicant offset the cost of roof repairs in the service\ncharge and are the Respondent’s alleged roofing works payable.\n22. The Applicant sets out in his evidence a chronological sequence of events\nin connection with defective valley roof gutter. It is claimed that that\nfollowing persistent notifications to the landlord regarding this matter,\nhis requests for repair works were ignored. Things came to a head for the\nApplicant when the ceiling collapsed following excessive leaks to the box\nvalley. The Tribunal were shown photographic evidence in connection\nwith the roof and ceiling following significant water ingress. The\nApplicant confirms that the Respondent undertook repairs to the roof in\nJanuary 2023. However, it is contended that this was an emergency\nrepair and considered inadequate. This is somewhat confirmed by the\nrelatively small cost attributable to these works in the apportioned sum\nof £225. Following considerable discussions and correspondence the\nApplicant was of the opinion he had no option other than to undertake\nthe works himself.\n23. The Applicant consulted Foxtons, his letting agent to inspect the valley\ngutter and prepare a condition report. Following this report the\nApplicant instructed Noah Roofing to undertake repair works during the\nmonths of November 2023-January 2024 at a cost of £2,500. Further\nrepairs were undertaken by MK Constructions in connection with repair\nto the ceiling at a cost of £650.\n24. It is claimed by the Applicant that due to historic neglect, the Respondent\nis in breach of the covenants in the lease and he is now seeking a refund\nor offset the costs incurred in the service charge account.\n8\n\n25. Mr Hussain submits that repairs were undertaken to the roof and valley\ngutter in 2022,2023 and 2024 evidenced by the reicipts provided in his\ndocumentation. It is submitted the Respondent was in constant\ndiscussion with the Applicant in this matter and “tried his best to resolve\nthe issues with the flat roof”. This is evidenced by tw0 receipts for\nroofing works.\n26. For his part, Mr Butt stated that the majority of the roofing works were\nundertaken by his in-house builders, and no charges were made to the\nleaseholders.\n27. Turning to the question of offset/compensation, in his Witness Statement\nMr Dunwell draws the attention of the Tribunal to the Second Schedule\nclause 5 “ The right of the lessees with servants workmen and others at\nall times (except in the case of emergency) to enter into and upon other\nparts of the Mansion for the purposes of repairing maintaining\nrenewing altering or rebuilding the flat or any part of the Mansion\ngiving subjacent or lateral support shelter or protection to the Flats”\n28. The Tribunal considers the roof repairs undertaken by the Applicant\nfollowing significant water ingress and collapse of the ceiling to be\nemergency works and therefore the above clause does not take effect.\n29. Mr Hussain confirms the roof is in the ownership of the Respondent and\nthe Applicant has no rights whatsoever to undertake any repair works.\nThis is evidenced by the following clause in the lease.\n30. Not at any time during the said term to make any alteration in or addition\nto the demised premises or any part thereof nor to cut maim or injure\nany of the walls timbers floors or ceilings thereof or make any\nalteration in the mode or construction of the said premises or the drains\nwatercourses gas or water pipes or the electrical wiring or install any\nheating appliances without first obtaining the previous written consent\nof the Lessor…”\n31. This clause somewhat contradicts the clause 5 in the Second Schedule, but\nclearly supports the fact that Mr Dunwell had no right to carry out any\nworks without the freeholder’s consent, and any repairs or alterations he\nmade are unauthorised and not claimable under the service charge\ndispute.\nThe Decision\n32. The Tribunal having heard from the Respondent and the Applicant in\nrespect of the roofing works determine that the Applicant is unable to\noffset the cost of his roofing works in the service charge account. The\nTribunal agree with the Respondent that the lease states the roof is does\nnot form part of the demise and is the responsibility of the Landlord.\n9\n\n33. Otherwise, an allegation of historic neglect may provide a defence to a\nclaim for service charges if it can be shown that, but for a failure by the\nLandlord to make good a defect at the time required by its covenant, part\nof the cost eventually incurred in remedying that defect, or the whole of\nthe cost of remedying consequential defects, would have been avoided.\nIn those circumstances the tenant to whom the repairing obligation was\nowed has a claim in damages for breach of covenant, and that claim may\nbe set off against the same tenant’s liability to contribute through the\nservice charge to the cost of the remedial works.\n34. In the case of Daejan Properties Ltd v Griffin (2014) UKUT0206 the Upper\nTribunal considered this matter and the issue was whether the work\nwould have cost less (i) If completed earlier and (ii) if it had been\ntendered and contracted as a single programme. The principal issue was\nwhether the remedial works could have been carried out at a lower cost\nif done earlier. In this case, the expert evidence did not support that\nconclusion. It was unlikely that there would have been any significant\nsavings had the work been completed as one project rather than in\nphases. The argument for savings fell away when the need for emergency\nwork was appreciated.\n35. There are comparisons to be drawn from this case, and it is for these\nreasons the Applicant has failed to persuade the Tribunal that the sums\nexpended by him could have been avoided and are therefore not\nrecoverable.\n3. The Insurance\n36. The Tribunal has already confirmed that the appropriate apportionment is\n1/10th of the annual premium. The Tribunal was concerned at the large\nvariance in the recent premiums. In 2023-2024 the premium was\n£3,235.36, 2024-2025: £6,843.15 and in 2025-2026: £1867.81. The\nRespondent could not provide any reasons for the variation, other than\na supposed claim from a leaseholder, but was pleased that the most\nrecent charge is similar to that of 2021.\nDecision\n37. In the absence of any alternative “like for like” quotes provided by the\nApplicant the Tribunal accepts the insurance premiums are payable for\nthe years in question.\n4. Lighting in the common parts\n38. In his evidence the Respondent provided electricity bills for the years in\nquestion. When questioned the Applicant was satisfied this cost was\npayable and to place this in context the charge for 2024-2025 is £48.00.\n10\n\nDecision\n39. The Tribunal determines this cost is payable at 1/5th of the total charge.\nCleaning of the common parts\n40. For all the years in question the Respondent is charging £360 per annum\nat apportionment of 1/5th in accordance with the 4th Schedule of the\nlease.\n41. The Applicant claims the common parts are in poor condition and is not\naware of any cleaning services provided by the Respondent.\n42. Mr Hussain states the common parts are cleaned on a regular basis. There\nare no invoices provided as payment is made in cash.\nDecision\n43. The Tribunal determines that in the absence of any invoices the charge for\ncleaning of the common parts is not payable.\nThe Management Fees\n44. Mr Hussain confirmed the management fee charged by him is £300 per\nunit (£1,500 in total). He confirmed this is a reasonable charge for\nmanagement of a small building. When questioned by the Tribunal, there\nis no management agreement setting out the precise terms of\nmanagement responsibilities and charges.\n45. The Applicant states that there is no real management function in the\nbuilding. Mr Hussain has not provided the leaseholders with a telephone\nnumber, and all discussions and correspondence is with Mr Butt.\nDecision\n46. In the absence of a management agreement with the Respondent, invoices\nfor the management fees and an absence of management activities, the\nTribunal determines that the management fees are not payable for the\nyears in question.\nAre the Service Charge demands valid\n47. The Respondent provided the Tribunal with a copy of one service charge\ndemand titled “Application for Payment on behalf of Mr Rafee Butt”. A\ndemand for a service charge must be accompanied by a summary of the\nleaseholder’s rights and obligations together with the landlord’s details.\n11\n\nIf the summary is missing, the leaseholder is legally entitled to withhold\npayment of the service charge. This requirement is mandated by S153\nCommonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. This can be cured\nretrospectively. In other words, a new demand can be provided with the\nnecessary rights and obligations.\nDecision\n48. The Tribunal determines that based upon the demand provided in the\nbundle of evidence the Service Charge demands are invalid. If and when\nrevised demands are prepared, they will be subject to The Service\nCharges (Summary of Rights and Obligations and Transitional\nProvision) Regulations 2007. In essence, the Respondent can only\nrecover the service charge if he has demanded payment from the\nleaseholder within 18 months of incurring the relevant costs. Therefore,\nas the demands are deemed invalid the Respondent can only recover\nservice charges 18 months from the date of reissue.\nService Charge Accounts\n49. Clause 5G (i) of the lease “ Not later than 30th day of September in each\nyear to produce accounts certified by a qualified accountant detailing\nall expenditure under the fourth schedule here too and all receipts of\ncontributions made under clause 4(ii) of this lease and any provisions\nin the leases of other flats in the mansion for the previous year ending\non the 30th day of September.\nDecision\n50. When questioned by the Tribunal Mr Hussain confirmed that accounts\nhave never been prepared for the building. He stated that this serious\nomission will be rectified in future with accounts to be prepared this year.\nIt is the opinion of the Tribunal that if these were prepared in previous\nyears it would have provided the Applicant a degree of transparency and\nconfidence in the changes being requested.\nLate Fees\n51. The Updated Service Charge Statement Summary prepared by the\nRespondent makes charges for “late fees” which range from £85 (2021-\n2022) to £170 (2022-2023) When questioned, Mr Hussain very\ngenerously is prepared to waive these fees.\n52. Application under s.20C and refund of fees\n12\n\n53. In his application the Applicant made an Application for a refund of the\nfees that he had paid in respect of the Application/ hearing1. The\nTribunal determines that the Respondent should pay the Applicant the\nApplication and Hearing fees in full, which amounts to £200.00, within\n28 days of receipt of the decision. This determination is based upon the\noutcome of this decision.\n54. In the Application form, the Applicant applied for an order under section\n20C of the 1985 Act. The Tribunal determines that it is just and equitable\nin the circumstances, particularly with the perceived lack of explanation\nor transparency, for an Order to be made under section 20C of the 1985\nAct, so that the Respondent may not pass any of its costs incurred in\nconnection with the proceedings before the Tribunal through the service\ncharge.\nDuncan Jagger MRICS 8 August 2025\nRights of appeal\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written Application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe Application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the Application.\nIf the Application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such Application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the Application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe Application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\nApplication is seeking.\n1 The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013\n13"

The form of remote hearing was\nP:PAPERREMOTE, A face-to-face hearing was not held because no-one\nrequested the same, and all issues could be determined on paper. The\ndocuments that the Tribunal were referred to are in a bundle of 305 pages, the\ncontents of which have been noted.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nSummary of the tribunal’s decision\n(1) The appropriate premium payable for freehold is £33,500.00.\nBackground\n1. By an order dated 2 December 2022, this matter was transferred to the\nfirst-tier tribunal by Deputy District Judge Sachdev, sitting at the\nWillesden County Court.\n2. The terms of the order were that-:\n1. “Service of a notice pursuant to section 13 of the Act shall be\ndispensed with\n2. By virtue of section 50 (1) of the Act and this order a new lease shall\nvest in the Claimant on such terms to be determined by the First\nTier Tribunal ( Property Chamber) to be appropriate… as if he had,\nat the date of making the claim, given notice under section 42 of the\nAct of his claim to exercise the right to acquire a new lease of the\nFlat.\n3. The matter shall be transferred to the First Tier Tribunal ( Property\nChamber) for the purpose of determining those terms.\n4. The Claimant shall pay into court( the Court Funds Office) the\nappropriate sum to be determined by the First Tie51(5) of the Act…”\n3. Directions were given by the Tribunal on 11 January 2023 for the\ndetermination of this matter.\n4. The Application, which was received on 5 June 2021, was for a\ndetermination of the premium to be paid under Section 9 of the\nLeasehold Reform Act 1967 (“the Act”) in respect of the Freehold.\n5. The history of this matter was fully set out in the witness statement of\nMr Lloyd Samuel Forster, he set out how he came to purchase the lease\nof the premises which was subject to a 99 year term from 3 February\n1986, he provided details of his demise, and the details of the interest\nowned by the Defendant in the Freehold of “the Block.” He set out that\nthe Block was the semi-detached property in which his flat was\nsituated. He explained that he had never had contact with the\nDefendant. And the efforts that he made to try to locate the defendant\nfreeholder. He established that there were only two Guat Chen in the\nUK one of whom had died on 9 May 2020, and the other who had\n2\n\nchanged their name by marriage to Guat Tam. Despite sending letters\nto the executors of Guat Chen deceased and Guat Tam. Mr Forster\nreceived confirmation that Guat Tam was not the defendant in these\nproceedings. Despite enquires undertaken on his behalf he was was\nunable to locate the freeholder of the premises.\n6. Two public notices were placed to locate the defendant both of which\nwere unsuccessful.\n7. The Tribunal was provided with a statement of Expert Opinion\nprepared by JD Mellor on the instructions of Child and Child Solicitors.\nThe issues are based on te Tribunal’s understanding of the\ndocumentary evidence. The Tribunal derived assistants from the expert\nreport. Mr Mellor set out his understanding of his duty to the Tribunal.\nThe issues\nMatters not in issue\n(a) The subject flat occupies the first floor of the premises which is a\ntwo-storey semi-detached house divided into two flats, each with\nits own front door. The front garden has been converted into\nhard standing, and is not demised to the subject premises, at the\nrear of the premises is a small garden demised to the ground\nfloor.\n(b) The subject flat comprises ground floor entrance and stairs,\nleading to the landing, kitchen reception, bedroom and\nbathroom and separate WC.\n(c) The flat comprises 575 sft. with approximately 40ft being the\nground floor entrance.\n(d) The Tribunal did not carry out an inspect of the premises\nhowever it has taken the description as set out in the report of\nMr JD Mellor.\n(e) The valuation date: 12 May 2022.\n(f) Unexpired term: at the valuation date was 62.73 years.\nThe subject flat is held on a lease dated 3.2.86 for a term of 99\nyears Ground rent is payable at £50/£100/£150 per annum\nrising every 33 years.\nThe Determination\n8. The paper determination took place on 6.04.2023.\n3\n\n9. The Tribunal did not inspect the property as the tribunal did not\nconsider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection to make its\ndetermination.\n10. In his report Mr Mellor set out that Manor Drive is a residential road\noff Wembley Park Drive, in a residential area which is not far from\nWembley Park Stadium and tube station approximately ¼ mile. He\nstated that the premises benefited from a 5 foot share of the garden to\nthe side of the property which was unkempt. He described the property\nas in need of external redecoration, with some roof tiles which had\nslipped.\n11. In respect of the unimproved Freehold Value of the premises, He\nprovided details of five comparable properties which he had considered\nflat 2 a Manor Drive, 62b Wembley Park Drive, 80 Wembley Hill Road\n8 Wayside Court and 2/74 Wembley Park Drive. The sale dates for the\nproperties extended from May 2020 to September 2022.\n12. He explained that he had made the following adjustments, He adjusted\nfor time using the Land Registry House Price Index, for size, which\nincluded adjustments for 1 and 2 bedroom properties which were\nsimilar in respect of square footage, and for the layout of the property.\n13. Mr Mellor also adjusted for condition of the property and outside\nspace, including parking, as given the nearness of the property to\nWembley Stadium this created increased demand on event days. So for\nexample a property with parking was adjusted by £10,000.\n14. He stated that “Taking account of these adjusted comparable sales and\ngiving greater weight to more recent ones, in my view the unimproved\nfreehold value of the subject flat is £277,500.”\nThe Value for the Reversion\n15. In his valuation having looked at the comparable evidence, which is set\nout in his report, he arrived at an unimproved freehold value of\n£277,500 for the first floor flat.\nCapitalisation Rate\n16. Mr Mellor used the capitalisation rate, of 6% which was based on recent\nsettlements and tribunal decisions.\n4\n\nDeferment rate\n17. In his report he referred the Tribunal to the well-known case of Earl\nCardogan -v- Sportelli (2006) Where the Upper Tribunal concluded\n(upheld in the Supreme Court) that the deferment rate for flats and\nMaisonette’s should be 5%. He stated that there was no reason to\ndepart from this rate.\nRelativity\n18. Mr Mellor set out his understanding of the most recent Upper Tribunal\ndecisions on relativity, however in his report he stated that relied soley\non the Savills 2015 graph, as he was not satisfied with the Gerald Eve\ngraph as a result of making enquires with the author as to the\napproach. He arrived at a Relativity for an unexpired lease of 62.73\nyears of 80.1%.\n19. Mr Mellor’s, step by step valuation was set out in the appendix to his\nreport.\nThe tribunal’s determination and Reasons for the tribunal’s\ndetermination\n20. The tribunal considered the report prepared for the Tribunal by Mr\nMellor, however it used its own independent judgment, The Tribunal\nconsidered that his report to be balanced and fair, subject to the\nobservations which the Tribunal makes below.\n21. The Tribunal accepted the capitalisation rate, used by Mr Mellor and\nthe Deferment rate.\n22. The Tribunal has considered the draft lease and the terms set out\nincluding the extension for 189 years from 3 February 1986 and is\nsatisfied with the terms.\n23. In respect of the valuation the Tribunal noted that a number of comparables\nwere used to ascertain the long lease value of the subject flat. The comparables\ninclude transaction dates from May 2020 to July 2020, April 2022, July 2022\nand September 2022.\n24. The tribunal derives most weight from the later comparables , discounting\nthose from 2020. The tribunal on balance agrees with the unimproved freehold\nvalue of the flat of £277,500. In terms of the relativity , the unexpired term of\n5\n\nthe lease is 62.73 years at the valuation date. The applicant’s valuer referred to\nGerald Eve 2016 and Savills 2015 graphs , in respect of the latter the tribunal\nis familiar with the Savills 2016 but not the Savills 2015, it is assumed\nreference was intended to the Savills 2016 graph.\n25. The applicant’s valuer relies on the “Savills 2015” graph, which the tribunal is\ncomfortable with. This providing a relativity of 80.1%. The tribunal confirms\nthe premium for the 90-year lease extension at £33,500. The valuation is at p\n119(paper) of the bundle.\nThe premium\n(2) The tribunal determines the appropriate premium to be £33,500(\nThirty-three thousand five hundred pounds. The total sum to\nbe paid into court for the lease extension subject to\ndeductions for costs is £33,500.\n26.

The Tribunal determines to exercise its discretion to dispense with the\nconsultation requirements provided by Section 20 of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985.\nThe Application\n2. Savills UK Ltd applied on behalf of the Applicant on 30 April 2025 under\nSection 20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (the Act), for\ndispensation from the consultation requirements provided for by Section\n20 of the Act.\n3. The application indicated that the subject of the dispensation application\nwas in relation to supplying and installing a new control panel to the fire\ndamper system and associated works at the Property.\n4. The application explained that the reason that dispensation was sought\nwas because the fire dampers have failed in the closed position preventing\nfresh air supply to the Property. This is causing elevated carbon dioxide\nlevels.\nProcedure\n5. The Tribunal issued directions on 24 June 2025.\n6. In those directions the Tribunal set out that the matter would be\ndetermined on the basis of the papers provided in the week commencing\n1 September 2025.\n7. The directions gave an opportunity for the Respondents to request a\nhearing. No hearing was requested so the matter has proceeded based on\nthe papers provided for the Tribunal.\n8. The directions also provided an opportunity for the Respondents to\nprovide a statement objecting to the application. No responses were\nreceived by the Tribunal.\n9. The Tribunal has considered the written bundle of 178 pages, in support\nof the application.\n2\n\nDetermination\nThe Background\n10. No description of the Property was included in the application, however,\nit appears to be a standalone purpose-built development with commercial\nuse on the lower floors, with 41 flats on the floors above. The Applicant is\nthe Residents Management Company.\n11. As set out in the Tribunal’s directions, Section 20 consultation is not\nrequired or relevant in connection with non-residential premises and the\nfindings of the Tribunal will not affect commercial occupiers in the\nProperty, as the jurisdiction of the Tribunal does not extend to commercial\npremises.\n12. The evidence and submissions of the Applicant is as follows:\ni. The application is for an unconditional dispensation of the\nconsultation requirements prescribed under Section 20 of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 in relation to works to replace the fire\ndamper panel.\nii. Correspondence from Savills’ Asset Engineering team outlining the\ninvestigation of the issue and proposed solution.\niii. Quotations from two companies in the amounts of £10,862.50 +VAT\nand £8,394.10 +VAT in respect of the required works.\niv. Confirmation that a Section 20 consultation process was started, but\ncould not be fully completed due to the urgency of the works.\nv. A chain of correspondence with one leaseholder, notifying them of\nthe Section 20ZA application and answering questions about one of\nthe proposed suppliers. The leaseholder states that they are not\nopposing the appointment of the proposed supplier.\n13. In accordance with Tribunal directions, the Applicant notified\nleaseholders of the Section 20ZA application, including how to respond.\nNo responses from leaseholders were received by the Tribunal. The\nApplicant has also confirmed that it received no objections.\nThe Law\n14. The Tribunal is being asked to exercise its discretion under Section 20ZA\nof the Act. The wording of Section 20ZA, subsection (1) provides:\n3\n\n‘Where an application is made to a leasehold valuation tribunal for\ndetermination to dispense with all or any of the consultation requirements\nin relation to any qualifying works or qualifying long term agreements, the\ntribunal may make the determination if satisfied that it is reasonable\nto dispense with the requirements’.\n15. The Supreme Court in the case of Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson\n[2013] UKSC 14 (Daejan) is the leading authority on how the statutory\nprovisions are to be interpreted.\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n16. The Tribunal determines to grant the application.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n17. The statement from the Applicant explains the reasons the works needed\nto be actioned quickly without the time afforded by a full Section 20\nconsultation.\n18. No objections were received from leaseholders.\n19. The Tribunal therefore determines that it is reasonable to grant the\napplication sought.\n20. Both parties should note that this determination does not\nconcern the issue of whether the service charge costs demanded\nin connection with the works to the fire damper system are\nreasonable or indeed payable. The Respondents are able, if it\nappears to them to be appropriate, to make an application\nunder Section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 as to\nreasonableness and payability.\nName: S Beckwith MRICS Date: 5 September 2025\n4\n\nRights of Appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n5"

The Respondent was represented at the\nhearing by Alexander Bisset of Counsel, but he had no instructions on\nany of the issues in dispute and was unable to enlighten the tribunal as\nto why the Respondent had not made any written submissions. Nobody\nfrom Assethold Limited or from its managing agents Eagerstates\nLimited attended the hearing.\n5. The Applicants said at the hearing, having already stated this in written\nsubmissions, that they and the Respondent had agreed to mediation\nand that a date for that mediation had been set but that – without\nwarning or explanation – the Respondent had simply not attended the\nmediation.\nApplicants’ case\n6. The Applicants’ case is contained partly in the application itself but it is\nexpanded upon in the ‘Scott’ Schedule that they have prepared and is\nsupplemented by various other items in the hearing bundle including\nalternative quotes, copy accounts, copy correspondence, copies of\nleases and other miscellaneous items. To avoid duplication, we will\n3\n\nleave any comments on the material provided by the Applicants to be\naddressed in the section of this determination headed “Discussion of\ndisputed costs at hearing and tribunal’s analysis”.\nRespondent’s case\n7. As noted above, the Respondent has not submitted a statement of case.\nDiscussion of disputed costs at hearing and tribunal’s analysis\nFire, health and safety risk assessment 2023/24\n8. The Applicants’ position is that the extent of the common parts of the\nProperty is very limited, as shown on the photographs in the hearing\nbundle, and that the charge is disproportionate. In addition, they do\nnot believe that the work was carried out at all, hence their statement\nthat they are not willing to pay anything, although the tribunal pointed\nout at the hearing that this does not form part of their written case.\n9. The Applicants also argued at the hearing that this item is not covered\nby their leases but Mr Bisset for the Respondent disagreed on this\npoint. Paragraph 1 of Part 2 of Schedule 7 to the leases defines the\n“Service Costs” as including (in paragraph 1(a)(iv)) “[all of the costs\nreasonably and properly incurred of] … complying with all laws\nrelating to the Retained Parts” and the carrying out of a fire, health and\nsafety risk assessment (at appropriate intervals) is a legal requirement.\nWe therefore agree with Mr Bisset on this point.\n10. After some discussion, having noted the tribunal’s provisional view on\nwhether this item is covered by the leases, the Applicants proposed a\nfigure of £200.00. Mr Bisset for the Respondent did not object but said\nthat he did not have instructions that would enable him to accept the\n£200.00 offered by the Applicants.\n11. We note the evidence provided by the Applicants which has not been\ncountered by the Respondent. We agree that the common parts of the\nProperty appear to be very small and that £420.60 would appear to be\na high charge for the work done (if indeed it was done). In the absence\nof any alternative figure and on the additional basis that £200.00\nseems a reasonable amount in the circumstances we determine that\nonly £200.00 is payable.\nPreventative Maintenance Schedule and Survey for insurance purposes\n2023/24\n12. The aggregate charge for these items is £3,600.00. The Applicants\nstate that they consider the charge to be too high, and they have\n4\n\nreferred the tribunal to their alternative quote of £1,500 + VAT. They\nalso feel that it was premature to carry out an insurance survey as the\nProperty was only redeveloped in 2019 and they also submit that\nneither of these items is covered by their leases, but at the hearing Mr\nBisset for the Respondent disagreed on this point.\n13. We do not accept the Applicants’ submission that these items are not\ncovered by the leases. In relation to the preventative maintenance\nschedule, the service charge contains standard provisions covering the\nrecovery of the cost of repair and maintenance of the Property, and in\nour view preparing a preventative maintenance schedule (at\nappropriate intervals) is a proper part of the process of carrying out\nrepairs and maintenance in a prudent and professional manner. Also,\nthe leases allow the landlord to charge for “any other service … that the\nLandlord may in its reasonable discretion … provide for the benefit of\ntenants and occupiers …”. In our view this is wide enough to cover this\nhead of charge.\n14. In relation to the insurance survey, the tenant under each of the leases\ncovenants to pay the “Insurance Rent” which is defined as including (in\naddition to the insurance premium itself) “any fees and other expenses\nthat the Landlord reasonably incurs, in effecting and maintaining\ninsurance of the Building in accordance with its obligations in\nparagraph 2 of Schedule 6 including any professional fees for\ncarrying out any insurance valuation of the Reinstatement Cost”. In\nour view this is wide enough to cover this head of charge.\n15. Therefore, we are satisfied that a reasonable sum in respect of both of\nthese heads of charge is recoverable under the leases.\n16. As for the reasonableness of the cost itself, we note the alternative\nquotation for £1,500 + VAT which has not been challenged by the\nRespondent, and in the absence of any better evidence we determine\nthat the aggregate of these charges should be reduced to £1,500 +\nVAT (i.e. £1,800.00).\nCommon parts electricity 2023/24\n17. The Applicants state that the Respondent incurred late payment\ncharges and they do not think that these should be passed on to\nleaseholders. At the hearing the Applicants were only able to provide\none example of a penalty charge in the hearing bundle (for £10.00), and\nafter some discussion they said that they would be prepared to agree to\nall but £10.00 of this charge.\n18. In the absence of any explanation from the Respondent as to why the\n£10.00 penalty charge should be passed on to leaseholders we agree\n5\n\nwith the Applicants that it should not be, and accordingly the charge\nis reduced from £481.48 to £471.48.\nFire, health and safety repairs 2023/24\n19. On the basis of the information provided by the Applicants, the charge\nof £432.00 comprises £144.00 for putting up a poster and some fire\nsafety stickers and £288.00 for monthly servicing. In relation to the\nsum of £144.00, the Applicants argue that this is too high a charge just\nfor putting up a poster and some fire safety stickers. In relation to the\nsum of £288.00, the Applicants state that no monthly servicing has\nbeen carried out.\n20. We do not accept the Applicants’ position in relation to the charge of\n£144.00. Even something as simple as putting up a poster and some\nfire safety stickers involves labour in addition to the materials and is\nlikely to have involved some travel time, and the sum of £144.00 does\nnot seem unreasonable. In relation to the charge of £288.00, the\nApplicants state that the service was not provided and the Respondent\nhas not countered this, and therefore on the evidence before us we\nconsider that the charge is not payable. Therefore, the aggregate charge\nis reduced from £432.00 to £144.00.\nKey cutting 2023/24\n21. The Applicants have referred the tribunal to correspondence in the\nhearing bundle in which the Respondent stated that leaseholders would\nnot be charged for the key cutting in question. There is also no\nevidence before us to indicate that the circumstances were such that the\nApplicants should have been charged for the key cutting. Accordingly,\nthis sum is not payable at all.\nAccounting fee 2023/24\n22. The Applicants said at the hearing that the accounts contained many\nerrors, although when asked to identify these errors they were only able\nto offer a couple of examples. The Applicants also said that the\nRespondent had failed to provide information about the sinking fund,\nhad not explained why certain costs were divided three ways rather\nthan four ways and had also attempted to charge leaseholders in\nrespect of the period after the leaseholders had acquired the right to\nmanage.\n23. As noted at the hearing, accounting mistakes sometimes occur, and in\nour view if those mistakes are few in number and/or are not major\nerrors then the existence of such errors do not by themselves\ndemonstrate that the accounting has been sub-standard such that a\nreduction in the fee is warranted. As for the other points raised by the\n6\n\nApplicants, in our view these are management failings rather than\naccounting failings (to the extent that the points are valid ones).\n24. Therefore, in the absence of any other basis for the challenge, this\ncharge is payable in full.\nManagement fee 2023/24\n25. The Applicants have expressed a number of different concerns about\nthe quality of management. These include the erroneous charge for key\ncutting, accounting errors, incurring a penalty charge for late payment\nof the electricity bill, failure to notify leaseholders when sending people\n(such as contractors) over to the Property, selective and unhelpful\nresponses to legitimate queries and frequent use of a threatening tone\nwhen responding to concerns or requests for information. The\nApplicants referred the tribunal to examples of email correspondence\nfrom the Respondent’s staff. Mr Bisset for the Respondent said that,\nwhatever the Applicants’ concerns on the above points, it was clear that\nvarious services had been provided.\n26. We accept that the Applicants have identified various management\nfailings and that the Respondent has not offered any rebuttal within\nthese proceedings. However, the tone in the correspondence to which\nwe were referred and which related to the provision of information,\nwhilst not especially polite, is consistent with the belief (if genuinely\nheld) that the information had already been supplied. In addition, we\nnote that the Respondent kept the Property insured and carried out\nvarious other management services, albeit imperfectly at times as per\nthe Applicants’ observations.\n27. Taking the management performance as a whole, we consider that it\nwould be appropriate to reduce the fee significantly whilst keeping it at\na level which recognises the work that has been done, and accordingly\nthe fee is reduced from £1,200.00 to £850.00.\nBuilding insurance premium 2023/24\n28. The Applicants were previously paying £1,084.00 and felt that the\nincrease to £1,526.40 was excessive. They have proposed a figure of\n£1,084.00 plus one year’s inflation based on the Consumer Price Index\n(“CPI”).\n29. The Respondent has not challenged the Applicants’ alternative figure\nand Mr Bisset conceded at the hearing that their figure was not\nmanifestly unreasonable. The Applicants’ proposed figure is therefore\neffectively uncontested and is not obviously unreasonable, and\ntherefore the premium is reduced from £1,526.40 to £1,084.00 + CPI.\nIn the absence of any better information and as the service charge year\n7\n\napparently runs from April to March we will use the change in the CPI\nbetween April 2022 and March 2023. In April 2022 to CPI figure was\n116.5 and in March 2023 it was 126.8, an increase of 8.84%. Therefore,\nthe premium should be £1,084.00 x 108.84% = £1,179.83.\nVAT 2023/24\n30. The leases define the “Service Costs” (which form the basis of the\nservice charges) as including “any VAT payable by the Landlord in\nrespect of any of the items mentioned above [i.e. the various listed\nservice charge items] except to the extent that the Landlord is able to\nrecover such VAT”. The Applicants argue that the Respondent was\nable to recover the VAT on services provided to it, but they do not have\nany proof of this point; merely a working assumption that this is the\ncase.\n31. In any event, clause 17 of the leases reads as follows: “Any obligation to\npay money refers to a sum exclusive of VAT and the amount of any\nVAT payable in addition (whether by the Landlord or by the Tenant)\nshall be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord”. It would seem therefore\nthat the relevant tenant/leaseholder covenants to pay all VAT, and\ntherefore in our view any VAT on the service charge is payable by the\nrelevant tenant/leaseholder. Therefore, the Applicants’ challenge\nto the VAT element of the various service charges is rejected.\nSecure loose wires and down pipe\n32. The Applicants argue that the charge of £300.00 for securing loose\nwires and the down pipe was disproportionate, and they have obtained\nan alternative quotation of £65.00 + VAT which is in the hearing\nbundle. They also express the view that the work was not done at all,\nbut this point does not form part of their statement of case.\n33. The Applicants’ alternative quotation has not been challenged by the\nRespondent.\n34. We do not accept the Applicants’ submission that the work was not\ndone at all as this submission has not been put to the Respondent and\ntherefore the Respondent has not had an opportunity to counter it.\nHowever, we do accept the Applicants’ alternative quotation as it has\nbeen provided to the Respondent and has not been challenged.\n35. Accordingly, the charge is reduced from £300.00 to £65.00 +\nVAT (total £78.00).\n8\n\nFlat 1, Flat 2 and Flat 3 outstanding balances allegedly owed from before\n2023/24\n36. The leaseholders of Flat 1, Flat 2 and Flat 3 state that they received\nfrom the Respondent a demand for an alleged balance of service\ncharges payable to the previous landlord. However, when they queried\nthe payability of the alleged balance they did not receive a satisfactory\nresponse from the Respondent. There is also no end of year service\ncharge certificate and no breakdown has been provided.\n37. The Respondent has made no attempt in the course of these\nproceedings or seemingly otherwise to justify or even explain these\ncharges and in the circumstances none of these charges is payable.\nGutter cleaning 2024/25\n38. The Applicants’ evidence is that this did not take place, that they would\nhave noticed if it had taken place because many of them work from\nhome and that the relevant Applicant would need to be notified in order\nfor the contractor to gain access.\n39. The Respondent has not countered the Applicants’ evidence and\ntherefore based on the evidence before us we are satisfied that the\nservice was not provided and therefore that this charge is not\npayable at all.\nDrain services 2024/25\n40. The Applicants’ evidence is that this did not take place, that they would\nhave noticed if it had taken place because many of them work from\nhome and that the relevant drain is not accessible without the\npermission of the relevant Applicant.\n41. The Respondent has not countered the Applicants’ evidence and\ntherefore based on the evidence before us we are satisfied that the\nservice was not provided and therefore that this charge is not\npayable at all.\nFire, health and safety risk assessment 2024/25\n42. The Applicants state that the Respondent has charged them for a fire,\nhealth and safety risk assessment for two consecutive years (2023/24\nand 2024/25) and the Applicants dispute that this is an annual\nrequirement.\n43. The Respondent has not countered the Applicants’ arguments, and we\nagree that in the absence of any specific compelling justification a\n9\n\nlandlord should not be carrying out such an assessment in consecutive\nyears. In our view it also leads to concerns as to what the Respondent’s\nmotivation was for arranging assessments in two consecutive years,\nassuming that those assessments both took place. In any event, as it is\nnot reasonable to carry out assessments in consecutive years it is not\nreasonable to charge leaseholders for the second assessment, and\naccordingly this charge is not payable at all.\nCommon parts electricity 2024/25\n44. The Applicants state that the service charge year started at the\nbeginning of April 2024 and that the RTM company acquired the right\nto manage the Property at the beginning of October 2024, therefore\nthey should only be charged for those first 6 months of the service\ncharge year (i.e. for half of the year). They should therefore only pay\n50% of the total charge of £700.00.\n45. The Respondent has offered no challenge to this analysis and in the\nabsence of any competing arguments we agree with it. The figure of\n£700.00 is considerably higher than the figure for 2023/24 and so\nthere is also no reason to think that it just relates to the first 6 months.\nThe period between the beginning of the service charge year and the\ndate on which the right to manage was acquired is not exactly 6\nmonths, but the Applicants and Mr Bisset for the Respondent\nconfirmed that it was close enough that they were content for the\ntribunal to treat this period as being 6 months for this and any other\nrelevant apportionment purposes.\n46. According, to reflect the fact that the service was only provided for 50%\nof the year, the charge is reduced from £700.00 to £350.00.\nRepair fund 2024/25\n47. Leaseholders had been asked to contribute £2,000.00 between them to\nwhat the Respondent had described as a ‘repair fund’. When one of the\nApplicants asked the Respondent how this differed from a ‘reserve\nfund’ he was told by Ronni Gurvits that “a reserve fund accumulates\nfrom year to year, whilst this is refunded at the end of any accounting\nyear if not spent”. The Applicants state that the money was not spent\nand therefore that it should have been (and should still be) returned to\nleaseholders.\n48. We note that the Applicants’ challenge is not to the payability of the\ncontribution to the repair fund. Instead, they state that it should now\nbe returned to them as it has not been spent. As this is not a challenge\nto payability it is not open to the tribunal to determine that it was not\npayable. In addition, the tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to\norder its repayment, and in any event it is not clear that this sum would\n10\n\nbe repayable to individual leaseholders. It is arguable that – if the\nmoney has not been spent – it constitutes uncommitted service\ncharges, in which case the Applicants may wish to take legal advice as\nto whether it is transferable to the RTM company. However, on the\nbasis of the evidence before us the repair fund contribution is\npayable in full and is not refundable to individual\nleaseholders.\nElectric cupboard charge 2024/25\n49. The Applicants’ evidence is that this did not take place, and they have\nprovided copy photographs which they say show that nothing has\nchanged.\n50. The Respondent has not countered the Applicants’ evidence and\ntherefore based on the evidence before us we are satisfied that the\nservice was not provided and therefore that this charge is not\npayable at all.\nBuilding insurance premium 2024/25\n51. The Applicants were paying £1,084.00 in 2022/23 and feel that the\nincrease to £1,526.40 in 2023/24 and then to £1,602.72 in 2024/25 is\nexcessive. They propose a figure for 2024/25 of £1,084.00 plus two\nyears’ inflation based on the CPI.\n52. The Respondent has not challenged the Applicants’ alternative figure\nand Mr Bisset conceded at the hearing that their figure was not\nmanifestly unreasonable. The Applicants’ proposed figure is therefore\neffectively uncontested and is not obviously unreasonable, and\ntherefore the premium is reduced from £1,602.72 to £1,084.00 + two\nyears’ CPI. In the absence of any better information and as the service\ncharge year apparently runs from April to March we will use the change\nin the CPI between April 2022 and March 2024. In April 2022 the CPI\nfigure was 116.5 and in March 2024 it was 131.6, an increase of 12.96%.\nTherefore, the premium should be £1,084.00 x 112.96% = £1,224.49.\nFire, health and safety testing, services and repairs 2024/25\n53. The Applicants’ evidence is that this did not take place.\n54. The Respondent has not countered the Applicants’ evidence and\ntherefore based on the evidence before us we are satisfied that the\nservice was not provided and therefore that this charge is not\npayable at all.\n11\n\nAccounting fee 2024/25\n55. Again, the Applicants state that the service charge year started at the\nbeginning of April 2024 and that the RTM company acquired the right\nto manage the Property at the beginning of October 2024 and so should\nonly be charged for those first 6 months of the service charge year (i.e.\nfor half of the year). They should therefore only pay 50% of the total\ncharge of £450.00.\n56. The Respondent has offered no challenge to this analysis and in the\nabsence of any competing arguments we agree with it. Accordingly, the\ncharge is reduced from £450.00 to £225.00.\nManagement fee 2024/25\n57. For similar reasons as for 2023/24 the Applicants argue that the\nmanagement service was poor and that the fee should be reduced\nsubstantially. They also argue – as with the accounting fee and the\ncommon parts electricity charges – that the service was only provided\nfor half a year.\n58. Based on the evidence provided by the Applicants, we agree that the\nmanagement has been poor. Many but not all of the same arguments as\nwere employed by the Applicants in respect of 2023/24 (see above)\napply here, and in addition there is the Respondent’s unco-operative\nbehaviour in relation to the handover to the RTM company. The\nRespondent has not countered any of the Applicants’ arguments.\nHowever, for the same reasons as we have given in relation to 2023/24,\nwe do not agree with the Applicants that the fee should be reduced\nquite so drastically to reflect poor management and therefore, subject\nto the point made below, we again consider that the fee should be\nreduced to £850.00.\n59. However, the Applicants also argue that the service was only provided\nfor half a year. In the absence of any arguments from the Respondent\nwe agree with the Applicants’ analysis, and therefore the\nmanagement fee is further reduced by 50% to £425.00.\nVAT 2024/25\n60. For the same reasons as for 2023/24 the Applicants’ challenge to\nthe VAT element of the various service charges is rejected.\n12\n\nPumps charge 2024/25\n61. The Applicants’ evidence is that this did not take place, and at the\nhearing they referred the tribunal to correspondence in the hearing\nbundle which indicated that the work had not been done.\n62. The Respondent has not countered the Applicants’ evidence and\ntherefore based on the evidence before us we are satisfied that the\nservice was not provided and therefore that this charge is not\npayable at all.\nCosts\n63. The Applicants have applied for (a) a cost order under section 20C of\nthe 1985 Act (“Section 20C”), (b) a cost order under paragraph 5A of\nSchedule 11 to CLARA (“Paragraph 5A”) and (c) an order for the\nreimbursement of the application and hearing fees pursuant to\nparagraph 13(2) of the Tribunal Rules.\n64. The relevant parts of Section 20C read as follows: (1) “A tenant may\nmake an application for an order that all or any of the costs incurred,\nor to be incurred, by the landlord in connection with proceedings\nbefore … the First-tier Tribunal … are not to be regarded as relevant\ncosts to be taken into account in determining the amount of any\nservice charge payable by the tenant …”.\n65. The relevant parts of Paragraph 5A read as follows: “A tenant of a\ndwelling in England may apply to the relevant … tribunal for an order\nreducing or extinguishing the tenant’s liability to pay a particular\nadministration charge in respect of litigation costs”.\n66. The Section 20C application is therefore an application for an order\nthat the whole or part of the costs incurred by the landlord in\nconnection with these proceedings cannot be added to the service\ncharge. The Paragraph 5A application is an application for an order\nthat the whole or part of the costs incurred by the landlord in\nconnection with these proceedings cannot be charged direct to the\nApplicant as an administration charge under his lease.\n67. The Applicants’ main application has been largely successful, and the\nRespondent’s only engagement with these proceedings (except in\nrelation to an early procedural point) has been to send a barrister to the\nhearing but without giving him any instructions. In the circumstances\nit is appropriate to make a Section 20C Order that all of the costs\nincurred by the Respondent in connection with these proceedings are\nnot to be regarded as relevant costs to be taken into account in\ndetermining the amount of any service charge payable by the\nApplicants. For the same reasons it is appropriate to make a Paragraph\n13\n\n5A Order extinguishing the Applicants’ liability to pay all of the costs\nincurred by the Respondent in connection with these proceedings.\nAccordingly, we hereby make both of these Orders.\n68. The relevant part of paragraph 13(2) of the Tribunal Rules reads as\nfollows: “The Tribunal may make an order requiring a party to\nreimburse to any other party the whole or part of the amount of any\nfee paid by the other party which has not been remitted by the Lord\nChancellor”. Again, the Applicants’ main application has been largely\nsuccessful and the Respondent has hardly engaged with these\nproceedings, and therefore it is appropriate to make an order requiring\nthe Respondent to reimburse to the Applicants the application fee and\nhearing fee (£300.00 in aggregate). Accordingly, we hereby make this\nOrder as well.\nName: Judge P Korn Date: 30 June 2025\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\nA. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office dealing with the case.\nB. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional\noffice within 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the\ndecision to the person making the application.\nC. If the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for extension of time and the reason\nfor not complying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will then\nlook at such reason and decide whether to allow the application for\npermission to appeal to proceed despite not being within the time limit.\nD. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the\ncase number), state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\n14\n\nAPPENDIX 1\nList of Applicants\nMatt Frankham and Keeshia Briscoe (former leaseholders of Flat 1, 192 High\nStreet)\nCamille Joron Crooson (current leaseholders of Flat 1, 192 High Street)\nNathan Edwards (leaseholder of Flat 2, 192 High Street)\nSally Ann Watson (leaseholder of Flat 3, 192 High Street)\nCallum Hillan (leaseholder of 192A High Street)\n15\n\nAPPENDIX 2\nAppendix of relevant legislation\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 (as amended)\nSection 18\n(1) In the following provisions of this Act \"service charge\" means an\namount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to\nthe rent -\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements or insurance or the landlord's\ncosts of management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to\nthe relevant costs.\n(2) The relevant costs are the costs or estimated costs incurred or to be\nincurred by or on behalf of the landlord, or a superior landlord, in\nconnection with the matters for which the service charge is payable.\n(3) For this purpose -\n(a) \"costs\" includes overheads, and\n(b) costs are relevant costs in relation to a service charge\nwhether they are incurred, or to be incurred, in the period\nfor which the service charge is payable or in an earlier or\nlater period.\nSection 19\n(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the\namount of a service charge payable for a period -\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provisions of services or the\ncarrying out of works, only if the services or works are of a\nreasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.\n(2) Where a service charge is payable before the relevant costs are\nincurred, no greater amount than is reasonable is so payable, and\nafter the relevant costs have been incurred any necessary\nadjustment shall be made by repayment, reduction or subsequent\ncharges or otherwise.\nSection 27A\n(1) An application may be made to the appropriate tribunal for a\ndetermination whether a service charge is payable and, if it is, as to\n-\n(a) the person by whom it is payable,\n16\n\n(b) the person to whom it is payable,\n(c) the amount which is payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it is payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it is payable.\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not any payment has been made.\n(3) An application may also be made to the appropriate tribunal for a\ndetermination whether, if costs were incurred for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements, insurance or management of any\nspecified description, a service charge would be payable for the\ncosts and, if it would, as to -\n(a) the person by whom it would be payable,\n(b) the person to whom it would be payable,\n(c) the amount which would be payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it would be payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it would be payable.\n(4) No application under subsection (1) or (3) may be made in respect\nof a matter which -\n(a) has been agreed or admitted by the tenant,\n(b) has been, or is to be, referred to arbitration pursuant to a\npost-dispute arbitration agreement to which the tenant is a\nparty,\n(c) has been the subject of determination by a court, or\n(d) has been the subject of determination by an arbitral tribunal\npursuant to a post-dispute arbitration agreement.\n(5) But the tenant is not to be taken to have agreed or admitted any\nmatter by reason only of having made any payment\n(6) An agreement by the tenant of a dwelling … is void in so far as it\npurports to provide for a determination – (a) in a particular\nmanner, or (b) on particular evidence.\n17"

For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR24"

The fair rent determined by the Tribunal for the purposes of Section 70 was\n£118.00 per week, including services of £6.53 per week, with effect from 4\nNovember 2021.\nBACKGROUND\n2. On 11 March 2021, the Rent Officer registered a rental of £118.00 per week,\nincluding services of £6.53 per week, in respect of the Property, effective from 12\nApril 2021. The rent prior to this registration was £112.00 per week, including\nservices of £1.83 per week registered on 4 March 2019.\n3. By a letter received by the Valuation Office dated 23 May 2021, the Tenant\nobjected to the rent determined by the Rent Officer. With the agreement of the\nLandlord, the late objection was accepted, and the matter was referred to the\nTribunal.\n4. A copy of the tenancy agreement dated 29 February 1980 was included within\nthe parties’ submissions.\nTHE PROPERTY\n5. The Tribunal were unable to carry out an inspection of the Property.\n6. From the information available to The Tribunal and provided by the parties, the\nProperty comprises a modern end terraced house situated in the town of\nLeamington Spa.\n7. The accommodation (arranged over 3 storeys) comprises the following:\nGround Floor garage, kitchen, cloakroom;\nFirst Floor lounge, one bedroom;\nSecond Floor two bedrooms, bathroom, Separate WC.\n8. The Property benefits from central heating and double glazing.\n9. Ms Fisher advised that the Property was, with the exception of the back gate, was\nin reasonable repair.\nSubmissions of the Parties\n10. The Tribunal held a hearing by video platform on the 4 November 2021.\nParticipants in the hearing were the Tenant, Ms Elizabeth Fisher who was\nsupported by Mr Chris Allen, and behalf of the Landlord were Mr Guy Butler\nPage 2 of 6\n\n(Service Charge and Rent Compliance Officer) and Mr Tristan Hopper (Service\nCharge Operations Manager).\n11. The Tribunal explained at the outset of the hearing that in this matter, that the\nTribunal’s jurisdiction in this matter would be to consider the rent registered by\nthe Rent Officer and either to confirm or adjust the same. It was further explained\nthat the rent and service charge (believed to be a fixed service charge) would be\nconsidered as a whole and not as individual items.\n12. The principal issue as far as Ms Fisher was concerned was the service charge\nelement of the rent which the Tribunal noted in the 2019 registration was £1.83\nper week but in the 2021 registration had risen to £6.53 per week. Ms Fisher was\ntold by her landlord earlier in the year that the rise in the amount she paid would\nincrease by approximately 1.5% in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n13. In response, Mr Butler said that the CPI increase relates to the rental element\nalone and the service charge is not so limited. Mr Butler further confirmed that\nthe total amount sought by the Landlord from April 2021 was in total £100.60\nper week made up of rent of £94.07 per week and service charges of £6.53 per\nweek\n14. It was pointed out by Mr Allen that clause 2 (2) of the lease stated as follows:\n2. (1) The rent in respect of the premises unless and until varied as hereinafter\nprovided shall be the amount set out in the Second Schedule which amount\nincludes a sum for services provided by the Landlord in pursuance of his\nobligations under this Agreement.\nIn the opinion of Ms Fisher and Mr Allen, this therefore indicated that the total\namount i.e. the rent and service charge amount should increase by no more than\n1.5%.\n15. A further issue noted by Ms Fisher was that an element of the service charge was\nfor the removal of fly tipped rubbish which she considered unreasonable as the\nLocal Authority were removing the same and as she was paying Council Tax, she\nwas effectively being charged twice. On behalf of the Landlord, Mr Hopper\nexplained that the Local Authority would only remove waste from adopted areas\nin their control. Ms Fisher said that this was not the case and she had seen Local\nAuthority workmen removing waste from the communal areas of the\ndevelopment. Mr Hopper offered to provide Ms Fisher with a map indicating the\nextent of Orbit’s responsibility in relation to the development in which the\nProperty is situated.\nPage 3 of 6\n\n16. Ms Fisher also provided a copy of a local circular which indicated that the\nmaintenance of local public areas had been delayed which had raised concerns\namongst residents.\nTHE LAW\n17. When determining a fair rent, the Tribunal, in accordance with the Rent Act 1977,\nSection 70, had regard to all the circumstances including the age, location and\nstate of repair of the Property. It also disregarded the effect of (a) any relevant\nTenant’s improvements and (b) the effect of any disrepair or other defect\nattributable to the Tenant or any predecessor in title under the Regulated\nTenancy, on the rental value of the property.\n18. In Spath Holme Limited v Chairman of the Greater Manchester, etc. Committee\n[1995] 28HLR107 and Curtis v London Rent Assessment Committee [1999]\nQB92, the Court of Appeal emphasised (a) that ordinarily a fair rent is the market\nrent for the property discounted for ‘scarcity’ (i.e. that element, if any, of the\nmarket rent, that is attributable to there being a significant shortage of similar\nproperties in the wider locality available for letting on similar terms – other than\nas to rent – to that of the regulated tenancy) and (b) that for the purposes of\ndetermining the market rent assured tenancy (market) rents were usually\nappropriate comparables. (These rents may have to be adjusted where necessary\nto reflect any relevant differences between those comparables and the subject\nproperty).\nVALUATION\n19. As indicated above, section 70 of the Rent Act 1977 sets out the criteria by which\nthe Tribunal should determine the rent. In addition, the Rent Acts (Maximum\nFair Rent) Order 1999 limits the increase permitted to the increase in the Retail\nPrices Index plus a factor of 5% from the rent previously registered by the Rent\nOfficer which in this matter was £112.00 per week, including services of £1.83\nper week.\n20. The Tribunal notes the discussion between the parties with regard to a CPI\nincrease of 1.5% and also that the rent is not so limited in the tenancy agreement.\nThis is not therefore a determinant in the Tribunal’s determination of the rent.\n21. In the first instance, the Tribunal determined what rent the Landlord could\nreasonably expect to obtain for the Property in the open market if it were let today\nin the condition that is considered usual for such open market lettings. It did this\nfrom its own general knowledge of market rent levels in the Leamington Spa area.\nHaving done so, it concluded that such a likely market rent would be £175.00 per\nweek. Due to issues locally with regard to fly tipping and poorly maintained\npublic realm, the Tribunal made a deduction of £15.00 per week.\nPage 4 of 6\n\n22. To allow for the Tenant’s decorating liability, it was necessary to make an\nadditional deduction of £10.00 per week and a further adjustment of £18.00 was\nmade to allow for the Tenant’s fittings (floor coverings, curtains and white\ngoods).\n23. The Tribunal then considered the question of scarcity. This was done by\nconsidering whether the number of persons genuinely seeking to become tenants\nof similar properties in the wider area of the Warwickshire on the same terms\nother than rent is substantially greater than the availability of such dwellings as\nrequired by section 70(2) of the Rent Act 1977.\n24. The Tribunal finds that many landlords dispute that scarcity exists because they\nare of the opinion that the market is ‘in balance’. Although tenants do not in all\ncases have difficulty in finding accommodation, this ignores the fact that it is the\nprice of such accommodation which creates a balance in the market. Section\n70(2) specifically excludes the price of accommodation from consideration in\ndetermining whether there are more persons genuinely seeking to become\ntenants of similar properties than there are properties available. Although the\nrental market for Assured Shorthold properties may be in balance, many\npotential tenants may be excluded from it for various reasons such as age, poor\ncredit history or because they are on housing benefit.\n25. The Tribunal found that there was scarcity and, accordingly, made a further\ndeduction of £14.00 per week.\n26. The Tribunal therefore determined that the fair rent for the Property was\ntherefore £118.00 per week to include service charges of £6.53 per week.\n27. The maximum fair rent permitted by the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order\n1999 is £127.00 to include £6.53 service charges. The level of rent determined by\nthe Tribunal is not therefore limited by the Order. Details of the maximum fair\nrent calculation are provided with this decision.\nDECISION\n28. The fair rent determined by the Tribunal for the purposes of Section 70 was\n£118.00 per week to include service charges of £6.53 per week from 4 November\n2021 which confirms the amount registered by the Rent Officer.\n29. In reaching its determination, the Tribunal had regard to the evidence and\nsubmissions of the parties, the relevant law and their own knowledge and\nexperience as an expert Tribunal but not any special or secret knowledge.\nPage 5 of 6\n\nAPPEAL\n30. If either party is dissatisfied with this decision, they may apply for permission to\nappeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) on any point of law arising\nfrom this Decision. Prior to making such an appeal, an application must be\nmade, in writing, to this Tribunal for permission to appeal. Any such application\nmust be made within 28 days of the issue of this decision (regulation 52 (2) of\nThe Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rule 2013)\nstating the grounds upon which it is intended to rely in the appeal.\nPage 6 of 6"

The form of remote hearing was V: CVPREMOTE. A face-to-face\nhearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be\ndetermined in a remote hearing. The documents before the tribunal at the\nhearing were;\n1. The applicant’s bundle of documents (84 pages)\n2. The expert report of Mr Broadhurst of Jackson Green & Preston (128\npages)\n3. A revised valuation calculation from Mr Broadhurst (2 pages)\nAt the hearing the tribunal heard submissions from Mr Yushchuk and\nevidence and submissions from Mr Broadhurst MRICS of Jackson Green &\nPreston, acting for the respondent. The applicant’s bundle contained an\nexpert’s report from Mr T Jackman MRICS of Aspects Surveyors Limited.\nSummary of the tribunal’s decision\n(1) The value of the existing lease is £351,915.\n(2) The value of the freehold with vacant possession is £420,000.\n(3) The premium payable for the new lease is £41,455.00.\nThe tribunal’s valuation is attached to this decision.\nThe application\n1. This is an application made by Mr Aliaksei Yushchuk pursuant to\nsection 48 (1) Leasehold Reform Housing and Urban Development Act\n1993 (“the 1993 Act”) for a determination of the premium to be paid\nfor a lease extension, or other terms of acquisition of the lease of the\nground floor flat 2 Fox Lane London N13 4AH (the “Property”).\n2. By a notice of claim dated 13 December 2019, served pursuant to\nSection 42 of the Act, Mr Yushchuk exercised his right to claim a new\nlease of the property and proposed to pay a premium of £25,000 for the\nnew lease.\n3. On 23 January 2020 the respondent landlord served a counter-notice\nadmitting the validity of the claim and counter-proposed a premium of\n£56,000.00 for the new lease.\n4. On 18 April 2020 the applicant applied to the tribunal for a\ndetermination of the premium.\n2\n\nThe issues\nMatters agreed\n5. The tribunal had before it a Statement of Agreed Facts dated 5 February\n2021 which agreed\n(i) Unexpired term at valuation date: 64.01 years\n(ii) Capitalisation rate: 6%\n(iii) Deferment rate: 5%\n6. Neither valuer denied that the lease of the Property dated 10 January\n1985 is for a term of 99 years from 25 December 1984 at a ground rent\nof £50, rising to £100 after 33 years, and £200 after a further 33 years.\nThe applicant’s bundle also contained an official copy of a Deed of\nVariation of the lease dated 6 November 1995 from which page 2, which\nset out the variations permitted by the Deed, was missing. Neither party\nwas able to provide the tribunal with a copy of the missing page, and\nneither were able to clarify how it had varied the lease.\n7. It was clear at the hearing that it was agreed that the Property is a one-\nbedroom flat and that it enjoyed exclusive use of a garden.\n8. Until the day before the hearing Mr Broadhurst, not having inspected\nthe interior of the Property was assuming that the flat had a floor area\nof 63 m2. On receipt of the applicant’s bundle he adjusted this to 72m2,\nbeing the floor area adopted by Mr Jackman in his valuation.\nMatters not agreed\n9. The existing lease value. The applicant contended that this was\n£345,625 and Mr Broadhurst for the respondent contended that it was\n£351,915.\n10. The value of the extended lease with vacant possession. Mr Jackman\ncontended that this should be £391,050 and Mr Broadhurst\n£435,000.\n11. Relativity. The applicant’s valuation gave a relativity of 87.5% while Mr\nBroadhurst argued for a relativity of 80.9%\n12. The premium. The applicant’s valuation placed this at £31,861. Mr\nBroadhurst amended his valuation at the hearing to argue for a\npremium of £49,700.\n3\n\n13. Neither the applicant’s notice nor the respondent’s counter-notice\nsought any amendment to the form of the lease other than the amount\nof the premium and the provisions required by statute. However there\nwas evidence in the applicant’s bundle that the landlord had proposed\ncertain amendments to the lease, some but not all of which the tenant\nhad indicated that he was prepared to accept.\nThe hearing\n14. The hearing took place on 26 May 2021. The applicant was\nunrepresented. The report of his valuer, Mr Jackman of Aspect\nSurveyors Limited was in the applicant’s bundle but he did not attend\nthe hearing. The respondent was represented by Mr Broadhurst MRICS\nof Jackson Green & Preston.\n15. Neither party asked the tribunal to inspect the property and the\ntribunal did not consider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection\nto make its determination.\n16. The applicant relied upon the valuation of Mr Jackman of 1 June\n2019and the respondent relied upon the expert report and valuation of\nMr Broadhurst dated.17 May 2021 and his revised valuation submitted\nto the Tribunal on 25 May 2021.\n17. The following case was referred to by Mr Broadhurst;\nDeritend Investments (Birkdale) Limited v Ms Kornelia Treskonova\n[2020] UKUT 0164 (LC) (“Deritend”)\nEvidence and submissions\n18. Mr Jackman’s report did not clarify the basis upon which he had\nreached his valuation other than to say that he had chosen, ‘the direct\ncomparison method of valuation appraisal’, that he had had discussions\nwith local estate agents and analysed market commentaries and date to\ndetermine his opinion of the value of the subject property. Mr\nYushchuk gave unsupported oral evidence that the property had been\nvalued in July 2017 at £347,000.\n19. Mr Yushchuk submitted that the floor area of the flat was not relevant\nto the valuation and argued that the layout of the flat was such that it\nwas difficult to measure. When questioned by the tribunal Mr\nYushchuk confirmed that since the lease was granted new double-\nglazed windows and a new bathroom had been installed. There was no\noff-street parking. The flat has gas central heating.\n20. Mr Broadhurst submitted that there is no direct comparable evidence\nfor the sale of a short leasehold interest similar to the property. He used\nthree comparables in Fox Lane to establish the freehold value of the\n4\n\nproperty, adjusting these for non physical and physical factors. He\nadjusted the date of sale of the comparable properties with reference to\nthe price index for flats and maisonettes in the London Borough of\nEnfield from January 2017 to January 2020. He then adjusted the\ncomparable prices to reflect distinguishing physical factors and\nweighted each comparable to arrive at a price per square metre to apply\nto the property to reach a FHVP value of £435,000.\n21. Mr Broadhurst’s referred the tribunal to three comparables, all of which\nhe adjusted for both non-physical and physical features. The non-\nphysical was the date of the sale of each comparable which he adjusted\nwith reference to the price index for flats and maisonettes in the\nLondon Borough of Enfield. If the property had a ground rent he\ncapitalised this at 6%.\n• 2a Fox Lane is a two-bedroom flat on the first floor of the\nbuilding of which the property forms part which, with a 125 year\nlease, sold on 23 February 2018 for £404,500, adjusted to\nvaluation date with rent capitalised the rent at 6% to give a value\nof £397,225.23. Mr Broadhurst and increased the price by 5%\n‘to reflect subject property end link’.\n• 6 Fox Lane sold on 18 October 2018 for £500,000 with a\nshare of the freehold, time adjusted to £494,871.78. Mr\nBroadhurst added £35,000 for the extension, £10,000 for the\ncellar, £5000 for a summerhouse and £15,000 for a private rear\ngarden. This gave a value of £429,881.78 which he again\nadjusted by 5% ‘to reflect subject property end link’.\n• 30a Fox Lane sold on 2 August 2017 for £436,000, with a\nshare of the freehold, time adjusted to date of valuation to\n£417,025.85. Mr Broadhurst increased this by £10,000 to reflect\nthat it enjoyed on-site car parking which is something that 2 Fox\nLane could not achieve. He uplifted the price by 5% to reflect\nthat the property is structurally detached.\n22. Mr Broadhurst took a price (from his adjusted figures) per square\nmetre based on their EPC certificates for each of the comparables and\nthen weighted these, attributing a weighting of 40% to each of 6 Fox\nlane and 30a Fox Lane and 20% to 2a Fox Lane to give a freehold\nvacant possession value to 2 Fox Lane of £435,000.\n23. Mr Yushchuk pointed out that 2a Fox Lane had to be a good\ncomparable as it is in the same building and that 30a Fox Lane was in a\ndifferent type of building. He stated that 6 Fox Lane was equivalent to 2\nFox Lane when it was sold in 2016 for £415,000, but that it had\nsubsequently been extended to create a second bedroom.\n24. Insofar as relativity is concerned Mr Broadhurst submitted that in the\nabsence of market evidence, as he submitted was the case here, it was\nappropriate to rely upon graphs of relativity, and that he considered the\n5\n\nmost appropriate graph to be that of Savills 2015 Enfranchiseable (sic)\nGraph of Relativity. He adopted the unenfranchiseable relativity of\n80.9% to give consideration to the Act rights. He cross-referred to the\nGerald Eve 2016 Enfranchisement Graph of Relativity which provides a\nrelativity of 81.026%. He did not consider that the fact that the flat is\nnot in prime Central London was a matter which necessitated an\nadjustment to the graphs he used.\n25. Mr Jackman’s valuation used a relativity of 87.5% without any\nexplanation.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n26. The tribunal has had regard to the valuation reports in the bundles, the\nevidence that it heard, and the case law referred to in reaching its\ndecision. As appropriate these are referred to in the reasons for the\ntribunal’s decision.\n27. It is unfortunate that Mr Jackman did not attend the hearing so that\nthe respondent did not have the opportunity of cross-examining him on\nhis report. The tribunal have accordingly not been able to place as\nmuch weight on his report as it might have been able to do if he had\nattended\n28. The tribunal does not consider that there is sufficient certainty as to the\nsquare meterage of any of the comparables to make this a useful basis\nof comparison. It has therefore looked at the physical configuration of\nthe properties.\n29. In weighting his comparables Mr Broadhurst only attributed 20% of the\ntotal price per square metre to 2a Fox Lane, attributing 40% to each of\nhis other comparables, 6 Fox Lane and 30a Fox Lane. The tribunal do\nnot consider this weighing to be appropriate. It considers that 2a and 6\nFox Lane offer the better comparables than 30a Fox Lane which is in a\ndifferent type of building.\n30. Following the decision in Mundy the preferred method of establishing\nrelativity is to look to market transactions around the valuation date as\nthe starting point for determining the value of the existing lease without\nrights under the 1993 Act.\n31. The comparables offered by Mr Broadhurst assist the tribunal in\nestablishing both the existing leasehold and the freehold vacant\npossession value of the property.\n32. 2a Fox Lane is a good comparable for existing lease value as it is in the\nsame building as the property. Its sale price adjusted to the valuation\ndate gives a value of £395,596. However it is owned on a 125 year lease,\n6\n\nand benefits from a second bedroom, which on the evidence before the\ntribunal clearly affects value, Mr Broadhurst attributed a value of\n£35,000 to the addition of a second bedroom to 6 Fox Lane. Taking this\ninto account, and the longer lease, the Tribunal accept Mr Broadhurst’s\nvaluation of the existing leasehold of the property at £351,915. It is not\nnecessary to ‘to reflect subject property end link’, as this comparable is\nin the same building as the property.\n33. For the freehold vacant possession value of the property the tribunal\nhas had regard to the comparables at 6 Fox Lane and 30a Fox Lane,\nboth of which own a share of the freehold. 6 Fox Lane is a good\ncomparable as it is a ground floor flat. Taking its time adjusted value of\n£494,872 the Tribunal has deducted £60,000 to allow for the extra\nbedroom, cellar, summerhouse and a larger private garden than the\nproperty has giving an adjusted value to its freehold interest of\n£434,872.\n34. 30 Fox is also useful comparable for the freehold vacant possession\nvalue. Taking its time adjusted value of £417,025 the Tribunal has had\nregard to the fact that it enjoys off street parking, which is not a facility\nthat will be available to the property. It considers it more appropriate to\ndeduct £15,000 (rather than the £10,000 proposed by Mr Broadhurst)\nto reflect this facility, giving an adjusted value of £402,025.\n35. The Tribunal took an average of the freehold vacant possession values\nof the evidence provided by these comparables and accordingly find\nthat the freehold vacant possession value for the property is £418,500\nand the extended lease value is £414,315.\n36. The figures adopted by the Tribunal give a relativity of 84.08%.\nFollowing Mundy the Tribunal has based its value of the existing lease\non the available market transactions around the valuation date. It\ncross-checked its value against the relativities proposed by the\nApplicant (87.5%) and the Respondent (80.9%) and note that the\nrelativity it has adopted sits comfortably between these two proposed\nrelativities.\nThe form of lease\n37. The Tribunal noted from the papers before it that the Respondent had\nproposed varying the lease to provide for the landlord to insure the\nstructure of the building with the tenant contributing a proportion of\nthe cost. The form of the lease was not a matter before the Tribunal to\ndecide, however it would encourage the parties to consider making\nthese amendments to the form of the lease. Section 57(6) contemplates\nthat the parties may between themselves agree variations to the terms\nof the new lease.\n7\n\nThe premium\n38. Taking the existing leasehold value, extended leasehold value and\nfreehold vacant possession value found by the tribunal for the property\nthe tribunal determine that the premium is £41,455, as set out in its\nvaluation in the Appendix.\nName: Judge Pittaway Date: 30 June 2021\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n8\n\nAPPENDIX\nValuation\nValuation of 2 Fox Lane, London N13 4 AH\nFreeholder's Present Interest\nTerm\nInitial ground rent £50\ninitial rent expired 0 £0\nIncreased ground rent £100\nYP 31.01 yrs @6% 13.3 £1,393.00\nIncreased ground rent £200\nYP 33 yrs @6% 14.23\nPV £1 in 31.01 years @6% 0.16415 2.3358545 £467\nTerm Total £1,860\nReversion\nFreehold VP £418,500\nPV £1 in 64.01 years 5.5% 0.04402 £18,422.37 £20,283\nPresent interest\nAfter extension 418,500\nPV of £1 154.01years at 5% 0.0005453 £228.21 £228\nDiminution £20,054.63 £20,283\nMarriage Value\nValue after lease extension\nproposed freeholders interest £228\nproposed leaseholders interest £414,315 £41,4543\nless\nexisting freeholder's interest £20,283\nexisting leaseholder's interest £351,915 £372,198\nMarriage Value £42,345\n£21,172\nlandlord share 50% £21,172.5\n9\n\n£41,455\nLease Extension Premium\n10"

The form of remote hearing was\nP:PAPERREMOTE, A face-to-face hearing was not held because no-one\nrequested the same, and all issues could be determined on paper. The\ndocuments that the Tribunal were referred to are in a bundle of 166 pages, the\ncontents of which have been noted.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nSummary of the tribunal’s decision\n(1) The appropriate premium payable for the new lease is £42,270.00.\nBackground\n1. This is an application made by the applicant leaseholder pursuant to\nsection 42 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development\nAct 1993 (“the Act”) for a determination of the premium to be paid for\nthe grant of a new lease of 45 Leopold Road, Willesden, London NW10\n9LG (the “property”).\n2. On 4 June 2020, District Judge Kumrai sitting remotely at the\nWillesden County Court made the following Order.\n3. Upon reading the Claim, Witness Statements of Praveen Younas dated\n21 January 2020 and William Maclean Brown dated 29 January 2020\nand correspondence from Hodders Law. And upon being satisfied that\nthe Claimant has the right to acquire a new lease under section 39 of\nthe Leasehold Reform Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (‘the\nAct’) and that the Defendant cannot be found following - reasonable\nenquiries IT IS ORDERED that: 1. The service of an initial notice under\nsection 42 of the Act shall be dispensed with. 2. The Claimant is entitled\nto a vesting order under section 50(1) of the Act providing for the\nsurrender of the lease of the flat, the address of which is First Floor\nFlat, 45 Leopold Road, Willesden NW10 9LG with title number NGL\n677752 (\"the flat\"), and for the granting to the Claimant of a new lease\nupon such terms as may be determined by the First Tier Tribunal\n(Property Chamber - Residential) (“the Tribunal”). 3. The matter be\ntransferred to the Tribunal for a determination of the premium and the\nterms of acquisition.\nThe issues\nMatters not in issue\n(a) The subject property is a self-contained flat on the first and\nsecond floor within a two/three storey Mid- terrace converted\nhouse, built approximately 120 years ago, which had\nsubsequently been converted into two flats. A ground floor flat,\nand the subject flat which is on the first floor. Access to the\nproperty is via a communal entrance. The flat comprised of on\nthe first floor a kitchen/breakfast room, bedroom and bathroom.\n(b) block of flats constructed in about [Date] and containing xx\nflats of similar kinds;\n(c) The valuation date: 12 February 2020;\n2\n\n(d) Unexpired term: 68.87 years;\n(e) Ground rent: The ground rent was £50.00, which was due to\nincrease to £100.00 on 25 December 2022 and finally to\n£150.00 on 25 December 2055;\n(f) Long leasehold (unimproved) value: 99% of the freehold\n(unimproved) value;\n(g) Capitalisation of ground rent: 6% per annum; and\n(h) Deferment rate: 5%.\nThe hearing\n4. The paper determination took place on 29.07.2021. The applicant was\nrepresented by William Maclean Brown, the respondent was not a party\nto the proceedings as the matter was dealt with pursuant to Section\n50(1) of the Leasehold Reform Housing and Urban Development Act\n1993.\n5. The Tribunal did not inspect the property as the tribunal did not\nconsider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection to make its\ndetermination.\n6. The applicant relied upon the expert report and valuation of Andrew M\nLester MRICS dated 22 January 2021.\n7. In his report Mr Andrew Lester stated at paragraph 8.2 & 8.4 “I\nmeasured this flat with an electronic measuring device and estimate\nthat it has a current gross internal floor area (GIA) of 83 square metres\n(890 square feet). The enfranchisement legislation requires that\nleaseholders’ authorized improvements which add value are to be\nignored and the properties are to be valued on an “unimproved” basis.\nIn this case the leaseholder has converted the original roof space into\ntwo extra bedrooms. The roof space does not belong to the leaseholder\nand therefore technically the creation of these two additional bedrooms\nis unlawful. At Appendix D is a draft witness statement produced by\nFahim Khan (the company secretary of the claimant leaseholder) and\nalso a copy of an entry from the London Borough of Brent’s website\nwhich shows that an application for building regulation approval was\nmade in 2010. Both documents show that this work of alteration was\ncarried out in 2009/10.”\n8. Mr Lester assessed the value of the property on the basis of the roof\nspace being unimproved and on the basis of the improvement subject\nto the tenant’s rights of accretion. With two valuations, the original\ndemised flat had a gross internal floor are of 57 square metres, or (615\nsquare metres). In his report Mr Lester set out the factors which were\nat play in the market which he assessed as reasonably buoyant on and\naround the valuation date.\n3\n\nThe Freehold Vacant Possession Value\n9. In the appendix to his report Mr Lester set out the comparables which\nhad been considered by him in determining the freehold vacant\npossession value. He took the sales of 62A St Mary’s Road and 11A\nHawkshead Road as the best evidence as their condition, which he\nstated reflected the requirement that the valuations are to reflect an\nunimproved basis. He also noted that both flats were marketed as\nhaving roof space potential, which reflects the requirement of\nvaluation 2.\n10. He considered that a rate of £550 per square foot was appropriate for\nthe FHVP of the first floor flat only with roof space potential and as a\nresult consider that the FHVP for LE valuation 2 ( without the\nunauthorised extension, in unimproved condition) was £338,250. He\nstated that he had been unable to find any sales of flats at first/second\nfloor level in order to establish direct evidence. However, he\nconsidered that a discount should apply to the second floor and\naccordingly applied a rate of 75% to the £550 per square foot, making\n£412.50 the rate for the second floor. This produces a FHVP of\n£451,687.50, which was rounded to £450,000.\nThe marriage Value\n11. As the property has less than 80 years remaining, the legislation states\nthat then marriage value should be included in the calculation.\nMarriage value effectively is the amount of value that is unlocked by the\ngranting of the lease extension, with both the leaseholder and\nfreeholder leaseholder sharing the marriage value equally. Relativity is\nthe percentage of the current lease value divided by the freehold\nunimproved vacant possession.\n12. Mr Lester stated that -: “… at Appendix G is a table produced by a well-\nknown enfranchisement lawyer Piers Harrison and presented at a\nValuers’ Conference held on 6 November 2019, which illustrates\nvarious deductions made by the Upper Tribunal in cases. Various\ndifferent lease terms mentioned of 67.49/68.62/68.67/66.81 years are\nsimilar to the lease term remaining of 68.86 years and in all cases the\ndeduction is 3.50%. This produces a without Act rights relativity of\n83.99%. By taking this percentage and the other two detailed under\n19.14 of 83.79% and 84.21% produces an average of precisely 84% and I\nconsider this percentage of 84% to be the correct relativity to be applied\nin this valuation.\n13. At paragraph 20.1 to 20.06 Mr Lester set out the two basis of the\nvaluation he stated as follows-:\n4\n\n“VALUATIONS 20.1 LE valuation 1 20.2 My opinion as to the price\nwhich I consider reasonable to be paid to statutorily extend the current\nleasehold interest in the subject property and assuming that the\nproperty includes the second floor as currently presented, as at 12\nFebruary 2020, is £42,270 (forty- two thousand, two hundred and\nseventy pounds). 20.3 The calculation showing how this price been\nreached, considering all the factors described in this report, is at\nAppendix J. 20.4 LE valuation 2 20.5 My opinion as to the price which\nI consider reasonable to be paid to statutorily extend the current\nleasehold interest in the subject property and assuming that the\nproperty includes the roof space (which has not been developed), as at\n12 February 2020, is £31,970 (thirty- one thousand, nine hundred and\nseventy pounds).\nThe tribunal’s determination and Reasons for the tribunal’s\ndetermination\n14. The tribunal determines that we have considered the report prepared\nfor the Tribunal by Mr Lester, we have used our own independent\njudgment and consider that his report is balanced and fair. We\naccepted his conclusions concerning the valuation of the premises.\nThe premium\n(2) The tribunal determines the appropriate premium to be £42,270.00.\n15.

The Applicant had made an application under section 27A of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) contesting the\nmanagement charge imposed by the Respondent. A decision was\npublished on 2 September 2025. That decision concluded that the\ncontested service charges (ie the management fee) were reasonably\nincurred. The decision made provision for the parties to provide written\nsubmissions as to whether orders should be made under section 20C of\nthe 1985 Act and paragraph 5A of schedule 11 to the Commonhold and\nLeasehold Reform Act 2002. The parties were invited to make\nsubmissions on whether the lease made provision for the relevant\ncharges (with particular emphasis on an administration charge), and\nwhether it would be just an equitable to make the orders.\nDecisions of the Tribunal\n2. Written submissions were received from both parties. I do not consider\nit necessary to summarise them here otherwise than appears hereunder.\nThe administration charge\n3. The key clause in relation to the administration charge is that at\nparagraph 12 of the third schedule, by which the lessee (“the Buyer”)\ncovenants\n“To pay all expenses (including Solicitor's costs and surveyor's\nfees) incurred by the Company or the Management Company\n… incidental to the preparation and service of any notice under\nSection 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (or any statutory\nmodification re-enactment or replacement thereof)\nnotwithstanding that forfeiture is avoided (otherwise than by\nrelief granted by the Court)”\n4. This clause is one of a familiar family of similar clauses, which vary\naccording to their specific wording, but which, depending on their\nwording, may allow a lessor pass on legal costs incurred in proceedings\nbefore the Tribunal to the lessor as an administration charge. Whether\ndifferent formulations of this family of clauses do so, and in what\ncircumstances, is discussed extensively in Tower Hamlets v Khan [2022]\nEWCA Civ 831, [2022] L. & T.R. 30.\n5. In that case, Newey LJ, in reviewing previous cases, considered a number\nof different formulations of similar clauses and emphasised that\n“[r]egard must be had to the specific language which the parties have\nchosen to include in the particular lease”. Some clauses refer to\n“proceedings” in relation to, or “the purposes of”, a section 146 notice,\nand some include the “contemplation” of service of a notice, or\nproceedings, as well as costs “incidental” to preparation and service etc\n2\n\n6. The clause in this lease is at the narrowest end of the spectrum of section\n146 clauses. The relevant costs must be “incidental to the preparation\nand service of” a section 146 notice. In Khan, the court said this about\nthese words:\n“the words ‘incidental to’ tend to suggest something\nsubordinate. One of the meanings given to ‘incidental’ in the\nOxford English Dictionary is ‘[s]uch as is incurred (in the\nexecution of some plan or purpose) apart from the primary\ndisbursements’. In the same vein, Arden LJ observed in\nContractreal [Contractreal Ltd v Davies [2001] EWCA Civ\n928] that ‘the natural meaning of the word “incidental” is to\ndenote a lesser or subordinate sum’ and that, in the context of\ncosts, the expression ‘of and incidental to’ ‘has received a\nlimited meaning’”.”\n7. The actual clause in Khan itself was broader than that in this lease. But\nin considering these elements of that clause, the Court said:\n“In the present case … no section 146 notice has been served,\nand it is, I think, very much open to question whether costs of\nproceedings can be deemed ‘incidental’ to ‘the preparation and\nservice of’ a section 146 notice when no such ‘preparation’ or\n‘service’ has ever taken place. While costs can be incurred ‘in\ncontemplation of’ the service of a section 146 notice without\nany such notice being prepared or served in the event, the\nextent to which costs can be considered ‘incidental’ to ‘the\npreparation and service’ of a notice which is never undertaken\nstrikes me as much more doubtful.”\n8. Further, in this case, the application was made by the lessee, not the\nlandlord or management company. The legal costs of defending this\napplication are far too remote from the preparation of a section 146\nnotice to be incidental to it, and therefore for it to be possible for them\nto be recovered under this clause.\n9. In her written submissions, Ms Hughes also refers to paragraph 14 of the\nsame schedule. The lessee thereby covenants\n“To indemnify and keep indemnified the Company against all\ndamages costs and any other liabilities resulting from any non-\nobservance or non-performance by the Buyer or his\nundertenant of any covenants relating to the Property herein\ncontained or on the registers of the title above referred to”\n10. I do not understand Ms Hughes’ developed submissions to rely on this\nclause. Nonetheless, I do not consider that this clause assists the\nRespondent for two reasons.\n11. First, an indemnity clause such as this is aimed at protecting a landlord\nagainst costs to – at least paradigmatically – third parties caused by\n3\n\nbreaches of the lease. The term “damages costs and any other liabilities”\nis apt to describe a liability directly imposed on the Company as a result\nof a default of the lessee. A decision by the Company to engage solicitors\nand counsel to defend an action no doubt imposes a liability on the\nCompany to pay its legal bills, but that is not the sort of normal\ndiscretionary contractual liability that, on a natural meaning, an\nindemnity clause is designed to cover.\n12. Secondly, as the Applicant observes in his written submissions, it is only\nliabilities imposed on the Company that are covered by this clause, not\nthe Management Company. The Company was defined as a party to the\nlease as Academy Central LLP, the successor in title of which is now\nAviva, not L and Q, the Management Company.\n13. Decision: there is no provision in the lease for an administration charge\ncovering the legal costs of the proceedings to be passed on to the\nApplicant. As a result of so deciding, I make no order under paragraph\n5A, schedule 11 to the 2002 Act.\nThe service charge\n14. Part II of the sixth schedule sets out the expenditure that may be\nrecovered in the service charge (“Management Charge”). It includes, at\nparagraph 9\n“The costs incurred by the Management Company in bringing\nor defending any actions or other proceedings against or by any\nperson whatsoever”\n15. In his written submissions, Mr Smith makes arguments as to the\nproportionality and reasonableness of the Respondent’s legal costs, and\nmakes some criticisms of its conduct of the litigation. Neither are\nrelevant to the first issue, which is whether the lease provides for the\nlegal costs to be recovered through the service charge.\n16. Paragraph 9 is a very broadly drafted clause that clearly allows the legal\ncosts of these proceedings to be recovered through the service charge.\n17. Turning to whether an order under section 20C should be made, Mr\nSmith’s points about proportionality and reasonableness are not\nrelevant. In determining both whether the costs are recoverable as a\nservice charge, and whether an order limiting those costs should be\nmade, the Tribunal does not and cannot take account of the\nreasonableness in amount of any charges. That question remains open,\nand may be challenged on an application under section 27A when the\nrelevant service charge is demanded.\n18. An application under section 20C is to be determined on the basis of\nwhat is just and equitable in all the circumstances (Tenants of Langford\nCourt v Doren Ltd (LRX/37/2000).\n4\n\n19. Such an order is an interference with the landlord’s contractual rights,\nand must never be made as a matter of course. The Tribunal should take\ninto account the effect of the order on others affected, including the\nlandlord: Re SCMLLA (Freehold) Ltd [2014] UKUT 58 (LC); Conway v\nJam Factory Freehold Ltd [2013] UKUT 592 (LC); [2014] 1 EGLR 111.\nIn this case, the Management Company is a large social housing\norganisation, with substantial income across a large portfolio. It is not at\nall comparable to the sort of leaseholder owned freehold company with\nlimited access to resources referred to in Conway.\n20. The success or failure of a party to the proceedings is not determinative.\nComparative success is, however, a significant matter in weighing up\nwhat is just and equitable in the circumstances.\n21. Mr Smith argues that there were failings in the way the litigation was\nconducted that should be taken into account. He refers to a refusal by the\nRespondent to provide him with material relating to a flat in a non-RTM\nbuilding. I do not think there was any obligation on the Respondent to\ndo so, and do not think it should be taken into account. He also objects\nthat reference to the RICS guidance was only raised at a late stage. He\ndid not take an objection to the point (as a matter of timing) at the\nhearing. This is relevant to my conclusion that he was not prejudiced by\nthe fact that counsel made an argument not previously made. It was not\na case of late evidence, and I consider that he was perfectly capable of\nmaking his counter-arguments.\n22. In this case, the Respondent has been wholly successful, and, in the light\nof the considerations discussed above, I do not think it would be fair and\nequitable to prevent them from relying on their contractual right to pass\nthe costs on in the service charge.\n23. Mr Smith asks, in effect, that I order that any such service charge be\nlevied across the whole of the Respondent’s portfolio. I have no power to\nmake such an order, and the Respondent has not contractual right to do\nso.\n24. Decision: the Tribunal makes no order under section 20C of the 1985\nAct.\nRights of appeal\n25. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the London regional office.\n26. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the office within\n28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\n5\n\n27. If the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, the\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at these reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\nfor permission to appeal to proceed despite not being within the time\nlimit.\n28. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, give the date, the property and the case\nnumber; state the grounds of appeal; and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\nName: Judge R Percival Date: 17 October 2025\n6"

The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR24"

The following costs are payable by the respondent to the\napplicant, pursuant to section 88 of the Commonhold and\nLeasehold Reform Act 2002 (‘the 2002 Act’):\n• Section 88(1) costs - £2,566.95\n• Section 88(3) costs - £1,645.80\nB. The respondent shall pay the sum of £110 (One Hundred and\nTen Pounds) to the applicant, in reimbursement of the\nTribunal application fee, by 5:00pm on 02 April 2025.\nThe background and application\n1. The application concerns a RTM claim under Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the\nCommonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (‘the 2002 Act’). It\nrelates to the Property, which is a purpose-built block containing 50\nflats all let on long leases. The respondent is a RTM company and the\nmembers are leaseholders of some of the flats. The applicant is the\nfreeholder of the Property.\n2. The respondent originally gave a claim notice to the applicant, pursuant\nto section 79 of the 2002 Act, on 02 January 2024 (‘the First Claim’).\nThe applicant served a negative counter-notice on 06 February 2024,\nalleging the applicant had not established compliance with sections\n78(1) and (3), 79(2) and (3) and 80(8) and (9).\n3. The respondent then submitted a Tribunal application for a\ndetermination it was entitled to acquire RTM under section 84(3) of the\n2002 Act (‘the First Application’).\n4. The First Application was dismissed by an order of Deputy Regional\nJudge Carr dated 06 June 2024.\n5. On 03 July 2024 the respondent gave a further claim notice to the\nrespondent (‘the Second Claim’). The applicant served a negative\ncounter-notice on 07 August 2024, alleging the applicant had not\nestablished compliance with sections 78(1), (2), (3) and (5) and 79(2)\nand (3) of the 2002 Act.\n6. The respondent then submitted a further section 84(3) application (‘the\nSecond Application’), which is the subject of a separate decision of\ntoday’s date under case reference LON/00BG/LRM/2024/0605.\n7. This case concerns the costs of the First Claim and the First\nApplication. The applicant seeks a determination of these costs\n2\n\npursuant to section 88(4) of the 2002 Act. Directions were issued on 14\nNovember 2024, and the case was allocated to the paper track. Neither\nparty has objected to this allocation of requested a hearing. The paper\ndetermination took place on 19 March 2025.\n8. The relevant legal provisions are set out in the appendix to this\ndecision.\nThe parties’ submissions\n9. The Tribunal was supplied with a 341-page digital bundle in accordance\nwith the directions. This included copies of the application and\ndirections, the claim notice and counter-notice, the parties’ statements\nof case and relevant correspondence and documents.\n10. Details of the applicant’s costs are set out in its statement of case and\nsupporting bundle dated 30 January 2025. The bundle includes\nstatements of costs and copy invoices together with copies of various\ncosts decisions from the First-tier and Upper Tribunals. The total sum\nclaimed is £4,818.51, which is broken down as follows:\n• Legal costs and disbursements relating to the claim notice -\n£2,722.71 (including VAT)\n• Management fee relating to the claim notice - £450 (including\nVAT)\n• Legal costs for the First Application - £1,645.80 (including VAT)\n11. The statements of costs show the legal work was undertaken by Ms\nLorraine Scott (grade A fee earner) at £325 per hour and Mr Matthew\nHarkes (grade D) at £195 per hour.\n12. The respondent relies on a statement of case dated 01 February 2025.\nThey dispute various elements of the costs claim and propose an\nalternative figure of £396 (including VAT). Their arguments can be\nsummarised as follows:\n(a) The disbursements relating to service of the counter-notice\n(courier’s fee of £119.76 and Royal Mail special delivery charge of\n£7.35) should be disallowed in full, as a letter from the applicant’s\nrepresentative, accompanying the claim notice, explained their\noffices are not manned and their email address should be used for\ndelivery of the counter-notice.\n(b) The time spent perusing the claim notice is excessive and all this\nwork should have been undertaken by Mr Harkes at £195 per\nhour.\n(c) The time spent for perusing supporting documents is excessive\nand all this work should have been undertaken at £195 per hour.\n3\n\n(d) The time spent preparing the counter-notice is excessive, as it\nwould be based on a template. Again, this should have been\nundertaken at £195 per hour\n(e) Mr Harkes’ time spent on letters out/emails to others (0.8 hours)\nshould be disallowed, given the other time claimed for\ncorrespondence. The statement of case suggests this work was\nundertaken on 07 August 2029, which is clearly an error.\n13. The applicant replied to these arguments in a further statement of case\ndated 20 February 2025. In brief it contends:\n(a) The service disbursements are recoverable as regulations provide\nfor a postal address of the counter-notice and it is unaware of any\nauthority for service by email. A courier was used as the counter-\nnotice could not be served by special delivery.\n(b) The grade A fee earner’s time was limited and the use of two fee\nearners is reasonable.\n(c) The disputed time is all reasonable.\nDiscussion and findings\n14. The costs relating to the claim notice are payable under section 88(1) of\nthe 2002 Act. They are to be assessed on a summary basis, and I have\nadopted a broadbrush approach.\n15. The respondent has not challenged the fee earner’s hourly rates\n(£325/195 per hour), which are allowed in full.\n16. The respondent has not challenged the Land Registry fees of £6, which\nare allowed.\n17. It was reasonable to attempt service of the counter-notice by special\ndelivery, given the importance of this document and consequences if\nnot served in time. The Royal Mail charge of £7.35 is allowed in full.\n18. It was also reasonable to serve the counter-notice by courier, once the\nspecial delivery had failed. However, based on my experience as a\nTribunal Judge and a solicitor in private practice, the courier’s charge is\non the high side. I allow £60, representing £50 plus VAT.\n19. It was reasonable to use two fee earners on the basis most work was\nundertaken by the grade D fee earner under the grade A’s supervision.\nThe total time claimed is 3.4 hours (grade A) and 5.4 hours (grade D).\nThe grade A time is on the high side, and I reduce this to 2 hours. The\ngrade D time is allowed in full.\n4\n\n20. The respondent has not challenged the management fee of £450, which\nis allowed in full.\n21. The section 88(1) costs payable by the respondent total £2,566.95,\nbroken down as follows:\n• Legal costs - £2,043.60 (£1,703 plus VAT)\n• Royal Mail - £7.35\n• Land Registry fees - £6\n• Courier’s charges - £60 (£50 plus VAT)\n• Management fee - £450 (£375 plus VAT)\n22. The costs relating to the First Application are payable under section\n88(3) as that application was dismissed by the Tribunal on 06 June\n2024. These costs have not been challenged by the respondent, and I\nallow the sum claimed (£1,645.80) in full.\n23. The total costs payable by the respondent are £4,212.75 (£2,566.95 plus\n£1,645.80), which is approximately 87% of the sum claimed\n(£4,818.75). Given this outcome, I order reimbursement of the\nTribunal application fee, pursuant to rule 13(2) of the Tribunal\nProcedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules. The\nrespondent must reimburse the £110 fee within 14 days of the date of\nthis decision.\nName: Tribunal Judge Donegan Date: 19 March 2025\n5\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the Tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the Tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n6\n\nCommonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002\nSection 79 Notice of claim to acquire right\n(1) A claim to acquire the right to manage any premises is made by\ngiving notice of the claim (referred to in this Chapter as a “claim\nnotice”); and in this Chapter the “relevant date”, in relation to any\nclaim to acquire the right to manage, means the date on which the\nnotice is given.\n(2) The claim notice may not be given unless each person required to\nbe given a notice of invitation to participate has been given such a\nnotice at least 14 days before.\n(3) The claim notice must be given by a RTM company which complies\nwith subsection (4) or (5).\n(4) If on the relevant date there are only two qualifying tenants of flats\ncontained in the premises, both must be members of the RTM\ncompany.\n(5) In any other case, the membership of the RTM company must on\nthe relevant date include a number of qualifying tenants of flats\ncontained in the premises which is not less than one-half of the total\nnumber of flats so contained.\n(6) The claim notice must be given to each person who on the relevant\ndate is –\n(a) landlord under a lease of the whole or any part of the premises,\n(b) party to such a lease otherwise than as landlord or tenant, or\n(c) a manager appointed under Part 2 of the Landlord and Tenant\nAct 1987 (referred to in this Part as “the 1987 Act”) to act in\nrelation to the premises or any premises containing or contained\nin the premises.\n(7) Subsection (6) does not require the claim notice to be given to a\nperson who cannot be found or whose identity cannot be\nascertained; but if this subsection means that the claim notice is not\nrequired to be given to anyone at all, section 85 applies.\n(8) A copy of the claim notice must be given to each person who on the\nrelevant date is the qualifying tenant of a flat contained in the\npremises.\n(9) Where a manager has been appointed under Part 2 of the 1987 Act\nto act in relation to the premises, or any premises containing or\ncontained in the premises, a copy of the claim notice must also be\ngiven to the tribunal or court by which he was appointed.\nSection 84 Counter-notices\n(1) A person who is given a claim notice by a RTM company under\nsection 79(6) may give a notice (referred to in this chapter as a\n“counter-notice”) to the company no later than the date specified in\nthe claim notice under section 80(6).\n7\n\n(2) A counter-notice is a notice containing a statement either –\n(a) admitting that the RTM company was on the relevant date\nentitled to acquire the right to manage the premises specified in\nthe claim notice, or\n(b) alleging that, by reason of specified provisions of this Chapter,\nthe RTM company was on that date not so entitled,\nand containing such other particulars (if any) as may be required to\ncontained in counter-notices, and complying with such\nrequirements (if any) about the form of counter-notices, as may be\nprescribed by regulations made by the appropriate national\nauthority.\n(3) Where the RTM company has been given one or more counter-\nnotices containing a statement such as is mentioned in subsection\n(2)(b), the company may apply to the appropriate tribunal for a\ndetermination that it was on the relevant date entitled to acquire the\nright to manage the premises.\n(4) An application under subsection (3) must be made not later than\nthe end of the period of two months beginning with the day on\nwhich the counter-notice (or, where more than one, the last of the\ncounter-notices) was given.\n(5) Where the RTM company has been given one or more counter-\nnotices containing a statement such as is mentioned in subsection\n(2)(b), the RTM company does not acquire the right to manage the\npremises unless –\n(a) on an application under subsection (3) it is finally determined\nthat the company was on the relevant date entitled to acquire the\nright to manage the premises, or\n(b) the person by whom the counter-notice was given agrees, or the\npersons by whom the counter-notices were given agree, in\nwriting that the company was so entitled.\n(6) If on an application under subsection (3) it is finally determined\nthat the company was not on the relevant date entitled to acquire\nthe right to manage the premises, the claim notice ceases to have\neffect.\n(7) A determination on an application under subsection (3) becomes\nfinal –\n(a) if not appealed against, at the end of the period for bringing an\nappeal, or\n(b) if appealed against, at the time when the appeal (or any further\nappeal) is disposed of.\n(8) An appeal is disposed of –\n(a) if it is determined and the period for bringing any further appeal\nhas ended, or\n(b) if it is abandoned or otherwise ceases to have effect.\n8\n\nSection 88 Costs: general\n(1) A RTM company is liable for reasonable costs incurred by a person\nwho is –\n(a) landlord under a lease of the whole or any part of any premises,\n(b) party to such a lease otherwise than as a landlord or tenant, or\n(c) a manager appointed under Part 2 of the Landlord and Tenant\nAct 1987 to act in relation to the premises, or any premises\ncontaining or contained in the premises,\nin consequence of a claim notice given by the company in relation to\nthe premises.\n(2) Any costs incurred by such a person in respect of professional\nservices rendered to him by another are to be regarded as\nreasonable only if and to the extent that costs in respect of such\nservices might reasonably be expected to have been incurred by him\nif the circumstances had been such that he was personally liable for\nall such costs.\n(3) A RTM company is liable for any costs which such a person incurs\nas a party to any proceedings under this Chapter before the\nappropriate tribunal only if the tribunal dismisses an application by\nthe company for a determination that it is entitled to acquire the\nright to manage the premises.\n(4) Any question arising in relation to any amount of any costs payable\nby a RTM company shall, in default of agreement, be determined by\nthe appropriate tribunal.\n9"

On 26th February 2024 the Tribunal determined a market rent of £950 per\nmonth to take effect from 3rd February 2024.\nBackground\n2. The case concerned the determination of a market rent for the subject property\nfollowing a referral of the Landlord’s notice of increase of rent by the Tenant\npursuant to sections 13 and 14 Housing Act 1988.\n3. On 18th December 2023 the Landlord’s Agent served a notice under Section\n13(2) of the Housing Act 1988 which proposed a new rent of £1,000 per month\nin place of the existing rent of £800 per month to take effect from 3rd February\n2024. The notice complied with the legal requirements.\n4. On 21st December 2023 the Tenant applied to the Tribunal under Section 13(4)\n(a) of the Housing Act 1988.\n5. The Tribunal does not routinely consider it necessary and proportionate in cases\nof this nature to undertake inspections or hold Tribunal hearings unless either\nare specifically requested by either party or a particular point arises which\nmerits such an inspection and/or hearing.\n6. The Tribunal issued directions on 9th January 2024 informing the parties that,\nunless either party objected, the Tribunal intended to determine the rent based\non written representations. The parties were invited to make submissions which\ncould include photographs or videos.\n7. Both parties submitted papers by the specified dates setting out their respective\ncases. The papers were also copied to the other party.\n8. Neither party objected to the matter being determined without an oral hearing,\nso the Tribunal determined the case on 26th February 2024 based on the written\nrepresentations received.\n9. These reasons address in summary form the key issues raised by the parties.\nThey do not recite each and every point referred to either in submissions or\nduring any hearing. However, this does not imply that any points raised, or\ndocuments not specifically mentioned were disregarded. If a point or document\nwas referred to in the evidence or submissions that was relevant to a specific\nissue, then it was considered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal concentrates on\nthose issues which, in its opinion, are fundamental to the application.\nThe Law\nS14 Determination of Rent by First-tier Tribunal\n(1) Where, under subsection (4) (a) of section 13 above, a tenant refers to a First-tier\nTribunal a notice under subsection (2) of that section, the Tribunal shall\ndetermine the rent at which, subject to subsections (2) and (4) below, the\nTribunal consider that the dwelling-house concerned might reasonably be\n2\n\nCHI/29UN/MNR/2024/0005\nexpected to be let in the open market by a willing landlord under an assured\ntenancy-\n(a) which is a periodic tenancy having the same periods as those of the tenancy\nto which the notice relates;\n(b) which begins at the beginning of the new period specified in the notice;\n(c) the terms of which (other than relating to the amount of the rent) are the\nsame as those of the tenancy to which the notice relates; and\n(d) in respect of which the same notices, if any, have been given under any of\nGrounds 1 to 5 of Schedule 2 to this Act, as have been given (or have effect\nas if given) in relation to the tenancy to which the notice relates.\n(2) In making a determination under this section, there shall be disregarded-\n(a) any effect on the rent attributable to the granting of a tenancy to a sitting\ntenant;\n(b) any increase in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a relevant\nimprovement carried out by a person who at the time it was carried out was\nthe tenant, if the improvement-\n(i) was carried out otherwise than in pursuance of an obligation to his\nimmediate landlord, or\n(ii) was carried out pursuant to an obligation to his immediate landlord\nbeing an obligation which did not relate to the specific improvement\nconcerned but arose by reference to consent given to the carrying out\nof that improvement; and\n(c) any reduction in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a failure by\nthe tenant to comply with any terms of the tenancy.\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) above, in relation to a notice which is\nreferred by a tenant as mentioned in subsection (1) above, an improvement is a\nrelevant improvement if either it was carried out during the tenancy to which the\nnotice relates, or the following conditions are satisfied, namely-\n(a) that it was carried out not more than twenty-one years before the date of\nservice of the notice; and\n(b) that, at all times during the period beginning when the improvement was\ncarried out and ending on the date of service of the notice, the dwelling-\nhouse has been let under an assured tenancy; and\n(c) that, on the coming to an end of an assured tenancy at any time during that\nperiod, the tenant (or, in the case of joint tenants, at least one of them) did\nnot quit.\n(4) In this section \"rent\" does not include any service charge, within the meaning of\nsection 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, but, subject to that, includes\nany sums payable by the tenant to the landlord on account of the use of\nfurniture, in respect of council tax or for any of the matters referred to in\nsubsection (1) (a) of that section, whether or not those sums are separate from\nthe sums payable for the occupation.\n3\n\nCHI/29UN/MNR/2024/0005\nThe Property\n10. From the information given in the papers and available on the internet, the\nproperty comprises a ground floor flat within a 4-storey block of similar\nproperties built about 18 years ago. The block is situated close to the seafront\nand within reach of all main amenities.\n11. The accommodation includes a Living Room, Kitchen, 2 Bedrooms and 2\nBathrooms (one en-suite). There is a single allocated car space.\n12. The property has gas-fired central heating and double-glazed windows. The EPC\nrating is ‘C’.\nSubmissions\n13. The initial tenancy began on 3rd January 2020 at a rent of £700 per month.\nCurtains are not provided by the Landlord.\n14. The Agent states that they have recently let number 32 in the same block for\n£1,000 a month and another agent has recently let a 2-bedroom flat for £950\nper month. The Agent acknowledges that the Tenant has reported that the boiler\nis making loud noises but states that it will not be looked at until March 2024.\n15. The Agent includes recent photographs which show the property to be in\nreasonable order.\n16. The Tenant states that the Living Room and Kitchen are open plan, that the\nboiler noise and water temperature are irregular and includes photographs of\nbroken thermostatic valves rendering the affected radiators as uncontrollable.\nConsideration and Valuation\n17. The Tribunal first considered whether it felt able to reasonably and fairly decide\nthis case based on the papers submitted only with no oral hearing. Having read\nand considered the papers it decided that it could do so.\n18. The Tribunal is required to determine the rent at which the subject property\nmight reasonably be expected to be let in the open market by a willing Landlord\nunder an assured tenancy. The personal circumstances of the Parties are not\nrelevant to this issue.\n19. Having carefully considered the representations from the parties and associated\ncorrespondence, and using its own judgement and knowledge of rental values in\nMargate, the Tribunal decided that the market rent for the subject property if let\ntoday in a condition that was usual for such an open market letting would be\n£1,000 per month.\n20. However, the Tribunal takes into account the Tenant’s provision of curtains and\nthe condition of the boiler and radiators, deciding that adjustments of £20 per\nmonth and £30 per month respectively should be made to reflect these\nshortcomings.\n4\n\nCHI/29UN/MNR/2024/0005\n21. The Tenant made no representation that the starting date for the new rent\nspecified in the Landlord’s notice would cause the Tenant undue hardship.\nDetermination\n22. The Tribunal therefore decided that the rent at which the subject property might\nreasonably be expected to be let in the open market by a willing Landlord under\nthe terms of this assured tenancy was £950 per month.\n23. The Tribunal directed that the new rent of £950 per month should\ntake effect for 12 months from 3rd February 2024, this being the date\nspecified in the notice.\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber)\nmust seek permission to do so by making written application to the First-tier\nTribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing with the case. Where\npossible you should send your application for permission to appeal by email to\nrpsouthern@justice.gov.uk as this will enable the First-tier Tribunal Regional\noffice to deal with it more efficiently.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the Tribunal\nsends to the person making the application written reasons for the decision.\n3. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time limit, the\nperson shall include with the application for permission to appeal a request for\nan extension of time and the reason for not complying with the 28-day time\nlimit; the Tribunal will then decide whether to extend time or not to allow the\napplication for permission to appeal to proceed.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the\nparty making the application is seeking.\n5"

An application involving the same parties came before the tribunal on 18\nNovember 2024, leading to a decision finding that the grounds for appointing\na manager had been made out but rejecting the proposed manager for the\nreasons set out therein. By a further a preliminary Notice under s22 The\nlandlord and Tenant Act 1987 (the Act) dated 6 January 2025 the Applicant\ngave notice of his intention to seek the appointment of a manager to manage\nthe Property for the reasons set out in the said Notice.\n\n2. This Notice was followed by an application to the tribunal under the provisions\nof s24 of the Act dated 12 February 2025.\n3. Directions were issued by the tribunal on 27 February 2025 listing the matter\nfor inspection and hearing on 3 July 2025, when the matter came before us.\n4. Before the hearing we were supplied with a bundle of papers running to some\n298 pages. It included the Notice, application and directions, the response from\nthe Respondent to the Notice together with details of the proposed manager,\nMr Lee Gardner of Uniq Block Management Ltd. The Respondent submitted\ndetails of his case with supporting papers and the Applicant responded to this.\nInspection\n5. The building is a four storey, plus basement, property fronting Cold Harbour\nLane. It comprises of commercial units at street level, two floors of residential\naccommodation above (the subject of this application) and top floor used it\nwould seem for communications technology. It appears to be in a tired\ncondition. Access to the upper floor is via a glass surrounded stair way. The\nentrance needs attention. There are unused and damaged post boxes on the\nfront exposed to the street. Access is by key. The stairs are concrete and the\nopening windows for these common parts are in poor condition.\n6. To the rear there is a service road leading to what would appear to be a garage\nat basement level. There are some car parking spaces for the flats but there were\nnot clearly delineated. We noted the concrete external stairs forming the fire\nescape to the fats, which was it seems, the subject of some fire damage. A\nlockable gate governed egress. The escape route was, at the time of our\ninspection, blocked with cardboard boxes, presumably from the commercial\nunits. There was a fenced area for refuse disposal at the side of the Property.\n7. Internally the landings serving the flats were in need of some care and attention.\nThe carpeting was poor, the decoration was, as with the exterior of the building\ntired. The electrical wiring to the lights was poorly completed with wires\nshowing. It is not clear whether the doors to the flats or the internal doors to\nthe landings were fire safety compliant.\nHearing\n8. At the hearing Mr Sharma confirmed that which he had said in his response,\nnamely that he did not object to the appointment of Mr Gardner as the manager\nfor the Property.\n9. That being said we determined whether Mr Garnder would be a suitable\ncandidate to taken on the role of manager. We had seen his CV. He told us he\nmanaged some 700 units in the Essex, Hertfordshire London region. He had a\nstaff of 6, including an accounts person, two assistants and three property\n\nmanagers. He had been appointed a manager of another property, 123\nWestbourne Park Road some three years ago. We had the opportunity to review\nhis level of fees, which were acceptable and are as set out in the attached Order.\nHe was aware of the insurance arrangements, it being undertaken by the head\nlessor with a 40% contribution from the leaseholders of the residential units.\n10. He confirmed his complaints procedures and that each tenant would have their\nown account and access via his company’s portal. There were emergency\nprocedures in place, and he had £1m cover for professional indemnity issues.\n11. He told us his priority would be to ensure all health and fire safety issues were\ninvestigated and if necessary, works undertaken to ensure compliance. He\nthought the windows in the common parts, access thereto and the post\narrangements needed swift attention. He would issue s20 notices in respect of\nthe decorating works to the landings.\n12. We touched on the accounting issues which had formed a large part of Mr\nCalay’s complaint. It appears that over the years Mr Sharma had paid certain\nexpenses himself, for example insurance for the Property and rather than\nclaiming back from the tenants had offset the payments against his liability for\nservice charge payments in respect of the 5 flats he owned. There had been little\nor no proper accounts until recently when one set accounts for the period 1 April\n2018 to 31 December 2024 were produced by Lever Bros & Co chartered\naccountants from Isleworth dated 3 March 2025. It is not clear whether a\ncomplaint demand for this period have ever been issued.\n13. We indicated that there should be a service charge review but only for the past\n18 months as there was real concern that the provisions of s20B would impact\non the recoverability of any arrears.\nDecision\n14. We concluded, as did our colleagues in 2024, that there were grounds to\nappoint Mr Gardner and were satisfied that he would fulfil the role.\n15. We prepared a draft order which was sent to both sides for comment, confined\nto the terms of the Order. The applicant raised no issues. Mr Sharma sent in a\nlengthy diatribe essentially making points that should have been considered at\nthe hearing if he was objecting to the appointment, which of course, he was not.\n16. We would ask Mr Gardner to note the contents as there may be issues that\nwould assist him with the management. We will leave it for him to liaise with\nMr Sharma, which includes whether Mr Gardner continues with Lever Bros &\nCo as accountants and how he deals with any alleged surplus of monies Mr\nSharma appears to be saying he is due from his payment of expenses said to be\nfrom his own resources. It may be that Lever Bros & Co can assist Mr Gardner\nin this element. We are not requiring Mr Gardner to indemnify Mr Sharma.\n\n17. We consider the period 15 August 2025 to 31 December 2028 should be\nsufficient for Mr Gardner to resolve outstanding issues. Before expiration of\nthat period any application for renewal will need to be made, or the\nappointment continues outside the tribunal’s involvement.\nJudge Dutton Date 29 July 2025\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of appeal they\nmay have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), then\na written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nregional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within 28\ndays after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person making the\napplication.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the\n28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide whether to\nallow the application for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the\ntime limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the tribunal to\nwhich it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number), state the grounds\nof appeal and state the result the party making the application is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber)."

On 10 December 2024 the Rent Officer registered a rent of £199.40\nper week, effective from 10 December 2024, which included services\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2021\n\nof £7.90 per week. Following an objection from the tenant to the\ndetermination of a fair rent by the Rent Officer, the Tribunal has\nmade a determination under the provisions of the Rent Act 1977.\n2. The last registered fair rent was £138.56 per week (which included\nservices of £1.56 per week), effective from 31 January 2020.\n3. Directions were issued on 19 March 2025 by the Tribunal. The parties\nwere directed to provide reply forms, and invited to submit any\nrelevant information and submissions.\n4. The Tribunal was informed on 25 April 2025 that the tenant wished\nto withdraw their application. A response was sent stating that the\ntenant would need to be informed that if a withdrawal form was not\nreceived, the Tribunal would proceed to determine the case. The\nTribunal wrote to the tenant on 25 April 2025 stating that a\nwithdrawal from would need to be completed and returned to the\nTribunal by 2 May 2025.\n5. The Tribunal did not inspect the Property but considered this case on\nthe basis of the papers provided by the parties and having regard to\nits own knowledge, expertise and online research.\nEvidence\n6. From the information provided, it appears that 12a Buckingham\nRoad, London, NW10 4RR (“the Property”) is a self-contained\nconverted flat on the ground floor with full central heating with two\nrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. The Property is let on a weekly\ntenancy which commenced on 20 August 1990.\n7. The tenancy is subject to s.11 Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Council\nTax is paid for by the tenant.\n8. No furniture has been provided by the Landlord.\n9. Neither party has submitted any comparable evidence.\nDetermination and Valuation\n10. Having consideration of the evidence and our own expert, general\nknowledge of rent values in the area, we consider that the open\nmarket rent for the Property in a good tenantable condition would be\n2\n\nin the region of £357.69 per week. From this level of rent we have\nmade adjustments in relation to:\n(a) The repairing obligations as set out above – tenant responsible for\ninternal decorations;\n(b) No furniture provided by the Landlord;\n(c) White goods, curtains, carpet and floor coverings provided by the\nTenant\n(d) Condition of the property\n11. The landlord has provided details of the services provided at a charge\nof £7.90 per week. The services are:\nSVC Electricity £3.39\nSVC (AMT) Fire Risk Assessment £3.478\nBlock management fees £0.51\nCore management fees £0.53\n12. The full valuation is shown below:\nPer week\nMarket rent £357.69\nLess deductions as above 10% -£35.77\nAdjusted rent £321.90\nLess scarcity 20% -£64.38\nFair rent £257.52\n3\n\n13. The Tribunal therefore determines a rent of £257.52 per week for the\npurposes of s.70.\nDecision\n14. The uncapped fair rent initially determined by the Tribunal for the\npurposes of s.70 was £257.52 per week. The capped rent for the\nproperty according to the provisions of the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair\nRent) Order 1999 is calculated at £200.40 per week. The calculation\nof the capped rent is shown on the decision form. In this case, the\nlower rent of £200.40 per week is to be registered as the fair rent for\nthis property.\nName: Judge Sarah McKeown Date: 12 May 2025\nAPPEAL PROVISIONS\nThese summary reasons are provided to give the parties and indication as to\nhow the Tribunal made its decision. If either party wishes to appeal this\ndecision, they should first make a request for full reasons and the details of how\nto appeal will be set out in the full reasons. Any subsequent application for\npermission to appeal should be made on Form RP PTA.\n4"

Hamilton-Farey\nTribunal :\nMs. S. Coughlin MCIEH\nDate and venue of 17th June 2019\n:\nhearing 10 Alfred Place, London WC1E 7LR\nDate of decision : 1 July 2019\nDECISION\nOn 12 February 2019 the Respondent served a Final Financial Penalty Notice\n(“FPO2) on the joint Applicants under section 249A of the Housing Act 2004\nrequiring Dr. Ogatimirin to pay £2,500.00 and Mrs. Ogatimirin to pay\n£5,000.00 The Applicants appealed against the Notice under Schedule 13A of\nthe Act.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nHaving heard the evidence and submissions from the parties, the tribunal\ndetermines that the appeal should be dismissed.\nReasons\n1. The subject property is jointly owned by Dr. and Mrs. Ogatimirin. On\n17 June 2016 a selective licence was issued in respect of the property for\na period of one year. No appeal was made against the terms of this\nlicence.\n2. On 8 May 2017, the respondents reminded the applicants that the\nlicence was due to expire, and they were therefore required to re-\nlicence the property. The applicants did not re-apply for a licence with\nthe consequence that the licence expired on 16 June 2017.\n3. The tribunal has been provided with copies of warning letters to the\napplicants from the respondents in relation to the lack of licence, and a\nfinal warning was sent on 8 November 2018.\n4. The respondents inspected the property twice in December 2018 and\nfound the property to be in occupation by Abiodun Ayeni and family.\nTheir occupation was subject to an assured shorthold tenancy, a copy of\nwhich was provided to the tribunal.\n5. A Notice of Intent to issue a financial penalty was served on the\napplicants on 19 December 2018, having received an application for a\nselective licence the day before. It was the respondents’ case that the\noffence had been committed on 10 December 2018.\n6. Correspondence was exchanged between the parties during January\nand February 2019, with the result that the Financial Penalty Notices\nwere served on 12 February 2019.\n7. A five-year selective licence was issued by the respondents on 14\nFebruary 2019.\n8. The applicants do not deny that the property was occupied by tenants\non 10 and 13 December 2018. The applicants’ case is that, first of all no\nFPO should have been served on Mrs. Ogatimirin because she was not\nresponsible for the property. However, the tribunal noted from the\nOffice Copy Entries provided that the applicants were joint freeholders\nof the property and were therefore both in control/management of an\nunlicensed property no matter what the personal arrangements they\nmade between them. We were also told that the rent received paid the\njoint mortgage on the property. We are satisfied that both applicants\nare therefore liable for any penalty due to the lack of licensing.\n9. The applicants said they had not experienced the grant of a one-year\nlicence before, and having paid the £500.00 for a five-year term,\nexpected to receive one, as they had done for their other properties in\nBarking and Dagenham. The applicants say that, if the licence was for\nonly one year, they should have only paid a proportion of the fee for a\n2\n\nfive-year licence. It was explained by Ms. Bull that the fee charged was\nnot linked in any way to the length of the licence granted, and the same\nfee was payable whether or not a licence was granted, or one for any\nterm up to five years. The licence was issued for a period of one year\nonly because the applicants had failed to provide details relating to\ntheir ability to fund repairs to the property when requested.\n10. We are satisfied that the fee payable is not linked to the length of the\nlicence, and therefore there is no refund due to the applicants for\nhaving only received an initial one-year licence.\n11. The main thrust of the applicants’ argument is that they had a\nreasonable excuse for the failure to licence as they did not receive either\na copy of the first licence or any of the correspondence relating to the\nlicensing of the property from the respondents during the period from\n2017 (when the licence was due to expire) until 2019 when they were\nserved with the FPOs. Dr Ogatimirin stated that he checked the\nRespondent’s on line database regularly to check on the progress of the\noriginal licence application and believed that the application was still\nongoing. We were shown copies of the letters which the applicants said\nwere not received and noted they had been served on the subject\nproperty, on the hairdresser below (which was owned and managed by\nthe applicants) as well as an address in Avondale Court, which had\nbeen given by the applicants as one of their contact addresses.\n12. The applicants did not dispute that any of the addresses were valid but\nmaintained they had not received anything from the respondents.\n13. Dr. Ogatimirin told us that, he was often away from the property\nlooking after a sick relative in Nigeria, but that during his periods of\nabsence, his wife and his children checked the post box and went to the\nproperty on a regular basis.. He said that neither his wife, nor his\nchildren had received anything from the respondents.\n14. In addition to their claim that no correspondence had been received,\nMr. Ogatimirin also said that he did not understand how the fines had\nbeen calculated, and he had also received an invoice for £237.50, which\nhe did not understand, and had not paid.\n15. Ms. Bull took us through the matrix used by the respondents, and\nwhich was based on the statutory guidance ‘Civil penalties under the\nHousing and Planning act 2016 – Guidance for Local Housing\nAuthorities’ when determining the level of penalty.\n16. We were taken through the matrix and were able to see that the\ndifferential in the FPO was due to the fact that Dr. Ogatimirin was\nconsidered to be a medium risk of further offending, whereas his wife\nhad accepted a caution in 2015 under the Housing Act 2004 for failing\nto licence 63 Avondale Court, Avondale Road, London E16 4PU.\n17. This evidence was not disputed by either of the applicants, and we\nconsider that given the previous offence by Mrs. Ogatimirin, that there\nshould be a differential in the FPO served.\n18. With respect to the invoice for £237.5o, this was a completely different\nmatter and the invoice related to a Disrepair Notice that had been\n3\n\nserved under S.49 of the Act and is not related to the FPO’s\nsubsequently issued.\n19. Having heard all of the evidence, we are not satisfied that the\napplicants’ case can succeed. Their ignorance of the law is not an\nexcuse for not licencing the property, nor does it seem plausible to the\ntribunal that no correspondence was received from the respondents at\nall as has been claimed. If the applicants were to be away for any\nperiod of time, then it was for them to ensure that correspondence by\nwhatever method was received and dealt with. We are satisfied that the\nproperty was not licensed when the Respondent inspected in December\n2018 and should have been licensed. and on balance we are satisfied\nthat the applicants did not have a reasonable excuse for the failure to\nlicence.\n20. The applicants said that they considered the FPO’s to be too high,\nhowever it was brought to their attention during the hearing the\nlegislation enables a fine of up to £30,000.\n21. We consider the amount of the penalty is relatively modest compared\nto this statutory maximum of £30,000And that the financial penalty of\n£2,500 in relation to Dr. Ogatimirin and £5,000 in relation to Mrs.\nOgatimirin are proportionate to the circumstances of the Applicant’s\noffence.\nTribunal: Ms. A. Hamilton-Farey. Date: 1 July 2019.\n4"

The form of remote hearing was V: CVPREMOTE. A face-to-face\nhearing was not held because it was not practicable, and all issues could be\ndetermined in a remote hearing. The documents that the tribunal were referred\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nto are in four bundles containing pp 1-471 the contents of which the tribunal has\ntaken into consideration.\n____________________________________________________\nSummary of the tribunal’s decision\n(1) The premium payable for the freehold including the Additional Property\nis £8,000.\n_____________________________________________________\nBackground\n1. This is an application made by the applicant leaseholder pursuant to\nsection 24(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development\nAct 1993 (‘the 1993 Act’) for a determination of the premium to be paid\nfor the purchase of the freehold of 77-82 Bridle Close, London EN 6EB\n(‘the property’).\n2. By an Initial Notice served pursuant to section 13 of the Act dated 2 April\n2020, the applicant exercised the right to acquire the freehold of the\nsubject property together with the ‘additional property’ identified on the\nplan accompanying the notice for a premium of £9,500 for the freehold\nand £500.00 for the ‘additional property.’ In as counter notice dated 11\nJune 2020 the respondent contended the premium payable for the\nsubject property and additional property was £380,800.\n3. In an application dated 9 December 2020 the applicant applied to the\ntribunal for a determination of the premium payable.\nThe issues\nMatters agreed\n4. The following matters were agreed in a Statement of Agreed Facts and\nIssues dated 2 June 2021\n(a) The subject property is a purpose-built block of six flats over two\nfloors with four 2-bedroom flats with a GIA of between 650sqft\nand 725sqft and two 1-bedroom flats with a GIA of approximately\n550sqft.\n(b) Each of the leases are held for a term of 999 years from 25 March\n1963 with approximately 942 years unexpired as at the valuation\ndate.\n(c) The valuation date is 16 June 2020.*\n2\n\n(d) Flats 78,81 and 82 each pay a fixed ground rent throughout the\nterm of £15 15 shillings (£15.75) and flats 77, 79 and 80 each pay\na fixed ground rent throughout the term of £100 per annum.\n(e) The FHVP’s for each 2-bedroom flat is £287.00 and £240,000 for\neach 1-bedroom flat.\n(f) Capitalisation of ground rent is 6%. Value of ground rent agreed\nat hearing is £5,788.\n(g) Deferment rate is 5%.\n(h) There is £nil marriage value payable.\n*Subsequently, it was agreed that the correct valuation date was 6\nApril 2020 but that this made no difference to the expert’s valuations or\nthe parties’ legal arguments.\nMatters not agreed\n5. The following matters were issues to be determined by the tribunal:\n(a) Whether the Nominee Purchasers (‘NP’) Notice of Claim is valid?\n(b) Whether the tenants have express rights over that garden areas\nthat have been claimed as ‘Additional Property.’\n(c) If the claim is valid, the development value of the roof space.\n(d) If the claim is valid, the quantum of other compensation (if any)\npayable arising from the freeholder’s ownership of two sister\nblocks.\n(e) If the claim is valid, then the quantum of value arising from the\nexisting potential for the respondent to sell Deeds of Variation or\nnew leases to permitting subletting (which is currently prohibited\nunder the leases.\n(f) If the claim is valid, the price payable for the freehold.\nThe hearing\n6. The hearing in this matter took place over 7 and 8 December 2021. The\napplicant was represented by Mr Edward Blakeney of counsel and the\nrespondent was represented by Mr John Yianni of counsel.\n3\n\n7. Neither party asked the tribunal to inspect the property and the tribunal\ndid not consider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection to make\nits determination, as it was provided with photographs of the exterior\nand internal common parts of the property as well as a map of its location\nand lease plan showing its position and physical relationship to the two\nsister blocks, of which the respondent is also the freeholder.\n8. The applicant relied upon the expert report and valuation of Mr Peter\nLoizou MRICS dated 22 November 2021 in which he calculated the\npremium payable was £7,423 (corrected at the hearing to £7,243) with\n£500 payable for the Additional Property or £8,000 in total. The\nrespondent relied upon the expert report and valuation report of Mr\nJason Mellor AssocRICS DipSurvPrac dated November 2021 in which he\nhad calculated the premium payable as £138,000 including the\nAdditional Property.\nThe tribunal’s decisions and reasons\nWhether the Nominee Purchasers (‘NP’) Notice of Claim is valid and\nwhether the tenants have express rights over that garden areas that\nhave been claimed as ‘Additional Property’?\n9. The tribunal determines that the Initial Notice of Claim is valid and\nincludes garden areas as marked on the accompanying plan to which the\napplicant is entitled to acquire. The tribunal does not accept the\nargument of the respondent that the notice is invalidated by the\napplicant’s failure to identify the basis upon which the Additional\nProperty can be said to be appurtenant property which has either been\ndemised under the terms of the leases or which is used in common with\nthe lessees of other premises.\n10. The tribunal accepts the applicant’s argument that the leases contain\nexpress provisions as to the tenants’ use of the garden area that are set\nout in clauses 2(1)(b), 4(2) and paragraph 3 of The Third Schedule, and\nwhich in the tribunal’s opinion, clearly indicate that the tenants have use\nof the garden and are required to contribute towards their upkeep. The\ntribunal finds the lease does not contain any express prohibition on the\nuse of the garden areas by tenants or require a specific fee to be paid for\ntheir use. Therefore, the tribunal finds the applicant is entitled to claim\nthe Additional Property as marked on the plan, pursuant to s.1(3)(b) of\nthe 1993 Act; Marks & Spencer plc v Paribas Security Services Trust\nCompany (Jersey) Limited [2015] UKSC 72.\n11. In light of its decision above, the tribunal is not required to consider\nwhether there has been an ‘overclaim’ by the applicant, which may or\nmay not invalidate the Notice of Claim.\n4\n\nThe development value of the roof space\n12. The tribunal finds that although there is development value in the roof\nspace at the property, the cost benefit is likely to be minimal and\ntherefore, determines that the monetary value to the premium payable\nis zero.\n13. Overall, the tribunal prefers the evidence of Mr Mellor and his ‘top down’\napproach, which relies on assessing development value by reference to\nmarket evidence either from the subject or comparable sites. This\napproach contrasted to that of Mr Loizou who stated that because there\nwas no ‘pre-application’ approval for development in place by the\nValuation Date, the development value must be zero.\n14. The tribunal finds that the agreed floor areas for each of the lower floors\nwere 2x 2 beds, 725 sqft each and 1x 1 bed, 650 sqft i.e., a total GIA of\n2100 sqft. However, in the top-down approach used by Mr Mellor in his\noption 1 valuation, a square footage of only 1065 has been used to\ncalculate the construction costs of £350 psqft and does not allow for the\nremainder of the floor space in the roof. This amounts to another 1000\nsqft plus that has not been accounted for in the development costs\nalthough the totality of the area will require major works for the\ndevelopment to take place.\n15. Therefore, the tribunal finds Mr Mellor has kept the construction costs\nof potential roof development on the artificially low side by ignoring the\nwhole of the floor area that would be required to be developed for the\nnew flats and resulting in a total construction cost of £315,000.\n16. The tribunal calculates that by using £350 psqf as an estimate for the\ncosts of the flats themselves, this provides a figure of £372,750. Using\nits knowledge and expertise, the tribunal considers that, even if a low\nestimate of £100 psqf is adopted for the considerable amount of work on\nthe remainder of the roof space is used, including the extra support along\nthe entire outer edges for the dormers, this produces a figure of\n£100,000, the result of which would be a total construction cost of\n£472,750 or £225 psqft over the entire 2100 sqft roof space. Although\nthis is less than the anticipated sales receipt of £560,000, it is likely the\nremaining £87,250 would quickly be into negative values after\nallowances are made for the other deductions suggested by the\nrespondent in his report. These are likely to include sales and legal costs\nat 3% (£16,800); profit and risk at 15% at least (£84,000); finance at 8%;\nCIL payments; planning and legal risks at 40% (at least) and professional\nadvice/surveys etc (£10,000.\n17. The tribunal finds that there is both a significant legal risk in developing\nthe roof space and a planning risk that can be assessed as being in the\nregion of 40% at least. Mr Mellor had assessed the value of the roof\ndevelopment works at £50,000 but the tribunal finds these are more\nlikely to be in the region of over £80,000 as set out above. The tribunal\n5\n\nalso finds that reliance on the tribunal decision in\nLON/00AE/OCE/2019/0059 concerning 1-36 Fairfield Close, N12 is\nnow outdated, particularly considering the circumstances prevailing\nsince 2020 in the pandemic crisis and is therefore of limited assistance.\nThe quantum of other compensation (if any) payable arising from\nthe freeholder’s ownership of two sister blocks\n18. The tribunal determines that no other sums of compensation are\npayable.\n19. Mr Mellor submitted that there was development value in the\nrespondent’s ability to develop the two neighbouring ‘sister’ blocks of\nwhich the respondent was also the freeholder. The respondent asserted\nthat the respondent’s loss of ability to apply for planning permission on\nall three blocks raises the risk that planning permission would be refused\nif uniformity could not be achieved and attributed a sum of £2,000 to\nthis risk of loss (revised from his original figure of £22,000).\n20. In contrast, Mr Loizou asserted that the freeholder remained capable of\ndeveloping the two sister blocks and therefore, no compensation was\npayable.\n21. The tribunal prefers the argument made by Mr Blakeney on this issue\nthat no further compensation is payable, and accepts his argument that\nsuch additional compensation’ is calculated at the date of the initial\nnotice and relates to the diminution in value of the respondent’s interest\nin other property resulting from the acquisition of the subject property\nand any loss that may result from it\n22. The tribunal find that the subject property and its two sister blocks\ndisplay no special characteristics and are in an area of varying\narchitecture and development. Therefore, the tribunal does not accept\nthe respondent’s argument that it is less likely to obtain planning\npermission approval if all three blocks are not developed simultaneously\nor in an identical fashion and there suffer a financial loss.\nThe quantum of value arising from the existing potential for the\nrespondent to sell Deeds of Variation or new leases to permitting\nsubletting (which is currently prohibited under the leases).\n23. The tribunal finds the leases in their current form allow subletting to one\nhousehold and prohibits subletting to persons that make up multiple\nhouseholds and prohibits short-term (holiday) lets. The tribunal\ndetermine that there is minimal value to be attributed to the premium in\nrespect of this issue.\n6\n\n24. Clause 2(2)((xvi) of the lease’s states:\nThat the Tenant will at all times during the said term keep and\noccupy the said flat hereby demised as and for a single private\nresidence in one occupation only; Triplerose v Beattie [2020]\nUKUT 180 (LC)\n25. In his report Mr Mellor asserted that this clause restricted the use of the\nflat to the tenant only and prohibited sub-letting and therefore\ncompensation would be payable for the variation of this clause by way of\na Deed of Variation or the grant of new leases and attributed a value of\n£60,000 to the removal of the prohibition on sub-letting.\n26. Mr Loizou stated in his report that any costs payable by leaseholders for\nthe lifting of such a restriction would be limited to covering the\nreasonable professional fees of the landlord in considering such an\napplication as opposed to a mechanism for profiting from it. However,\nthe current block management policy does not permit the lifting of such\na restriction and therefore no further compensation is payable.\n27. Mr Blakeney for the applicant submitted that this clause was aimed only\nat preventing short-term holiday lets, rather than sub-letting in its\nentirety and that the previous decisions in the tribunal and the\nEdmonton county court dated 23 July 2001, confirming the prohibition\non sub-letting, were determined prior to Triplerose v Beattie [2020]\nUKUT 180 (LC) are not binding on the tribunal and may have been\nwrongly decided.\n28. The tribunal was made aware of decisions of the county court and the\ntribunal that determined this clause to prohibit the sub-letting of the\nflats finding this to be a natural interpretation of this clause preventing\nthe sub-letting to persons that do not form a single family. However, the\ntribunal is of the view that this does not require this to be the lessee’s\nfamily only.\nThe price payable for the freehold and the price payable for the\nAdditional Property\n29. In conclusion, the tribunal determines the price payable for the freehold\nof the subject and additional property is £8,000 as per the valuation of\nMr Loizou.\nName: Judge Tagliavini Date: 21 January 2022\n7\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e., give the date, the property, and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n8\n\nCASE REFERENCE LON/00AC/OLR/2014/0106\nFirst-tier Tribunal\nProperty Chamber (Residential Property)\nValuation under Schedule 13 of the Leasehold Reform Housing and\nUrban Development Act 1993\nPremium payable for an extended leasehold Interest in [Property]\nValuation date: [Date]\n9"

Arain\nDate and Venue of : Not applicable, paper determination\nHearing\nDate of Decision : 29 October 2018\n____________________________________________________________\nDECISION\n____________________________________________________________\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2018\n1\n\n1 The Fair Rent is determined at £64.00 (Sixty Four Pounds) per week from 29 October\n2018.\nREASONS\nIntroduction\n2 Mrs Williams holds a protected tenancy of 205 Trysull Road, Wolverhampton, West\nMidlands, WV3 7JP. The rent had previously been registered by the Rent Officer at\n£58.00 per week on 2 August 2016 to take effect on 13 September 2016. On 14 June 2018\nthe landlord applied for an increase to £69.60 per week and on 8 August 2018 the Rent\nOfficer registered a new rent of £61.00 per week to take effect on 13 September 2018.\n3 The landlord appealed against the Decision by letter to the Valuation Office Agency dated 10\nSeptember 2018 and the matter was referred to the First-tier Tribunal for Determination.\nThe Tribunal inspected the property and reached its decision on 29 October 2018 and the\nDecision papers were sent to the parties. On 2 November 2018 the Tribunal received a letter\nfrom the landlord's agents Grainger plc requesting reasons which are the subject of this\ndocument.\nThe Law\n4 Mrs Williams is a protected tenant as acknowledged by the landlord. We have not been\nprovided with a copy of the tenancy agreement but understand the property had been let\nunfurnished with the landlord responsible for repairs to the structure and exterior and the\ntenant for internal decorations in accordance with s.11 of the Landlord & Tenant Act 1985.\n5 Accordingly, the rent falls to be determined in accordance with s.70 of the Rent Act 1977.\n6 S.70(1) states that in determining a fair rent, regard has to be had to all the circumstances\nof the tenancy (other than personal circumstances) including the age, character, locality\nand state of repair of the house, whether the property is let furnished and whether a\npremium had been paid or would be required to renew, continue or assign the tenancy.\n7 s.70(2) adds a further qualification that it is assumed that the number of parties seeking to\nbecome tenants of similar houses in the locality on the terms of the tenancy (other than the\nrent) is not substantially greater than the number of houses available to let on such terms.\nThis is usually referred to as 'scarcity' and the Court of Appeal held in Spath Holme Ltd. v\nChairman of the Greater Manchester Rent Assessment Committee (1995) 28 HLR 107 and\nCurtis v London Rent Assessment Committee (1999) QB 92 that under normal\ncircumstances the fair rent is the market rent discounted for scarcity. The Court also held\nthat assured tenancy rents could be considered comparable to market rents.\n8 s.70(3) requires the valuation to disregard any disrepair due to a tenant's failure to comply\nwith the terms of the tenancy and any improvements carried out by either the tenant or\ntheir predecessor in title.\nFacts Found\n9 The Tribunal inspected the property on 29 October 2018 and found it to be in fair\ncondition. It is a two bedroom end terraced house in a residential part of Wolverhampton\nwithin walking distance of local shops and facilities.\n2\n\n10 The accommodation comprises a living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom on the\nground floor with a landing and two bedrooms on the first floor. The loft has been\nconverted to a playroom / store but it is accessed from a steep staircase from the back\nbedroom with limited headroom and is only used for storage. The house is set back from\nthe pavement behind a front garden with room to park a car in the drive. The tenant has\nbuilt a DIY store to the side of the wing which is an improvement to be disregarded from\nthe valuation. The back garden has a small lawn and shed built by the tenant.\n11 Mrs Williams advised that she and her late husband had rented the house many years ago\nand carried out extensive improvements. At the time, it was effectively a shell with very\nbasic amenities such as only two power points in the property and no hot water supply.\nThey had it re-wired, installed a hot water supply, fitted kitchen and bathroom suites,\nconverted the loft, built the side store, installed some double glazing and redecorated\nthroughout, all of which are to be disregarded from the valuation and the house is valued\non the assumption that it remains in original condition.\nSubmissions\n12 Neither party requested a Hearing.\n13 The landlord's agents sent a written submission referring to a house in Finchfield,\nWolverhampton they regarded as comparable. The letting information referred to a fully\nfitted kitchen and bathroom with a shower, new carpets in part of the accommodation,\ngas-fired central heating and a location in a 'sought after residential area'. The asking rent\nwas £127.00 per week.\nThey regarded the Finchfield house as better and to put it on a comparable basis deducted\n£50.00 per week for the lack of central heating, modernised kitchen and bathroom suites,\nfloor coverings and white goods. They made no deduction for scarcity and requested a fair\nrent of £69.60 per week.\n14 Mrs Williams sent a letter by way of submission, drawing attention to the improvements\nshe and her late husband had carried out.\nDecision\n15 To assess the Fair Rent the Tribunal need to assess the rental value of the house in good\ncondition as a starting point, assuming it had been well maintained and modernised with\ncentral heating, reasonable kitchen units and a bathroom suite in fair condition, fully\nequipped with carpets and curtains and ready to let in the open market.\n16 Based on the evidence supplied by Grainger and the Tribunal's own general knowledge and\nexperience, the Tribunal assessed the market rent in good condition at £127.00 per week.\n17 However, it had not been let in that condition, the tenant had been there for many years\nand the house needed refurbishment. The Tribunal accepted Grainger's submission of £50\nfor lack of amenities and tenants' improvements detailed above at paragraph 11 to leave a\nnet rent of £72.00 per week.\n18 The Committee considered the question of scarcity in s.70(2) of the Rent Act 1977 and\nfound that the number of potential tenants looking for accommodation of this type in the\n3\n\narea would have been significantly greater than the number of units available to let. The\nTribunal found there was excess demand and deducted £8.00 from the market rent to\narrive at the statutory basis for a fair rent.\n19 Deducting £8.00 for scarcity left a net rent of £64.00 per week.\n20 The Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 was not relevant as the Fair Rent was less\nthan the capped increase that may have been permitted by the Order, set out in the papers\nsent to the parties with the Decision Notice.\n21 There were no services to take into account.\n22 Accordingly, the Tribunal determined the Fair Rent at £64.00 (Sixty Four Pounds) per\nweek with effect from 29 October 2018.\nI.D. Humphries B.Sc.(Est.Man.) FRICS\nChairman\n10th December 2018\n4"

Following an objection from the Landlord to the determination of a fair\nrent by the Rent Officer, the Tribunal has made a determination under the\nprovisions of the Rent Act 1977.\nInspection\n2. The Tribunal did not inspect the property. The property comprises a\nbasement self-contained converted flat, without central heating, comprising of\ntwo rooms, one kitchen and one bathroom/ WC. The property also has a garden\nwhich is shared.\nEvidence\n3. The Tribunal has had consideration of the written submissions provided\nby the Tenant and the Landlord.\nDetermination and Valuation\n4. Having consideration of any comparable evidence proved by the parties and\nour own expert, general knowledge of rental values in the area, we consider that\nthe open market rent for the property in good tenantable condition would be in\nthe region of £1200.00 per calendar month From this level of rent we have\nmade adjustments in relation to: the improvements and disrepair of the\nproperty.\n5. The Tribunal has also made an adjustment for scarcity of 20%.\n6. The full valuation is shown below:\nMarket Rent £1200.00 per calendar month\nLess\nTenants' responsibility for internal decoration\nDeduct 5%\nTenants' responsibility for white goods, carpets/curtains\nDeduct 5%\nDisrepair- water damage- kitchen ceiling collapse – bathroom ceiling damage-\ngarden door damaged- loss of exclusivity of garden – removal of sound\ninsulation- no working oven- no own entrance.\nDeduct 35%\nDeduct £540 pcm\nSubtotal £660 pcm\nLess\nScarcity 20%\nSub total £528 pcm\n2\n\n7. The Tribunal determines a rent of £528 per calendar month which\nis equivalent to £121.00 pw.\nDecision\n8. The uncapped fair rent initially determined by the Tribunal, for the purposes\nof section 70, was £121.00 per week. The capped rent for the property\naccording to the provisions of the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999\nis calculated at £166.50 per week. The calculation of the capped rent is shown\non the decision form. In this case the lower rent of £121.00 per week is to be\nregistered as the fair rent or this property from 20 May 2025.\nChairman: R Waterhouse FRICS Date: 20 May 2025\nAPPEAL PROVISIONS\nThese summary reasons are provided to give the parties an indication as to how\nthe Tribunal made its decision. If either party wishes to appeal this decision,\nthey should first make a request for full reasons and the details of how to appeal\nwill be set out in the full reasons. Any request for full reasons should be made\nwithin a month. Any subsequent application for permission to appeal should be\nmade on Form RP PTA\n3"

On 5 July 2024 the tenant referred to the Tribunal a notice of increase\nof rent served by the landlord under section 13 of the Housing Act\n1988.\n2. The landlord's notice, which was served on 12 June 2024, proposed a\nrent of £1,925 per month with effect from 19 July 2024 in place of the\nexisting rent of £1,875 per month.\n3. The tenant has a statutory tenancy following the expiry of a tenancy for\ntwelve months from 19 July 2023.\n4. Directions were issued by the tribunal on 15 August 2024.\n5. Prior to the hearing both the landlord and the tenant sent submissions\nto the tribunal and the other party.\nThe Evidence\n6. The tenant in written submissions stated that the flat which comprises\ntwo rooms, kitchen and bathroom/wc, is on the second floor of the\nblock but without the benefit of a lift. The tenant confirmed that the flat\nwas in good condition having been refurbished in July 2022.\n7. However, the extractor in the kitchen vented into the area above the\nkitchen units rather than to outside. Following an inspection the tenant\nwas advised that the hole in the wall had not been utilised when the\nextractor had been fitted. The landlord had been advised of this\nhowever had responded that the extractor had an internal filter\ntherefore did not need an outlet through the hole in the wall. It was\nalleged that both the living room and bedroom held moisture resulting\nin the tenant using dehumidifiers all year round. The tenant stated that\na representative of the landlord had advised that other than putting on\nthe radiators and opening the windows there was no remedy as the\nbuilding and its brickwork were old.\n8. The tenant referred to three one bedroom flats within Dibdin House at\nasking rents of £1,650 and £1,675 and a two bedroom flat within the\ndevelopment at an asking rent of £500 per week and several flats\nwithin a quarter a mile of the development at asking rents of £1,700 per\nmonth.\n9. The landlord described the property as having been refurbished to a\ngood standard in July 2022 to include new kitchen units with\nintegrated appliances, new bathroom suite, combination boiler and\nradiators and flooring throughout.\n10. The landlord stated that there were no known items of repair\noutstanding. The landlord also stated that there were many one\nbedroom flats in the area at rents in excess of the asking rent.\n2\n\nThe law\n11. In accordance with the terms of section 14 Housing Act 1988 I\nproceeded to determine the rent at which I considered that the subject\nproperty might reasonably be expected to be let on the open market by\na willing landlord under an assured tenancy.\n12. In so doing I, as required by section 14(1), ignored the effect on the\nrental value of the property of any relevant tenant's improvements as\ndefined in section 14(2) of that Act or any diminution in value due to\nthe tenant not complying with the terms of the tenancy and also any\nitems of disrepair which either the tenant had not reported to the\nlandlord or had not allowed access for the landlord to carry out the\nnecessary repairs.\nValuation\n13. In coming to my decision, I relied on the tenant’s comparable evidence\nand my own general knowledge of rents in Maida Vale since the\nlandlord had not provided any comparable evidence.\n14. The comparable evidence in respect of the one bedroom flats in Dibdin\nHouse was several months old and less than the tenant had paid at the\ncommencement of the tenancy. However, the landlord has not\nproduced any evidence to support the assertion that rents for similar\nflats are higher than the proposed rent. Furthermore, there is the\nmatter of the inefficient extractor in the kitchen which does not remove\nthe moisture laden air from the kitchen and the humidity in the living\nand bedroom, requiring the use of dehumidifiers all year long.\n15. I determined that the open market rent without these issues was £1,925\nper month however the open market rent as at 19 July 2024 subject to\nthe deficiencies resulting in some dampness is £1,875 per month.\nThe decision\n16. The rent of £1,875 per month is effective from 19 July 2024 in\naccordance with the landlord’s notice.\nChairman: Evelyn Flint Dated: 9 October 2024\nANNEX - RIGHTS OF APPEAL\nI. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to\nthe First-tier Tribunal at the Regional Office which has been dealing\nwith the case. The application should be made on Form RP PTA\navailable at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-rp-\npta-application-for-permission-to-appeal-a-decision-to-the-upper-\ntribunal-lands-chamber\n3\n\nII. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the Regional\nOffice within 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the\ndecision to the person making the application.\nIII. If the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\nfor permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the time\nlimit.\nIV. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the\ncase number), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking. Please note that if you are seeking\npermission to appeal against a decision made by the Tribunal under the\nRent Act 1977, the Housing Act 1988 or the Local Government and\nHousing Act 1989, this can only be on a point of law.\nAppendix\nHousing Act 1988\n14 Determination of rent by rent assessment committee.\n(1)Where, under subsection (4) (a) of section 13, a tenant refers to a rent\nassessment committee a notice under subsection (2) of that section, the\ncommittee shall determine the rent at which, subject to subsections (2) and\n(4) below, the committee consider that the dwelling-house concerned might\nreasonably be expected to be let in the open market by a willing landlord\nunder an assured tenancy—\n(a) which is a periodic tenancy having the same periods as those of the\ntenancy to which the notice relates;\n(b) which begins at the beginning of the new period specified in the notice;\n(c) the terms of which (other than relating to the amount of the rent) are the\nsame as those of the tenancy to which the notice relates; and\n(d) in respect of which the same notices, if any, have been given under any of\nGrounds 1 to 5 of Schedule 2 to this Act, as have been given (or have effect as if\ngiven) in relation to the tenancy to which the notice relates.\n(2) In making a determination under this section, there shall be disregarded—\n(a) any effect on the rent attributable to the granting of a tenancy to a sitting\ntenant;\n(b) any increase in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a relevant\nimprovement carried out by a person who at the time it was carried out was\nthe tenant, if the improvement—\n(i) was carried out otherwise than in pursuance of an obligation to his\nimmediate landlord, or\n4\n\n(ii) was carried out pursuant to an obligation to his immediate landlord being\nan obligation which did not relate to the specific improvement concerned but\narose by reference to consent given to the carrying out of that improvement;\nand\n(c) any reduction in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a failure by\nthe tenant to comply with any terms of the tenancy.\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) above, in relation to a notice which is\nreferred by a tenant as mentioned in subsection (1) above, an improvement is\na relevant improvement if either it was carried out during the tenancy to\nwhich the notice relates or the following conditions are satisfied, namely—\n(a) that it was carried out not more than twenty-one years before the date of\nservice of the notice; and\n(b) that, at all times during the period beginning when the improvement was\ncarried out and ending on the date of service of the notice, the dwelling-house\nhas been let under an assured tenancy; and\n(c) that, on the coming to an end of an assured tenancy at any time during that\nperiod, the tenant (or, in the case of joint tenants, at least one of them) did not\nquit.\n(4)In this section “rent” does not include any service charge, within the\nmeaning of section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, but, subject to\nthat, includes any sums payable by the tenant to the landlord on account of\nthe use of furniture or for any of the matters referred to in subsection (1) (a) of\nthat section, whether or not those sums are separate from the sums payable\nfor the occupation of the dwelling-house concerned or are payable under\nseparate agreements….\n(7)Where a notice under section 13(2) above has been referred to the\nappropriate tribunal, then, unless the landlord and the tenant otherwise agree,\nthe rent determined by the appropriate tribunal … shall be the rent under the\ntenancy with effect from the beginning of the new period specified in the\nnotice or, if it appears to the appropriate tribunal that that would cause undue\nhardship to the tenant, with effect from such later date (not being later than\nthe date the rent is determined) as the appropriate tribunal may direct.\n5\n\n6"

The outstanding sums are £3,790.58 for\n2022/23 and £2,949.39 for 2023/24, a total of £6,739.97.\n(2) Since the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over county court costs and\ninterest, this matter should now be referred back to the County Court\nat the Mayors and City of London Court.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nThe Application\n1. On 29 April 2024, the London Borough of Southwark (\"the Applicant\")\nissued a claim form in the Civil National Business Centre seeking a\nmoney judgment in the sum of £6,889.97 in respect of arrears of service\ncharges and interest of £506.06 (at p.31-35 to the Bundle). Arrears of\nservice charges of £3,940.58 are claimed for 2022/23 and £2,949.39 for\n2023/24.\n2. On 14 May 2024, Ms Auta Nkem Lazarus (\"the Respondent\") filed a\nDefence and Counterclaim (p.124-129). She admitted that a sum of\n£3,056.70 was payable. She disputed her liability for the remainder. She\ndisputed the level of the service charges which were much higher than\nthe sums charged to secure tenants. She had been trying to sell her flat,\nbut had lost a buyer in 2020 because of the state of her flat. She referred\nto three former County Court judgments which had been settled by her\nmortgagee. She had accumulated debts of £30,000 and was still trying\nto sell her flat.\n3. On 23 January 2025 (p.152), DDJ Althaus, sitting in the County Court at\nthe Mayors and City of London Court transferred the case to this\ntribunal.\n4. On 13 March 2025 (p.1-5), this tribunal gave Directions at a Case\nManagement Hearing. The Procedural Judge noted that the Applicant\nhad applied to transfer the case back to the County Court as the action\nwas straight forward debt action. The Tribunal refused this application\non the ground that the Applicant had not appealed against the County\nCourt Order. The Applicant confirmed that the claim only related to the\nservice charge years 2022/23 and 2023/24. The claim for 2023/24 was\nfor an interim service charge.\n5. On 5 June 2025 (p.36-44), the Respondent filed her Statement of Case.\nShe complained that the service charges were unreasonable and not\npayable in full. No services or maintenance had been provided to her flat\nor the building. She was living in a street property, but was being charged\nestate-type charges. She was being charged for heating and hot water\nthat was not being provided. There had been a history of failure to carry\nout repairs, poor management and unresolved complaints. There were\ninconsistencies in her service charge account. She provided a Scott\nSchedule. Her ground of challenge was that the sums demanded were\n\"unreasonable and not payable in full\".\n6. On 24 June 2025, the Applicant filed a Reply (p.45-49) and on 21 July, a\nSupplementary Statement in Reply (p.50-60). By 21 July 2025, the\nparties had been directed to serve any witness statements. The Applicant\nserved witness statements from Suganthiny Jeyanesan, Revenue Service\nCharge Accountant (p.111-117) and David Prudence, Estate Cleaning\n2\n\nSupervisor (p.118-119). The Respondent did not file any witness\nstatements.\nThe Hearing\n7. The Applicant was represented by Mr Gareth Chew, a Litigation Officer.\nWe heard evidence from Ms Jeyanesan. Mr Prudence was unable to\nattend as he was ill. The Tribunal has had regard to his witness\nstatement. We indicated that the weight that we would give to his\nevidence, might be affected by the fact that he was unable to attend.\nHowever, his evidence was not challenged by the Respondent.\n8. Ms Lazarus, the Respondent, appeared in person. She was accompanied\nby Ms Comfort Okwechime (her daughter) and Ms Felicia Ebegbue (an\naunt). Ms Lazurus gave evidence. Ms Lazarus is a midwife. She is\ncurrently unable to work due to ill health, namely stress. She has three\nchildren, not all of whom are currently living with her.\n9. Ms Lazarus is clearly overwhelmed by the financial problems that she\nfaces. On 13 June 2005, she acquired her lease in the flat pursuant to the\nRight to Buy legislation. She has separated from her partner and on 29\nOctober 2021, the lease was transferred into her sole name. She has been\nunable to pay the service charges that have been demanded and is now\nin substantial debt. Since 2020, she has been trying to sell her flat. She\nrecently put it up at auction, but no offers were made. She described how\nshe is trapped in a home that she is unable to afford. She felt \"victimised\"\nby the Applicant. She was visibly distressed during the hearing. We\ngranted short adjournments and permitted her daughter to sit next to\nher.\n10. Whilst Ms Lazarus made a number of complaints about the quality of the\nservices that have been provided, the quality of her evidence relating to\nthis was poor. She has not pleaded her case with any precision. She has\nnot provided a witness statement.\n11. Ms Lazarus complained that she had made payments to her service\ncharge account which had not been credited to her account. At the\nhearing, Mr Chew provided a statement of her account. Ms Lazarus was\nnot able to identify any payment that had not been credited to her\naccount. The confusion seems to have arisen from the manner in which\nthe Applicant has apportioned the sums that she has paid against the\nvarious invoices which have been outstanding.\n12. The Applicant's claim relates to two service charge demands:\n(i) The final service charge demand for 2022/23 in the sum of £5,755.44\n(p.68). The interim service charge had been £3,629.70 (p.64). The\nsubstantial increase in the final demand is explained by the charge for\n3\n\nheating and hot water which had increased from £1,816.49 to £3,681.07.\nThis reflected the large increase in the price of energy during this period.\n(ii) The interim service charge for 2023/24 in the sum of £5,898.77\n(p.106). At the hearing, Mr Chew provided the final demand for the year\nin the sum of £6,039.72. This is the charge which the Applicant had\nchallenged in her Statement of Case. The actual expenditure on heating\nand hot water was £2,792.73, compared with an estimate of £3,552.24,\nreflecting the fall in energy process. However, the final expenditure on\nblock responsive repairs was £801.72, compared with a budget of\n£267.76.\n13. Both demands included modest sums for ground rent of £10. These\ndemands would be outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. However, Mr\nChew accepted that these sums had been settled from the payments\nwhich the Respondent had made\n14. Mr Chew noted that the Applicant had sent a number of \"letters of claim\"\nbefore issuing proceedings. Ms Lazarus had not responded to these.\n15. Ms Lazurus raised a number of complaints during the hearing. Mr Chew\nstated that these had not previously been raised with the Applicant. He\nagreed to respond to these. The complaints were (i) condensation to the\nflat; (ii) a rat infestation; and (iii) a hole in the wall between her flat and\nFlat 28. She had also wanted to make a claim under the Applicant's\ninsurance policy. Mr Chew agreed to provide her with details of how to\nmake a claim.\nThe Lease\n16. The Respondent's lease is dated 13 June 2005 (at p.6-29). This is a two\nbedroom flat on the first floor of a three storey brick and tile building\nwhich was constructed in the 1990s. The lease is for a term of 125 years.\n17. The Applicant covenants to provide the following services for \"the\nBuilding\" and \"the Estate\": (i) central heating; (ii) hot water supply; (iii)\ncaretaking lighting and cleaning of common areas; (iv) maintenance of\ncommon television aerial or landline; (v) maintenance of Estate roads\nand paths; (vi) Estate lighting; (vii) maintenance of gardens or\nlandscaped areas; and (viii) unitemised repairs\".\n18. The \"Building\" is defined as \"the building known as 22-32 (EV) Clifton\nWay, Brimmington Estate, London SE15 including any grounds\noutbuildings gardens and yards or other property appertaining\nexclusively thereto\". The \"Estate” is defined as \"the Brimmington Estate,\nLondon SE15 including all roads paths gardens and other property\nforming part thereof\".\n4\n\n19. By paragraph 6(2) of the Third Schedule, the Applicant may adopt \"any\nreasonable method\" of ascertaining the Respondent's proportion of\nservice charges and may adopt different methods in relation to different\nitems of costs and expenses. Ms Jeyanesan described how the Applicant\napportion costs to individual properties, using a \"Bed-Weighting\nMethod\". Under this method, all dwellings are given a base unit of 4,\ncomprising of bathroom, kitchen, living room and hallway. An additional\n1 is added for every bedroom within the dwelling.\n20. The Respondent charges the Respondent 6/36 of the Building costs and\n6/2776 of the Estate costs. There are six two bedroom flats in the\nBuilding.\n21. In her witness statement, Ms Jeyanesan wrongly stated that the\nRespondent's flat had three bedrooms. We are satisfied that this was a\nmistake and that the Applicant has correctly assessed her as the flat\nhaving two bedrooms. This is confirmed by the document at p.79. Ms\nLazarus was not willing to accept that this was a mistake.\n22. By paragraph 7(7) of the Third Schedule, the Applicant is permitted to\nemploy managing agents. Where no managing agents are employed, the\nApplicant is permitted to add an administration charge of 10% to the\nservice charge expenditure.\nThe Service Charges for 2022/23\n23. On 14 February 2022 (at p.61-64), the Applicant issued a demand for an\ninterim service charge of £3,629.70. The budget on which it was based is\nat p.64. The Respondent was given the options of paying quarterly or\nmonthly. On 22 September 2023 (p.65-70), the Applicant issued a\ndemand for a balancing charge of £2,125.74. The Respondent has paid\n£1,914.86 towards the interim charge. A compensation payment of £50\nwas also credited to her account. The Respondent has made no payment\ntowards the final demand. The Applicant asserts that £3,790.58 is\noutstanding. This is £150 less than the sum pleaded in the Particulars of\nClaim, as these sums were paid/credited after the claim was issued.\n24. The breakdown of the final expenditure is at p.68. A summary of all the\ninvoices upon which this is based is at p.70-103. In her witness statement\n(at p.111-117), Ms Jeyanesan explains how the service charge expenditure\nhas been computed. Ms Lazarus complains that no services or\nmaintenance was provided. This is contradicted by the breakdown of the\ninvoices which the Applicant has provided.\n25. In her Scott Schedule (p.44), the Respondent asserts that sums\ndemanded are unreasonable and not payable in full. She does not\nchallenge any specific budget item. In her letter (p.39), she complains\nthat she should not be liable for an estate charge. However, express\n5\n\nprovision is made for it in her lease. Whilst her particular \"Building\"\nconsists of six flats, this is part of a wider estate.\n26. The substantial increase in the final demand is explained by the charge\nfor heating and hot water which had increased from £1,816.49 to\n£3,681.07. This reflected the large increase in the price of energy during\nthis period. Because the energy is provided by a district heating system,\nMs Lazarus did not benefit from any government assistance.\n27. On 19 February 2025, a compensation payment of £50 was credited to\nthe Respondent's account. Ms Lazarus had complained that her flat was\noverheating. It is apparent that a pipe had corroded and steam was\ncoming out of a riser. Ms Lazarus utilised the Applicant's complaints\nprocedure (see p.180-194). It seems that Ms Lazarus first complained of\nthe problem in August 2022. It was resolved in September. The Tribunal\nis satisfied that an appropriate payment of compensation was made.\n28. In her evidence, Ms Lazarus complained that she had had no heating for\nhalf of then year and no hot water for three months. She said that she\nhad been provided with five electric heaters. However, she was unable to\nrefer us to any written complaints relating to this. She has failed to satisfy\nus that any reduction should be made on this ground.\n29. Ms Lazarus also complained about the arrangements for the removal of\nrubbish. She complained that no bins had been provided. However, it\nwas apparent that whilst bins were provided for the neighbouring town\nhouses, separate arrangements were made for the six flats in the\nApplicant's building.\n30. We are satisfied that the sums demanded are reasonable and payable.\nWe readily accept that Ms Lazarus considered that the increased demand\nfor heating and hot water was excessive. However, this reflected the\nincrease in energy process at the time.\nThe Service Charges for 2023/24\n31. On 14 February 2023 (at p.104-110) the Applicant issued a demand for\nan interim service charge of £5,898.77. The budget on which it was based\nis at p.106. The Respondent was again given the options of paying\nquarterly or monthly. The Applicant accepts that the Respondent made\ntwo payments totalling £2,842.07. On 18 May 2023, a credit of £107.31\nwas made to the account. The Applicant claims a sum of £2,949.39 (see\np.32).\n32. This is a demand for an interim service charge. Strictly, the Tribunal is\nonly concerned with the reasonableness of the sums included in the\nbudget. At this stage, there could be no challenge to the quality of the\nservice. At the hearing, Mr Chew provided the final demand for the year\n6\n\nin the sum of £6,039.72. This is the charge which the Applicant had\nchallenged in her Statement of Case. The actual expenditure on heating\nand hot water was £2,792.73, compared with an estimate of £3,552.24,\nreflecting the fall in energy prices. However, the final expenditure on\nblock responsive repairs was £801.72, compared with a budget of\n£267.76. Because the Tribunal is only concerned with the interim service\ncharge demand, we have not been provided with a summary of the\ninvoices for the year. However, the provision of the final account\nconfirms our view that the sums included in the budget were reasonable.\n33. On 18 May 2023, the Applicant credited a sum of £107.31 to the\nRespondent's service charge account. On 17 May 2023 (p.205), the\nApplicant wrote to Respondent to explain that they were reducing the\nadministration charge by £107.31 because of high increase in the fuel\nprices. The administration charge is computed as 10% of the total service\ncharges.\n34. In her Scott Schedule (p.44), the Respondent again asserts that the sum\ndemanded is unreasonable and not payable in full. She does not\nchallenge any specific budget item. The Respondent has not satisfied us\nthat any item in the budget is unreasonable or is not payable pursuant to\nthe terms of her lease.\nCosts\n35. Mr Chew informed the Tribunal that the Applicant would not be seeking\nto recover its costs in respect of the tribunal proceedings against the\nRespondent.\nThe Next Steps\n36.

The single issue before the tribunal was whether the applicant was, on\nthe relevant date, entitled to acquire the right to manage the subject\npremises\n2. The decision of the tribunal is that the applicant was, on the relevant\ndate, entitled to acquire the right to manage the subject premises.\nAccordingly, the acquisition date of the right to manage is the date\nspecified in accordance with the provisions of s90 of the Act.\n3. The reasons for this decision are set out below.\nProcedural background\n4. The premises comprise two self-contained flats both of which have\nbeen sold off on long leases. The respondent is the landlord. The two\nlessees promoted the formation of the applicant company with a view\nto acquiring the right to manage conferred in Part 2, Chapter 1 of the\nAct.\n5. By claim notice dated 16 October 2018 given pursuant to s79 of the Act\nthe applicant sought to acquire the right to manage on 5 March 2019.\n6. By a counter-notice dated 22 November 2018 given pursuant to s84 of\nthe Act the respondent alleged that by reason of s80(8) and (9) the\napplicant was not entitled to acquire the right to manage the specified\npremises. Rather unhelpfully the counter-notice was in generic form\nand did not provide to any details explaining clearly (or at all) the\nreasons why it was alleged the requirements of s80(8) and (9) had not\nbeen met.\n7. On 17 January 2019 the tribunal received an application from the\napplicant pursuant to s80(3) of the Act. Directions were given on 24\nJanuary 2019. The parties were notified of the intention of the tribunal\nto determine the application on the papers to be provided by the parties\nand without an oral hearing, unless either party requested an oral\nhearing. The tribunal has not received any such request.\n8. The tribunal had before it:\n8.1 The application form – to stand as the applicant’s opening\nstatement of case;\n8.2 The respondent’s statement of case in answer; and\n8.3 The applicant’s statement of case in reply.\nThe points in issue\n9. In its statement of case in answer, the respondent has raised two very\ntechnical points arising from the procedure concerning the acquisition\n2\n\nof the right to manage as set out in the Act and regulations made\nthereunder.\n9.1 The first in that claim notice was not in the current prescribed\nform; and\n9.2 A new point, not mentioned in the counter-notice concerning the\naddress of the lessee of 102B Landor Road given in The\nSchedule. Part 1 of the claim notice.\nClaim notice - the prescribed form\n10. S80(9) of the Act provides that a claim notice must comply with such\nrequirements (if any) about the form of the claim notices as may be\nprescribed by regulations so made.\n11. The current regulations are the Right to Manage (Prescribed\nParticulars and Forms) (England) Regulations SI 2010/825.\nSchedule 2 to those regulations sets out the prescribed form of a claim\nnotice. Provision is made for four notes to appear at the end of the\nnotice.\nNote 1 provided that where a claim notice was to be given to a person\nwho could not be found, the RTM company may apply to the “leasehold\nvaluation tribunal for an order …”\n12. By the Transfer of Tribunal Functions Order 2013 SI 1036 the wording\nof note 1 was amended to delete the words “leasehold valuation” and to\nsubstitute the words “a first-tier”.\n13. The respondent does not in terms submit that the claim notice dated 16\nOctober 2018 is not a valid notice but asserts a claim notice “should\nreflect this change…”.\n14. The applicant does not deny that an outdated form was used. The\napplicant denies that the claim notice given was not a valid notice.\n15. The applicant relies upon the provisions of s81(1) of the Act which\nprovides that a claim notice is not invalidated by any inaccuracy in any\nof the particulars required by or by virtue of s80.\n16. The applicant also relies upon Assethold Limited v 14 Stansfield Road\nRTM Company Ltd [2012] UKUT 262 (LC) in which the President\ndiscussed the technical issues raised and considered a number of\nauthorities concerning the use of an out of date prescribed form in the\ncontext of the 2010 regulations. In that case the President held that\nthere was no material difference in the substance of forms used and the\nnature of the error and the appeal on that ground failed.\nWe infer that the respondent is well aware of this authority and this\nraises the question why such an unmeritorious point such as this was\nraised at all.\n3\n\n17. We prefer and adopt the submissions of the applicant on this point and\ndetermine that claim notice was not invalidated by the use of the (only\nvery slightly) incorrect form. In any event, in case it be relevant, the\nnote in question was a note for the benefit of the RTM Company and\nthis was not a case where the person on whom the claim notice was to\nbe served could not found.\nAddress for service\n18. The point taken was very oblique and it was not a point raised in the\ncounter-notice.\n19. Part 1 of the Schedule to the claim notice is required to set out the full\nnames of the qualifying tenant of a flat and the address of that flat.\nThe subject claim notice states:\n“(1) Kevin Hughes and Katherine Mary Adelaide Hughes (joint\ntenants) – Flat 102B Landor Road, London SW9 9NX\nBoth of Flat 11 Park House, Shore Road, London E9 7TB”\nThat of itself does not appear to specify or concern an address for\nservice. At most it may be nothing more than a statement of fact.\n20. The respondent has raised s111(5) of the Act which provides:\n“A … RTM company … may give a notice under this Chapter to a …\nqualifying tenant of a flat … at the flat unless it has been notified by\nthe qualifying tenant of a different address … at which he wishes to be\ngiven any such notice.”\nThe respondent does not appear to have evidence that the claim notice\nwas not given to the tenant of flat 102B Landor Road or that the tenant\nof that flat has complained about a failure to give the notice to a correct\naddress. It is therefore puzzling why the respondent should trouble to\nraise this point at such a late stage, or what objective the respondent\nseeks to achieve in doing so.\nIn paragraph 7 of its statement of case the respondent simply says it:\n“… seeks clarification on this issue to ensure valid service of the claim\nnotice …”.\n21. The applicant, in its statement of case in reply, exhibits a copy of the\nclaim notice given to the tenant of flat 102B. It was addressed to Flat 11,\nPark House.\n22. There is no evidence before us from which we can conclude that the\nnotice was not properly given to the tenant of flat 102B.\n4\n\nConclusion\n23. The two points taken by the respondent are without merit. For the\nreasons set out above we determine that on the relevant date the\napplicant was entitled to acquire the right to manage the specified\npremises.\nJudge John Hewitt\n19 March 2019\nANNEX - RIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) then a written application for permission must be made to\nthe First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing\nwith the case.\n2. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the Regional\noffice within 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the\ndecision to the person making the application.\n3. If the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\nfor permission to appeal to proceed despite not being within the time\nlimit.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the\ncase number), state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\n5"

The Respondent were directed to provide\na Hearing Bundle. References to this bundle (1,275 pages) will the prefixed by\n\"HB.__\". The Applicants have produced an additional bundle which extends\nto 950 pages. Reference to this will be prefixed by \"A.__\"). This includes a\nnumber of photographs. The Applicants have also provided a number of\nvideos. and videos.\n2\n\nIntroduction\n1. The Tribunal is required to determine six applications brought by seven tenants\nwho hold leases at four blocks at Warren Close, Hayes, UB4 0XY who seek a\ndetermination of the payability and reasonableness of the service charges\npursuant to section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (\"the Act\"). The\napplication relates to the sums charged for cyclical works (Issue 1); the service\ncharges for 2023/24 (Issue 2) and the interim service charges payable for\n2024/25 (Issue 3). The service charge accounts for 2024/25 are not yet\navailable.\n2. Warren Close is a development of 24 residential one bedroom flats across five\nblocks. Pentagon House and Welles House have six flats on three floors. Meade\nHouse and Kingfisher House have 4 flats on two floors. The fifth block, with\nwhich the Tribunal is not concerned, is Sovereign House which has four flats.\nAll the tenants pay a service charge of 4.167%.\n3. The development was completed in 1994. The flats originally had wooden sash\nwindows. Northcote Housing Association Limited granted shared ownership\nleases to the tenants. There have been a number of changes in the identity of\nthe landlord. On some unspecified date, Catalyst Housing Ltd (\"Catalyst\")\nacquired the freehold interest. On 1 April 2022, Catalyst became a subsidiary of\nthe Respondent. Four of the tenants have \"staircased up\" and now own 100% of\nthe beneficial interest in their flats. Mr Hoareau is one of these tenants.\n4. The following are parties to this application:\n(i) Mr Nazim Shah (Flat 1 Pentagon House). He acquired his lease in September\n2013.\n(ii) Mr Laurence Hoareau (Flat 2 Pentagon House).\n(iii) Mr Peter Latawiec (Flat 3 Pentagon House).\n(iv) Mr Tiamour Osman (Flat 6 Pentagon House). He acquired the lease in\nOctober 2003. He is a sales engineer. He occupies his flat on his own.\n(v) Mr Carl Jackson (Flat 3 Meade House). He is a special needs teacher. He\noccupies his one bedroom flat with his wife and two children. He acquired his\nflat in August 2014.\n(vi) Mr Gavin Frederick (Flat 4 Kingfisher House).\n(vii) Mr Jeyasingham Puvendran (Flat 5 Welles House). He acquired his lease\nin July 2007. He is a sales engineer. He occupies his flat on his own.\n5. The parties have provided a Scott Schedule (HB.92-114). This raises a total of\n46 service charge items which are challenged. Ms Traynor comments that this\n3\n\nis a \"wholly unhelpful document\" in trying to identify the substance of the\nApplicants' complaints. She has provided a summary of the items challenged\nfor the service charge year 2023/24 and the interim service charge for 2024/25.\nHowever, there are 31 challenges to cyclical works which were carried out\nbetween July and October 2022. Confusion has arisen because the Respondent\ninitially apportioned the costs attributable to the five individual blocks. The\nRespondent then recognised that this was not in accordance with the terms of\nthe leases. The charges were then reissued apportioning the cost of the works\nequally between the 24 flats. However, because of the delays that had occurred,\nthe Respondent recognised that no tenant could be required to pay more; rather\na refund was made to those tenants who had been overcharged.\n6. The three lead tenants, Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau and Mr Jackson, have jointly\nmade a witness statement (at HB.337-344). Mr Hoareau has taken the initiative\npreparing the case for the Applicants. Unfortunately, due to the untimely death\nof his wife, Mr Hoareau was unable to attend the hearing. Her funeral was held\non the first day of the hearing. The tenants were anxious for their application to\nproceed in his absence. Mr Shah, Mr Jackson and Mr Puendran attended the\nhearing and gave evidence on behalf of the Applicants. Mr Osman attended on\nthe second day of the hearing. Mr Shah provided a Skeleton Argument.\n7. Mr Shah complained that it was wrong that tenants who only had a 30% share\nin the equity of their flat, should be required to pay 100% of the service charge.\nThe Tribunal explained that this was the contractual position as provided in the\nlease. Further, it was the standard model for shared ownership leases in\nEngland. If this is considered to be unfair, this is a matter for the Regulator of\nSocial Housing and/or parliament. It is not a matter for this Tribunal.\n8. Ms Katherine Traynor (Counsel) appeared on behalf of the Respondent. She\nwas accompanied by both Ms Mary Walsh and Mr Jordan Corrall from her\ninstructing solicitor, Winkworth Sherwood. She adduced evidence from Ms\nSandraline Kamba, the Respondent's Service Charge Specialist (statement at\nHB.293-303); Ms Samantha Dhanilall, the Respondent's Regional Home\nOwnership Manager for North West London (statement at HB.304-311) and Ms\nSatinder Bedi, the Respondent's Project Manager (statements at HB.688-690\nand HB.312-316). Ms Traynor provided a Skeleton Argument and a Bundle of\n15 authorities.\n9. The Applicants have come together because they are concerned about the level\nof the service charges that they have been required to pay. This has been\ninstigated by the cost of a programme of cyclical repairs. They also complain of\nthe quality of the works. Their attack is unfocussed. Their witness statement\nextends to just 8 pages. Their witness statement does not address the numerous\nphotographs in their bundle of 1,275 pages and the videos which they have\nprovided.\n10. The Applicants are litigants in person. However, they must recognise that they\nmust identify the issues that they require the tribunal to determine and prove\ntheir case as to why the service charges are not payable or are unreasonable.\n4\n\n11. Ms Traynor states that the Respondent's approach has at all times been to\nengage constructively by responding to the Applicants’ queries, providing\ndocumentation, and addressing, within these proceedings, as many of the\npoints made as can practically be achieved. The Respondent approached the\nhearing in the same vein in the hope of a more constructive relationship moving\nforward.\nThe Leases\n12. The Tribunal has been provided with the leases for Flats 1 and Flats 6 Pentagon\nHouse; Flat 3 Meade House; and Flat 4 Kingfisher House. Although the\nTribunal has stated that all tenants are required to pay a service charge of\n4.167%, this is not strictly correct. The lease for Flat 6 Pentagon House specifies\na percentage of 0.04167% and that for 4 Kingfisher House a percentage of\n0.4167%. The parties accepted that these are manifest errors and 4.167% is the\ncorrect percentage for all leases.\n13. The \"Buildings\" are defined as including the five blocks. Thus the 4.167% service\ncharge extends to the costs of repairing, decorating and repairing any of the five\nblocks.\n14. By Clause 3 (2)(c), the Leaseholder covenants to pay the Service Charge in\naccordance with Clause 7. Clause 7 (2) contains a covenant on the part of the\nLeaseholder to pay the Service Charge during the Term by monthly equal\npayments in advance on the first day of each month. The \"Service Charge\" is\ndefined in Clause 7 (1)(d) as the \"Specified Proportion of the Service Provision\".\nThe \"Specified Proportion\" is defined as ‘the proportion specified in the\nParticulars”, namely 4.167%.\n15. Clause 5 sets out the Landlord's covenants. Clause 5(2) is a covenant to insure\nthe Buildings. By Clause 5 (3), the Landlord covenants to maintain, repair and\ndecorate the roof, foundations, main structure of the Buildings, and all external\nparts including the windows and doors (but excluding the glass).\n16. The \"Service Provision\" (by Clause 7 (4)) is calculated by an estimate of the\nexpenditure likely to be incurred in a relevant year together with an amount\ntowards a reserve. Clause 7 (5) provides as follows; \"The relevant expenditure\nto be included in the Service Provision shall comprise all expenditure\nreasonably incurred by the Landlord in connection with the repair,\nmanagement, maintenance and provision of services for the Building…\" and\nincludes specifically the cost of the Landlord’s performance of covenants\ncontained in Clauses 5 (2), 5 (3) and 5 (4). As soon as practicable after the end\nof each Account Year the Landlord determines whether the estimate has\nexceeded or fallen short of the actual expenditure in the Account year (clause 7\n(6)).\nThe Law\n5\n\n17. Section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the Act”) defines the concepts\nof “service charge” and “relevant costs”:\n“(1) In the following provisions of this Act “service charge” means an\namount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to the\nrent—\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements or insurance or the landlord’s costs\nof management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to the\nrelevant costs.”\n(2) The relevant costs are the costs or estimate costs incurred or to be\nincurred by or on behalf of the landlord, or a superior landlord, in\nconnection with matters for which the service charge is payable.”\n18. Section 19 gives this Tribunal the jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness\nof any service charge:\n“(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the\namount of a service charge payable for a period—\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the\ncarrying out of works, only if the services or works are of a\nreasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.”\n19. The Supreme Court has recently reviewed the approach that should be adopted\nby tribunals in considering the reasonableness of service charges in Williams v\nAviva Investors Ground Rent GP Ltd [2023] UKSC 6; [2023] 2 WLR 484. Lord\nBriggs JSC (at [14]) recognised that the making of a demand for payment of a\nservice charge will have required the landlord (or manager in this case) first to\nhave made a number of discretionary management decisions. These will include\nwhat works to carry out or services to perform, with whom to contract for their\nprovision and at what price, and how to apportion the aggregate costs among\nthe tenants benefited by the works or services. To some extent the answers to\nthose questions may be prescribed in the lease, for example by way of a\ncovenant by the landlord to provide a list of specified services, or by a fixed\napportionment regime. But even the most rigid and detailed contractual regime\nis likely to leave important decisions to the discretion of the landlord. A landlord\nis contractually obliged to act reasonably. This is subject to this Tribunal’s\n6\n\njurisdiction under the 1985 Act to determine whether the landlord acted\nreasonably (see [33]).\n20. The Tribunal highlights the following passage from the judgment of Martin\nRodger KC, the Deputy President, in Enterprise Home Developments LLP v\nAdam [2020] UKUT 151 (LC) at [28]: \"Much has changed since the Court of\nAppeal’s decision in Yorkbrook v Batten but one important principle remains\napplicable, namely that it is for the party disputing the reasonableness of sums\nclaimed to establish a prima facie case.\"\n21. Section 20 of the Act requires a landlord to consult in respect of and “qualifying\nworks” where the relevant contribution of any tenant will exceed £250. The\nconsultation requirements applicable in the present case are contained in Part\n2 of Schedule 4 to the Service Charge (Consultation Requirements) (England)\nRegulations 2003. A summary of these is set out in the speech of Lord\nNeuberger in Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson [2013] UKSC 14; [2013] 1 WLR\n854 at [12]:\nStage 1: Notice of Intention to do the Works: Notice must be given to each\ntenant and any tenants’ association, describing the works, or saying\nwhere and when a description may be inspected, stating the reasons for\nthe works, specifying where and when observations and nominations for\npossible contractors should be sent, allowing at least 30 days. The\nlandlord must have regard to those observations.\nStage 2: Estimates: The landlord must seek estimates for the works,\nincluding from any nominee identified by any tenants or the association.\nStage 3: Notice about Estimates: The landlord must issue a statement to\ntenants and the association, with two or more estimates, a summary of\nthe observations, and its responses. Any nominee’s estimate must be\nincluded. The statement must say where and when estimates may be\ninspected, and where and by when observations can be sent, allowing at\nleast 30 days. The landlord must have regard to such observations.\n4: Notification of reasons: Unless the chosen contractor is a nominee or\nsubmitted the lowest estimate, the landlord must, within 21 days of\ncontracting, give a statement to each tenant and the association of its\nreasons, or specifying where and when such a statement may be\ninspected.\nThe Background\n22. In 2019, the development was being managed by Catalyst. The time had come\nfor a programme of external repairs and decorations (\"cyclical repairs\"). The\nlandlord arranged for the development to be inspected by Michael Doherty from\nig9 LLP (\"ig9\"). His inspection report, dated 11 January 2019, is at HB.691-722.\nHe noted that the windows were timber framed double glazed sash units. They\n7\n\nwere in a poor condition with chipped and flaking decoration. Numerous\nglazing units had failed. There were isolated areas of wet rot. He recommended\nthat the windows be replaced with new UPVC double glazed units.\n23. On 5 April 2019, Catalyst served a Stage 1 \"Notice of Intention\" on the tenants\n(at HB.595-596). The tenants were notified of the proposal to replace the\nwindows with double glazed UPVC units. Catalyst balloted the tenants on the\npreferred colour on the inside of the new windows. The external face was to be\nbrown as existing. Eleven of the 24 tenants responded to the ballot. On 12\nDecember 2019, Catalyst served a \"Notice of Estimates\". However, this was\nlater withdrawn. Apparently, the tenants were told that the cost of the works\nwould be some £105k (exc VAT).\n24. On 24 February 2020, Catalyst held a meeting with the tenants to discuss a\nnumber of concerns that had been raised. Ms Bedi attended the meeting. The\nminutes of the meeting are at HB.725-727. Tenants were concerned about the\ncost of the works and the payment plan that was being offered. Tenants queried\nwhether it would be possible to install casement, rather than sash, windows.\nThe cost would be lower. Catalyst responded that planning consent had been\nsought for a \"like-for-like\" replacement of sash windows.\n25. On 23 March 2020, the first lockdown was imposed and the works were put on\nhold. On 18 March 2021, Catalyst held a further meeting with tenants by zoom.\nThe minutes are at HB.728-730. Some tenants against repeated their\npreference for casement windows. They again complained about the cost of the\nworks. Catalyst responded that this should have been raised in response to the\nNotice of Intention. The Respondent had proceeded on the basis of like-for-like\ncasement windows. The tenants queried why the works had not been included\nin the annual budget and why they could not be funded from reserves. It was\nagreed to omit the door entry replacement to save money.\n26. In April 2021, there was a second ballot as to whether the windows should be\nstandard top hung UPVC casement windows or UPVC sash windows. On 6 April\n(HB.1239), Ms Bedi wrote to Mr Shah with estimates of the relative cost of\ninstalling top hung casement windows (£124,137) and sash windows (£153,117).\nThe ballot closed on 14 April. Twelve tenants voted, six for each option.\n27. In June 2021, ig9 prepared a specification of works (at HB.786-791). This\nprovided for sash windows. On 23 June 2021, ig9 invited three contractors to\nquote for the replacement of the windows. Three tenders were returned\n(at.HB.755-7). Ig9 prepared a tender report and recommended that the\nPrincipal Contractor appoint Symphony, who had provided the lowest quote.\n28. In August 2021, ig9 prepared a further tender report for the other cyclical works\n(HB.758-774). Five tenders were invited and four were returned (at HB.775-\n778). Ig9 recommended that Probuild (London) Limited (PBL) who had\nprovided the lowest quote be appointed as the Principal Contractor.\n8\n\n29. On 27 August 2021 (at HB.597-601), Catalyst sent out the Notice of Estimates.\nCatalyst informed the tenants that they had decided to proceed with sash\nwindows. The outcome of the ballot had been a draw. Catalyst had therefore\ndecided to proceed under the existing planning application to install \"like-for-\nlike\" sash windows. Details of the estimates were provided. Catalyst proposed\nto appoint PBL as the Principal Contractor who had quoted £135,549 (exc VAT)\nand Symphony Windows, who had quoted £144,648 to replace the windows. To\nthis would be added VAT of 20% and professional fees of £15,000. For the six\ntenants at Pentagon House, the cost of the works would be £93,370, less a\nreserve fund contribution of £14,688. The estimated cost per tenant was\n£13,113.79.The Respondent offered a 12 month payment agreement.\n30. On 23 September 2021 (at HB.602), Mr Puvendran responded to the\nconsultation. He inquired why the costs had gone up by 50%.\n31. On 28 February 2022, Catalyst held a further meeting with tenants. The\nminutes are at HB.778-785. Fifteen tenants attended. John McDonnell MP also\nattended. The tenants queried the cost of the works. It was again suggested that\ncasement windows would have been cheaper. A tenant suggested that the\nreplacement of the windows was only required because of historic neglect.\nTenants asked how they could afford the works. Catalyst offered a repayment\nplan dependent upon the financial circumstances of the individual tenants. Mr\nHoareau states that he asked the meeting to confirm whether they preferred\ncasement windows to the sash windows that were proposed. 14 voted for\ncasement windows (58% of the total of 24 leaseholders). This vote did not\nappear in the minutes.\n32. On 1 April 2022, Catalyst became a subsidiary of Peabody. On 23 June (HB.952-\n955), Ms Bedi wrote to the tenants about the proposed works. She was the\nProject Manager. She has provided a detailed witness statement and gave\nevidence. The works started on 18 July and were completed on 21 October 2022.\nThe communal windows were installed in the week commencing 28 November\n2022. There is a substantial dispute between the parties as to the quality of the\nworks, which the Tribunal needs to determine.\n33. Ms Bedi sates that the programme of works consisted of the following: erect\nscaffolding; R & D survey; clean roofs; rainwater goods overhaul; Clean soffits\nand fascia; replace windows and doors; mastic, masonry works and cleaning;\nexternal decorations; and strike scaffolding.\n34. The final cost of the cyclical repairs was £364,777.43, namely (i) cost of works:\n£264,331.47; (ii) VAT: £52,866.29; + (iii) Professional fees (15%): £47,579.66.\n£131,000 was funded from the reserve fund. Thus the cost to be charged to\ntenants was £233,777.43. This should have been charged equally to the 24 flats,\nnamely £9,740.73 per tenant.\n35. On 29 January 2024, Peabody issued the initial demands for the works (at\nHB.634-672). The cost of the works were incorrectly apportioned based on an\nequal apportionment of the works carried out to the individual blocks. This was\n9\n\nincorrect. The leases define \"the buildings\" as the five blocks. The cost should\ntherefore have been apportioned equally between the 24 tenants. On 15 March\n2024 (at p.650-660), Peabody issued revised demands. This resulted in some\ntenants receiving a refund. However, the Respondent recognised that it was\nnow too late to issue a supplementary demand to those who had been charged\ntoo little.\nInitial Adjusted Benefit\nTenant Demand Demand\nNazim Shah (1 Pentagon House) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nLaurence Hoareau (2 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nPeter Latawiec (3 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nTiamour Osman (6 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nCarl Jackson (3 Meade House) £10,484.98 £9,740.73\nGavin Frederick (4 Kingfisher) £9,907.10 £9,740.73\nJeyasingham Puvendran £9,513.91 - £226.82\n(5 Welles House)\n36. On 28 April 2024, Mr Shah issued his application to this Tribunal. His main\ncomplaint was the sum that he had been charged for these cyclical works.\nHowever, he also challenges a number of service charges for 2023/24 and the\ninterim service charge for 20224/25. Over the subsequent weeks, tenants\nissued five further application.\nIssue 1: The Cyclical Works\n37. The Applicants raised a number of wide ranging arguments as to why they are\nnot obliged to contribute to the cost of the major works. We can deal with many\nof these briefly:\n(i) The Applicants suggest that the need for the works arises through \"historic\nneglect\". We are satisfied that for such a claim to succeed, the Applicants would\nneed to establish a counterclaim or set-off (see Continental Property Ventures\nInc v White [2007] L.& T.R.4). In particular, any tenant would need to establish\nthat he had a good claim for disrepair during the time that they were the lessee.\nNo tenant has established this. The ig9 Inspection Report, dated 11 January\n2019, does not suggest any widespread disrepair. It is consistent with what one\nwould expect from wooden windows which after 25 years were nearing the end\nof their natural lives.\n(ii) The Applicants rely on Clause 3 (19) of their leases to argue that they are\nonly liable for the cost of any repairs, insofar as the tenant caused or contributed\nto the disrepair by any act, neglect or default. This is to fail to understand the\nterms of the lease. If any individual tenant has caused any disrepair, he has a\npersonal responsibility to make good that damage. However, the landlord is\nrequired to repair, maintain and decorate the Buildings, and this is a service\ncharge expenditure for which all the tenants are liable.\n10\n\n(iii) The landlord failed to comply with the statutory consultation procedures.\nOn 5 April 2019, the Respondent served the Stage 1 \"Notice of Intention\". At\nthis stage, the tenants did not suggest casement windows. Neither did they\nsuggest a contractor from whom an estimate should be sought. On 27 August\n2021, the Respondent served the Stage 3 \"Notice of Estimates\". The Respondent\nhad tested the market and obtained four tenders for the work as \"Principal\nContractor\" and the for the replacement of the windows. The Respondent\nselected the lowest estimates.\n(iv) The Applicants complain of the overall cost of the works. There was an\nunfortunate delay in 2020 which was inevitable because of the Covid-19 lock\ndown. However, there was no need for the Respondent to serve a further \"Notice\nof Intention\". When the Covid-19 lockdown was lifted, there was a significant\nincrease in building costs. The Applicants were a victim of this.\n(v) The Applicants contend that the supervision fee of 15% was unreasonable.\nWe disagree. It is a standard charge for works of this type. However, we have\nfound that the supervision of this contract was inadequate (see below). We\ntherefore reduce The professional fees of £47,579.66 by £1,000 to reflect this.\n38. A particular concern raised by the Applicants, is the Respondent's decision to\ninstall sash, rather than casement, windows. All agreed that UPVC windows\nshould replace the existing wooden sash windows. It is common ground that\ncasement windows would have been cheaper (on 6 April 2021, Ms Bedi had\nsuggested that the cost would have been £124,137, as against £153,117). Mr\nJackson suggested that the cost would have been much cheaper and obtained a\nquote from Safe Style (at HB1,242) of £3,000 to install casement windows in\nhis flat. He also obtained a quote (at HB.1243) of £350 + VAT for use of a cherry\npicker for 7 days. The cost of scaffolding for some 15 weeks was £30,370.\n39. The Tribunal does not accept that it would have been appropriate to use a cherry\npicker for a job of this size. We do accept that the installation of the casement\nwould have been somewhat cheaper, say some £30k. However, we accept that\nthe Respondent was entitled to select sash, rather than casement, windows. Ms\nBedi stated that it was the Respondent's policy to replace windows on a like-for-\nlike basis for possible. The tenants had only raised the issue at a late stage in the\nconsultation process.\n40. Whilst a landlord must consult its tenants, it has the ultimate discretion as to\nwhat windows should be installed (see [19] above). The landlord was required\nto have due regard to views expressed by the tenants; it was not bound to accept\nthe majority view of the tenants. Catalyst's starting point was to go for sash\nwindows on a \"like-for-like\" basis. All agreed that UPVC was a more cost\neffective option that wood. It was only at a later stage that the tenants opted for\ncasement windows. In April 2021, the tenants had been split 50:50 on the two\noptions. The approach adopted by the Respondent cannot be categorised as\nunreasonable, albeit that the sash windows were somewhat more expensive. We\nare satisfied that the Respondent had regard to the financial impact of the works\non the tenants.\n11\n\n41. In their Scott Schedule, the Applicants challenge 31 items relating to the cyclical\nworks. Most relate to the quality of the works. The Applicants have provided a\nBundle of 950 pages. This includes a large number of photographs. The problem\nthat the Tribunal faces is that none of the photographs are dated. The\nApplicants have produced no evidence of who took the photos or the block to\nwhich they relate. They are no more than \"snapshots\". They show areas where\nworks have not been done. These are often small areas in the context of a job of\nthis size. They do not show areas where works have been done to a good\nstandard. Some disrepair may have arisen after the works were completed.\nSome photos relating to general maintenance problems, rather than to the\nprogramme of cyclical works. Many of the defects may now have been remedied.\n42. The photographs illustrate the following:\n(i) Disrepair to the brickwork (A.7-16; 895-896).\n(ii) Broken Vents (A.24-27).\n(iii) Defects to the casement windows (A.31-36).\n(iv) Defects to the communal doors (A.42-57, 815-818, 855-860, 867-872).\n(v) Disrepair to the communal lights (A.58-62).\n(vi) The photographs illustrate numerous defects to the new doors and windows\n(A.68-89, 799-803). The Tribunal notes the communal window at A.73 where a\nblock of wood has been inserted between the base of the window and the\nbrickwork.\n(vii) External fencing (A.396-415. 789-798, 805-815, 864-866, 873-878, 899-\n904).\n(viii) Defects to gutter soffits and rainwater good (A.426-434).\n(ix) Pointing Defects (A.569-572).\n(x) Defects to the roof and guttering (A.575-625). The photograph at A.592\nillustrated the debris which was left in the guttering. The photograph at A.596\nillustrates dirty soffits. The photograph at A.608 illustrates a loose verge cap\nwhich required attention.\n(xi) Defects to the stone cills (A.651-664).\n(xii) Disrepair to the knee high fencing (A.786-788, 803-804,861-863)\n(xiii) Defects to grills (A,907-908);\n12\n\n(xiv) Moss and lichen on the roofs: Pentagon House (A.911-915); Welles House\n(A.918-922); Kingfisher House (A.925-932) and Meade House (A.936-942).\nThese photographs provide compelling evidence that inadequate attention was\npaid to cleaning the roofs.\n43. The Tribunal is satisfied that the photographs depict poor finishes, bad\nworkmanship and areas where defects still remain. Some items are fairly\nstraight forward. For example, there is ample of evidence to suggest the roofs\nhave not been properly cleaned. The same applies to the gutters.\n44. Some of the paint from the external decorations is peeling. The Tribunal would\nnot expect it to be peeling so soon after the works have been completed. The\nApplicants have provided a report from Dulux confirming that the preparation\nis poor . They had sent samples to Dulux for testing (A.781-785).\n45. Mr Jackson complained that there had been a problem of condensation in his\nflat after the new windows had been installed. We note that he is living in his\none bedroom flat with his wife and two children. We suspect that the\ncondensation problem is due to the interaction between the moisture produced\nwithin the flat and the equation of ventilation, heating and insulation. The new\nwindows are likely to have reduced draughts from the old ill-fitting windows.\nWe are not satisfied that the condensation relates to the negligent installation\nof the windows.\n46. In her witness statement, Ms Bedi gives detailed evidence of the steps taken by\nthe Respondent to supervise the works. Snagging items were identified and\naddressed. Ms Bedi also gives evidence of the contact which she had with some\nof the Applicants:\n(i) Mr Hoareau (2 Pentagon House): On 14 December 2022 (at HB.1026), Mr\nHoareau raised a number of concerns relating to the windows and door in his\nflat. On 3 February 2023 (HB.1014), she sent an email to Mr Hoareau stating\nthat the defects had been remedied. Mr Hoareau did not respond to this.\n(ii) Mr Puvendran (5 Welles House): In December 2022, Mr Puvendran\ncomplained that draughts were coming through his windows in the bedroom\nand living room. Symphony agreed to fit a thicker gasket as a matter of good\nwill. The correspondence is at HB.1027-1037). Mr Puvendran was not satisfied\nwith the Respondent's response and invoked their complaint's procedure. On\n10 June 2024 (at HB.1161-4), the Respondent offered him £450 in\ncompensation. Mr Puvendran did not accept this offer.\n47. The Tribunal addresses the additional following items raised by the Applicants\nin their Scott Schedule:\n(i) Asbestos: The Applicant complain that no asbestos was removed. The\nRespondent agree. This item was removed from the final account. We accept\nthis.\n13\n\n(ii) Repointing masonry (£189.81). The Applicant complains that this was not\ncarried out to a reasonable standard. The Respondent disputes this. This is a\nmodest sum which we allow.\n(iii) Removal/Refix of TV aerials (£379.62). The Applicant complains that only\none aerial was removed. The Respondent agrees, but states that this was an\nitemised cost which did not depend on the number of units. The Tribunal agrees\nthat it was reasonable to include this in the contract specification.\n(iv) Clean soffits and fascias (£1,391.94). The Applicants state that no items\nwere cleaned. The Respondent states that this work was carried out and signed\noff. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an\nadequate standard. The Tribunal disallows £700.\n(v) Clean stone sills (£1,265.40). The Applicants state that no items were\ncleaned. The Respondent states that this work was carried out and signed off.\nThe Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an adequate\nstandard. The Tribunal disallows £600.\n(vi) Apply mastic to windows (£5,036.55): The Applicants assert that this was\npart of the basic installation and should not have been charged separately. The\nRespondent asserts that the specification made it clear that this work was to be\ndone by a specialist mastic contractor. The Tribunal is satisfied that the\nRespondent was entitled to take this course.\n(vii) Overheads/profit and Attendance (£23,400). The Applicants contend that\nthis is a vague charge which cannot be justified. The Respondent replies that\nthis is a standard charge in the trade. The Tribunal agree.\n(viii) Rain water goods (£2,480.18). The Applicants complain about the quality\nof the works. The Respondent replies that the work was water tested and signed\noff. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an\nadequate standard. It does not accept that the debris shown in the photographs\narose subsequently. The Tribunal disallows £1,000.\n(ix) Clean Roof Tiles and replaced damaged tiles. The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. The Tribunal does not consider that this work\nwas carried out to an adequate standard and disallow £500.\n(x) External Decoration and Woodwork (£8,225.10). The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. They rely on their report from Dulux. The\nRespondent replies that the work was carried out to a satisfactory standard and\nwas signed off. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to\nan adequate standard and disallow £3,000.\n14\n\n(xi) Staining to woodwork (£5,061.60). The Applicants state that the woodwork\nwas not stained. The Respondent replies that the work was carried out to a\nsatisfactory standard and was signed off. We agree.\n(xii) Decoration to the communal doors (£1,898.10). The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. Although the Applicants have provided a\nnumber of photographs, they have not satisfied us that any reduction should be\nmade.\n(xiii) Replacement of damaged vents (£197.99). The Applicants complain that\nthey have been charged for 15, but only 11 were replaced. The Respondent\nreplies that the work was satisfactory and was signed off. This is a modest sum\nwhich we allow.\n(xiv) Replace sections of knee high fence (£1,600). The Applicants complain\nthat only one small section was replaced. The Respondent replies that the work\nwas carried out to a section of fencing on a client instruction. Although the\nphotograph indicate some disrepair to the fencing, the Applicants have not\nsatisfied that these sections were included in the contract. We allow this charge.\n(xv) Ridge tile replacement and repointing (£1,125). The Applicants complain\nthat this work was not carried out. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. The photographs indicate a number of defects\nand we disallow £500.\n(xvi) Brickwork repairs (£800). The Applicants assert that this was not part of\nthe cyclical works. The Respondent replies that it was. The work was checked\nand signed off. We allow this item.\n(xvii) Fencing repairs prior to redecoration (£450). The Applicants complain\nthat no fences were repaired. In any event, the fencing is not part of the estate.\nThe Respondent replies that minor works were executed to parts of fencing\nwhich fall within the estate. We allow this modest charge.\n(xviii) Pest proof vents (£360). The Applicants initially asserted that no vents\nwere pest proofed. The Applicants now accept that work was carried out to one\nvent but not to an adequate standard. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory. The Applicants have not satisfied us that we should disallow this\nitem.\n(xix) Rake out and repoint gaps to sub cills (£75). The Applicants assert that no\nwork was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and\nsigned off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xx) Rake out and repoint window heads (£75). The Applicants assert that no\nwork was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and\nsigned off. We allow this modest sum.\n15\n\n(xxi) Rake out and repoint side of concrete cills (£50). The Applicants assert\nthat no work was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed\nand signed off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xxii) Repointing of brickwork above rear door of 1 Welles House (£95). The\nApplicants initially asserted that only one was replaced. They now accept the\nneed to pay a reasonable amount. The Respondent replies that the work was\ncompleted and signed off. 16 verge caps were completed. We allow this modest\nsum.\n(xxiii) Supply and fit new dry verge caps where missing (£95). The Applicants\nassert that no work was done. The Respondent replies that the work was\ncompleted and signed off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xxiv) Rebuild bin stores (£595). The Applicants complain that this was not part\nof the cyclical works and the works were not completed to a satisfactory\nstandard. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and signed off.\nWe allow this item.\n(xxv) Remove ivy (£50). The Applicants complain that they have been double\ncharged as this was part of the gardening contract. The Respondent replies that\nthe work was completed as part of the cyclical works programme and signed off.\nWe allow this modest item.\n(xxvi) Repoint 5 window fills (£100). The Applicants complain that this is part\nof the window replacement and they are being charged twice. The Respondent\nreplies that the work was carried out to the first floor cills in three blocks. The\nworks were completed and signed off. We allow this modest item.\n(xxvii) CT1 window fills (£75). The Applicants complain that this was part of the\nwindow installation and they are being charged twice. The Respondent denies\nthat there has been any duplication. The work was carried out to the window\ncills on the first floors at Kingfisher House, Sovereign Hose and Meade Houe.\nWe allow this modest charge,\n(xxviii) Relay dropped tiles gable end Meade House (£1,700): The Applicants\ncomplain that this work was not done. The Respondent replies that the work\nwas completed and signed off. We allow this modest item.\n(xxix) Window and door replacement (£144,648 + VAT). The only issue raised\nby the Applicants is that of historic neglect. We have already rejected this\nchallenge (see [37(i)] above).\n48. The Tribunal have made modest deductions of £7,300 out of a contract in the\nsum of £364,777. Each Applicant is therefore entitled to a deduction of £304.17.\nHowever, whilst Mr Jackson and Mr Frederick paid their full 4.167%\ncontribution towards the works, Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau, Mr Latawiec and Mr\nOsman paid £186.57 less than his full share, whilst Mr Puvendran paid £226.82\n16\n\nless (see Table at [35] above). We consider that these sums should be credited\nagainst the reductions that we have made. Thus we make deductions of (i)\n£117.60 for Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau, Mr Latawiec and Mr Osman; (ii) £304.17 for\nMr Jackson and Mr Frederick and (iii) £77.35 for Mr Puvendran.\nIssue 2: The Service Charges for 2023/24\n49. The Service Charge Account for April 2023 to March 2024 is at HB.371. This is\nbroken down to the 4.167% which each tenant is required to pay. The total\nservice charge for the year was £1,685.53, whilst the budget was £1,586,88. The\ntenants were therefore required to pay an additional £98.65.\n50. The Applicants challenge six items. The Respondent has conceded three of\nthese:\n(i) Communal Electricity: The Respondent has agreed to reduce the sum\ncharged of £176.72 by £88.36.\n(ii) Smoke Vents & Fire Systems: The Respondent has recognised that there was\na mistake and have reduced the sum of £87.06 to £64.24, a credit of £22.82.\n(iii) Gardening Scheme: The Respondent has agreed to a 50% reduction from\n£167.75 to £83.33. The Applicants have provided a number of photographs of\nthe state of the garden (at A.892-894). Ms Kamba stated that the Respondent\nhad made the reduction as a gesture of good will.\n51. Three items remain in dispute:\n(i) Communal Maintenance/Repairs: £42.11. The Applicants had initially\nasserted that no communal repairs had been executed. Ms Kamba has produced\nthe invoices. The Applicants then complained about the quality of the works. At\nthe hearing, the Applicants confirmed that this item was no longer in dispute.\n(ii) Entry Phone: £48.35. The Applicants contend that there was no evidence of\nany work being done. Ms Kamba has provided details of the four invoices which\ntotal £1,160.44 at HB.436. We therefore allow this.\n(iii) Property Insurance: £259.33. The Applicants' complaint is that the budget\nhad included a sum of £41.16 had appeared in the budget, whilst the actual sum\nwas £259.33. The charge in the previous year had been £31.68. Ms Kamba gave\na full explanation for the increase in the insurance. The charge of £31.68 had\nbeen a legacy charge from their block policy. This reflected two factors: (i)\nCatalyst had undervalued its properties by some 50%; (ii) the cover had been\narranged through Legacy who had offered rates substantially below the market.\nLegacy have now withdrawn from the social housing market. Ms Kamba\ndescribes how Peabody had consulted on a proposal for a Qualifying Lont-Term\nAgreement for insurance. She provides reasons as to why insurance has\n17\n\nincreased. Peabody had explained why insurance had gone up on their website\n(at HB.475-8). The Applicants have not provided any evidence that insurance\ncould have been secured at a lower premium. We are an expert tribunal. We are\nsatisfied that an insurance charge of £259.33 is reasonable for these one\nbedroom flats.\n52. It is agreed that the Applicants are entitled to refunds of £194.51.\nIssue 3: The Interim Service Charges for 2024/25\n53. The budget for the year is at HB.550. The Tribunal explained that any landlord\nhas to make a judgment as to what sums should be included in a budget. When\nthe service charge accounts for the year are available, there will be a\nreconciliation between the budgeted and the actual expenditure. Further, any\nchallenge to the quality of the service can only be made at the end of the service\ncharge year.\n54. The Applicants challenge seven items in their Scott Schedule. They indicated\nthat they no longer challenge the figure for pest control (£4.32). The\nRespondent agreed to reduce the sum for communal electricity insurance by\n50% (£105.67).\n55. The remaining sums remain in dispute:\n(i) Gardening: £175.44: The Applicants complain about the quality of the\nservice. Work is sporadic and is not carried out to an acceptable or reasonable\nstandard. The Applicants confirmed that they did not dispute the sum included\nin the budget. When a budget is prepared, it must be assumed that works will\nbe carried out to an acceptable standard. We therefore allow this sum.\n(ii) Smoke Vents/Fire Systems: £183.48: The Applicants state in the Scott\nSchedule that there is no system in place. The Respondent replies that this\nheading covers the emergency lighting system from which each block benefits.\nThis is a 5% uplift on the 2023/24 estimate. We are satisfied that this budget\nsum is reasonable.\n(iii) Tree Surgery: £31.68: The Applicants contend that there are no trees on the\nestate that require surgery. In the Scott Schedule, the Respondent argued that\nthis was only an estimate and there would be a credit if there was no such work.\nAt the hearing, the Respondent took the contrary position. They agreed that this\nsum should be disallowed. If there is any such expenditure, it will be included\nin the final service charge accounts.\n(iv) Audit and Accountancy: £14.40: The Applicants argued that there was no\nrequirement in the lease for the accounts to be audited. The Respondent\nreferred to Clause 7 (5)(c) of the leases. In the light of this, the Applicants did\nnot pursue their challenge.\n18\n\n(v) Property Insurance: £427.68: The Applicants complain that this sum is\nexcessive. The Tribunal has found that the actual expenditure of £259.33 was\nreasonable. Whilst £424.68 had been included in the budget, Ms Kamba stated\nthat after the Section 20 Consultation, the tenants had been informed that the\ninsurance would be in the region of £400. The Tribunal accepts that insurance\npremiums are increasing. However, we are satisfied that the estimate of\n£424.68 was unreasonable. We allow £400.\n56. The Tribunal has made deductions of £162.03 to the budget.\nApplication under s.20C and refund of fees\n57. At the end of the hearing, the Applicants made an application for a refund of\nthe fees that they have paid in respect of these six applications. We understand\nthat they have paid £800, namely 6 application fees of £100 and a hearing fee\nof £200. The Applicants have only succeeded on a small number of points. We\ntherefore make an order that they should be able to recover 25%, namely £200.\n58. In the application form, the Applicants applied for an order under section 20C\nof the 1985 Act in respect of the cost of these proceedings. It is not for this\ntribunal to make a determination as to whether the landlord is entitled under\nthe leases to pass on these costs through the service charge. Section 20C (3)\npermits the Tribunal to make such order as it considers just and equitable in\nthe circumstances. Given our findings, we are satisfied that the Respondent\nshould be restricted to passing on 75% of their costs.\n59. The Respondent has not indicated whether it intends to pass on its costs\nthrough the service charge or as to the level of costs that it would intend to\ncharge to the tenants. The Tribunal records its concern that any such costs\nshould be proportionate. The Respondent has been represented by Counsel\nwith two representatives from her instructing solicitor in attendance. These\ntribunals are intended to be informal and have adopted procedures so that\nparties do not need to be represented. We note that it is always open to the\ntenants to challenge the size of any such costs through a separate application if\nthey consider these to be unreasonable. However, the Respondent is to be\ncommended for the constructive manner in which it has sought to respond to\nthese applications.\n60. The Tribunal also makes an order pursuant to paragraph 5A of Schedule 11 to\nthe Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 restricting the ability of the\nRespondent from charging an administration charge in respect of its litigation\ncosts. However, the Tribunal does not consider that this is strictly necessary, as\nit would not seem to be open to the Respondent to levy such a charge.\nJudge Robert Latham\n29 July 2025\n19\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of appeal they\nmay have.\nIf a Party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), then\na written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nregional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within 28\ndays after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person making the\napplication.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the\n28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide whether to\nallow the application for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the\ntime limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the tribunal to\nwhich it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number), state the grounds\nof appeal and state the result the party making the application is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n20"

On 19 December 2012, the Applicant had been granted a House in\nMultiple Occupation (HMO) licence in respect of 20 Evesham Road,\nLeicester, LE3 2BD (the Property) for occupation by 7 persons in 7\nrooms.\n2. On 16 February 2018 the Respondent served the Applicant with a\nproposed HMO licence, following the Applicant’s application to renew\nthe licence. The Property had been altered since the grant of the 19\nDecember 2012 licence, and now had 10 bedsit rooms. The proposed\nlicence provided for occupation for 5 persons in 5 rooms.\n3. The Applicant made representations on the proposed licence,\ncontending that the property was suitable for occupation by 10 persons\nin 10 rooms.\n4. On 27 June 2018 the Respondent served the Applicant with the HMO\nlicence. The licence provided for occupation for 5 persons in 5 rooms.\n5. The application is an appeal against the Respondent’s decision to refuse\nto vary the licence in the terms sought – Housing Act 2004 s.71, SCH5,\nparagraph 32 (1) (b).\n6. By the date of the hearing the only matter in dispute was whether the 5\nrooms for which a licence had not been granted were too small to be\nlicenced for occupation as bedsit accommodation. The Applicant\ncontended the rooms were not too small, the Respondent contended\nthat they were too small.\nInspection\n7. The Tribunal inspected the property on 7 November accompanied by\nthe Applicant and his representatives, and employees of the\nRespondent and their representative.\n8. The property comprises a centre terraced house of traditional brick\nconstruction surmounted by a pitched roof with various coverings.\nExtensive renovation and conversion works have been carried out and\nthe property is currently maintained to a reasonable standard.\n9. The Property contains 10 bedsitting rooms, one of which has en-suite\ntoilet and sink (A3), and another en-suite shower, toilet and sink (A4).\n10. The communal facilities comprise:\na) Small room containing a shower, toilet and sink on the ground floor\n(the ground floor shower room)\nb) A small cupboard type room, with a window, containing the boiler on\nthe ground floor (the cupboard)\n2\n\nc) A small shower room on the first floor (the first floor shower room)\nd) A toilet on the first floor\ne) A small rear yard, with access only from the front of the house for 9 of\nthe 10 bedsits\nf) A washing machine located outside in the rear yard, under a mono-\npitched roof shelter, with access only from the front of the house for 9\nof the 10 bedsits\n11. The accommodation on the ground floor comprises of an entrance hall\nwith access to bedsits A1, A2 and A3, the ground floor shower room and\nthe cupboard. Bedsit A4 is contained within a single-story rear\nextension, with its entrance at the rear accessed by an integral covered\npassage. Bedsits A1-A3 are licenced. A4 is not licenced.\n12. The accommodation on the first floor comprises bedsits B1-B4 and a\ncommunal toilet. None of bedsits B1-B4 are licenced.\n13. The accommodation on the top floor comprises bedsits A and B. Both\nbedsits are licenced.\n14. Each of the 5 rooms contained a bed, a wardrobe with drawers, a desk\nwith drawers, a small easy chair and foot stall. 4 of the 5 rooms\ncontained a dining/desk chair.\n15. Additionally, each room contained cooking facilities, comprising wall\ncupboard, sink/drainer, work surface, microwave with hob, fridge.\n16. The rooms were all small. The work space was limited. The wardrobes\nwere small, with 3 small drawers incorporated. The rooms were very\ntidy and did not have a “lived in” look. There were very few personal\npossessions apparent.\nHearing\n17. The Applicant was present, and was represented at the hearing by Mr\nSkelly of Counsel. For the Applicant, we heard oral evidence from Mr\nSimon Swanton, an Environmental Health Officer and Mr David\nBeaumont, a chartered surveyor. The Applicant filed a witness\nstatement. He was not required by the parties or the Tribunal to give\noral evidence.\n18. The Respondent was represented at the hearing by Mr Dymond of\nCounsel. For the Respondent, we heard oral evidence from Mr Matthew\nElliot and Ms Alison Lea, both Environmental Health Officers\nemployed by the Respondent.\nPowers of the Tribunal\n19. Section 34 of Schedule 5 to the Housing Act 2004 (“the Act”) sets out\nthe Tribunal’s powers on appeal:\n3\n\n34(1)This paragraph applies to appeals to the appropriate tribunal\nunder paragraph 31 or 32.\n(2)An appeal—\n(a)is to be by way of a re-hearing, but\n(b)may be determined having regard to matters of which the authority\nwere unaware.\n(3)The tribunal may confirm, reverse or vary the decision of the local\nhousing authority.\n20. It is accepted by both parties that the Tribunal is not acting as a court of\nreview but is required to conduct a “complete rehearing” (see Clark v\nManchester City Council [2015] UKUT 0129 (LC) at paragraph 40).\nOne of the consequences of the matter being a rehearing is that the\nTribunal has to consider the Property as it is at the date of the hearing.\nAccordingly, risks previously identified and subsequently rectified are\nnot relevant to this decision.\nThe Law\n21. The test is set out in section 64(3)(a) of the Act:\n“that the house is reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than\nthe maximum number of households or persons mentioned in\nsubsection (4) or that it can be made so suitable by the imposition of\nconditions under section 67”\n22. The number of persons specified in sub-section (4) is either the\nmaximum number specified in the application or some other maximum\nnumber decided by the authority. Accordingly, the issue before the\nTribunal is whether or not the Property is reasonably suitable for\noccupation by 10 persons, or whether it can be made suitable by the\nimposition of conditions by the local housing authority under section 67.\n23. Section 65 of the Act provides that for a property to be found reasonably\nsuitable it must meet the prescribed standards contained within The\nLicensing and Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation and Other\nHouses (Miscellaneous Provisions) (England) Regulations 2006 (“the\n2006 Regulations”). It is agreed by the parties that the prescribed\nstandards are met in respect of the Property.\n24. Section 65 (2) of the Act provides that the authority may decide that the\nhouse is not reasonably suitable for occupation by a particular maximum\nnumber of households or persons even if it does meet prescribed\nstandards for occupation by that number of households or persons.\n25. The effect of section 65 (2) of the Act is that satisfaction of the minimum\nlegal requirements contained within the 2006 Regulations may not\nnecessarily be sufficient for an HMO to be considered reasonably\nsuitable for occupation by a particular maximum number of households,\n4\n\nand that a local authority may impose conditions on an HMO licence\npursuant to section 67.\nThe Local Authority Guidance\n26. In this instance the Local Housing Authority has adopted the DASH\nguide which is a joint guide adopted by a number of Local Housing\nAuthorities in the East Midlands.\n27. In HMOs where cooking facilities are provided within the bedroom, the\nguidance of DASH and the Respondent on minimum floor space is 14\nsquare metres (sqm).\nThe issue to be determined\n28. The 5 rooms for which a licence was not granted are all less than 14 sqm.\nThe issue for the Tribunal to determine is whether, despite the rooms\nproviding less space than that set out in the Respondent’s guidance, they\nare, nonetheless, “reasonably suitable for occupation”.\nThe size of the rooms in dispute\n29. The Applicant instructed two independent experts to provide reports on\nthe suitability of the rooms, Mr Swanton and Mr Beaumont. Each expert\nprovided a set of measurements of the rooms. The Respondent provided\nits own set of measurements, as taken by its Environmental Health\nOfficers.\n30. The measurements of Mr Swanton were broadly consistent with those of\nthe Respondent. The measurements of Mr Beaumont were inconsistent\nwith both sets of measurements. When asked about this, Mr Beaumont\nwas unable to explain the discrepancy. The Tribunal prefers the evidence\nof Mr Swanton and the Respondent, as they are consistent with each\nother, and otherwise credible. The Tribunal finds, contrary to the\nsubmission of the Applicant, that the area forming the entrance within\nthe bedsitting room to B2 is not usable space and is excluded from the\nmeasurements. On that basis, the Tribunal finds that the size of each\nroom is:\nUnit Applicant Respondent Average Tribunal\nA4 11.13 11.02 11.08 11.08\nB1 9.68 9.68 9.68 9.68\nB2 10.19 9.74 9.97 9.74\nB3 9.07 9.04 9.06 9.06\nB4 9.32 9.55 9.44 9.44\n31. It is important to note that, despite the variations in the individual\nmeasurements of each room, on any of the proffered measurements the\nrooms were all significantly smaller than the Respondent’s guidance\nfigure of 14sqm.\n5\n\n32. The dimensions of the 5 rooms that are licensed by the Respondent, as\nmeasured by Mr Swanton, are:\nUnit sqm\nA1 10.14\nA2 11.71\nA3 14.4\nA 10.91\nB 11.3\n33. It can be seen that 4 of the 5 rooms that have been licensed are smaller\nthan the 14sqm set out in the Respondent’s guidance.\nNo category 1 hazards and no high category 2 hazards\n34. The 2004 Act brought in a new system for assessing housing conditions\nand enforcing housing standards. A local authority has a duty to keep the\nhousing conditions in their area under review, and they may (and\nsometime must) carry out inspections of specific houses to ascertain\nwhether any hazards exist at that house Ascertaining a hazard is carried\nout using a process of hazard scoring, under which hazards of specific\ntypes may be identified as either a Category 1 or a Category 2 hazard. The\nprocess of hazard scoring is the Housing Health and Safety Rating\nSystem (HHSRS).\n35. The parties agreed that there were no category 1 hazards present at the\nProperty. The parties agreed that whilst there were category 2 hazards\npresent, they were not high category 2 hazards, and any residential\naccommodation would have such category 2 hazards. The category 2\nhazards presented such a low risk of harm that those hazards were not\nmaterial to the granting of a licence.\n36. Although hazards were a factor in the Respondent’s initial refusal of a\nlicence, subsequent work had remedied the material hazards. The\nRespondent confirmed at the hearing that room size was now the sole\nreason for refusal of a licence, and not hazards.\nThe evidence for the Respondent\n37. The reason given in correspondence between the Respondent and the\nApplicant for the refusal of a licence for the 5 rooms was that the rooms\nwere “substantially smaller” than the 14sqm set out in the guidance.\n38. In its statement of case, at paragraphs 30-31, the Respondent provided\nfurther detail as to why it viewed the rooms as too small. The statement\nof case was prepared before the Applicant carried out further works to\nthe Property, and before the Respondent carried out a further inspection\non 22 October 2018.\n6\n\nMr Elliott\n39. At the hearing, Mr Elliott agreed that the further inspection revealed that\nsome of the concerns set out in the statement of case had been remedied.\nIn particular, he accepted there were no material hazards present at the\nProperty. Mr Elliott confirmed that, notwithstanding the fact that all\nmaterial hazards had been remedied, he remained of the view that the\nrooms were too small to be licenced.\n40. In view of the fact that the Respondent’s statement of case was prepared\nprior to its final inspection, the main evidence before the Tribunal of the\nRespondent’s reasons for refusing a licence other than that the rooms\nwere less than 14sqm, was the oral evidence of Mr Elliott and Ms Lea.\n41. Mr Elliott said that he applied a higher standard to A4, the self-\ncontained bedsit with the rear entrance, because it was a new build. As\nsuch the Applicant knew, or should have known, of the space standard\nand should build to that standard. His reason for refusing a licence for\nA4 was, therefore, largely because it was a new build and so should have\nbeen built to the guideline standard of 14sqm.\n42. Mr Elliott said that, even taking into account the recent works, rooms B1-\nB4 remained too small to be reasonably suitable for occupation.\n43. Mr Elliott said that with a bedsit, the question he asked himself was\nwhether someone could live in that room as their home.\n44. At the inspection, the rooms displayed very few personal possessions.\nThe wardrobe/drawer unit was small. He did not see how someone could\nkeep all of their personal possession in the rooms.\n45. Mr Elliott said that the need to store all of your belongings, spend all of\nyour time when at home, do all normal household things in a room so\nsmall, cooking, living, reading, having friends round, etc, was not\ntolerable in the long term. He said that the rooms would be acceptable as\na hotel room, but that they were too small if that was the only space you\nhad to call your own.\n46. In his view, the rooms were so small that to live in them would be\nintolerable in the longer term, and would have a detrimental effect on\nthe occupant’s mental health.\n47. Mr Elliott referred the Tribunal to the report of the Applicant’s expert,\nMr Swanton, at page 25 of Mr Swanton’s report, where Mr Swanton had\nstated that “the smaller than average accommodation will make it more\ndifficult to undertake normal household activities. In addition, there is\nlimited space for the storage of personal belongings. In view of this the\nlikelihood of a harm occurring over the next 12 months is greater than\naverage”. Mr Elliott stated that this showed that Mr Swanton agreed with\nhim.\n7\n\n48. It was clear that Mr Elliott’s aim was to seek to ensure that occupiers of\nlicenced accommodation had a decent standard of accommodation, and\nit was clear that he applied the correct test of whether the\naccommodation was reasonably suitable for occupation. It was also clear\nthat, in his view, the accommodation in B1-B4 was not reasonably\nsuitable because it was too small.\nMs Lea\n49. The evidence of Ms Lea was briefer. The material point from her\nevidence was that her explanation to the Applicant for the refusal of the\nlicence was that the rooms were substantially smaller than that set out in\nthe guidance of 14sqm.\nThe evidence for the Applicant\nThe Applicant\n50. The Applicant filed a witness statement. He was not required to give oral\nevidence. His witness statement set out the history of the licence\napplication, and his reasons for asserting the rooms were suitable to be\nlicensed. He stated that the rooms met the prescribed requirements set\nout in the 2006 Regulations in respect of amenities such as washing and\ncooking facilities. In addition, the rooms contained the following\nfurniture: standard sized double bed; desk with built in drawers; a\ndining/desk chair; twin door wardrobe with built in drawers and\nmirrors; a single easy chair; leather footstall and a bin.\nMr Swanton\n51. The Tribunal notes than at page 24 of Mr Swanton’s report, after the\nextract referred to by Mr Elliott in his evidence of “the smaller than\naverage accommodation will make it more difficult to undertake normal\nhousehold activities. In addition, there is limited space for the storage of\npersonal belongings. In view of this the likelihood of a harm occurring\nover the next 12 months is greater than average”, Mr Swanton goes on to\nsay “Despite this, there is adequate space for sleeping, living, cooking\nand recreational activities for one person.”\n52. Mr Swanton concludes, at section 5 of his report, that “in the absence of\nany Category 1 or significant Category 2 hazards, and in my opinion\nhaving adequate floor space in each unit of accommodation as well as\nadequate shared amenities, it is my opinion that the HMO is reasonably\nsuitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of 10\nhousehold and 10 persons.”\n53. Mr Swanton said in his oral evidence that the rooms were not dangerous\nor so hazardous that it would be intolerable for someone to live there. He\nsaid he asked himself whether the rooms were dangerous or not, and if\nthey were not dangerous, why can’t they be licenced. He accepted that\nthe rooms were small, but said that because they presented such a low\nrisk of injury, they were not intolerable.\n8\n\nMr Beaumont\n54. In his report, under Conclusions, Mr Beaumont stated that “bearing in\nmind that most of the property has been previously licenced, that most of\nthe rooms fall below the council’s adopted guidance standard but about\nhalf have been licensed under this application, that none of the occupiers\nare believed to have made any complaint about the accommodation and\nthat the rooms appear to be suitable for their purposes it is my opinion\nthese should be fully licensed for single occupation.”\n55. In his report, Mr Beaumont referred to the new minimum standards for\nbedrooms that came into force on 1 October 2018 by way of the Licensing\nof Houses in Multiple Occupation (Mandatory Conditions of Licences)\n(England) Regulations 2018 (the 2018 Regulations). Mr Beaumont\nsubmitted that whilst the Tribunal was not bound by the 2018\nRegulations, it should take account of them.\n56. The new minimum standard, set out in the 2018 Regulations, for a\nbedroom for one person is between 6.77 and 8.71sqm. The regulations do\nnot provide for a minimum space standard for bedsits.\n57. Mr Beaumont submitted that the new statutory minimum size for\nbedrooms should be increased by 2 to 2.5sqm for bedsits, to allow room\nfor cooking facilities. He submitted that on this basis the 5 rooms in\ndispute were all of sufficient size. In his oral evidence, he stated that his\nfigure of 2 to 2.5sqm was only his view and not based, for example, on\nresearch or other evidence.\n58. Mr Beaumont further submitted that the Respondent was rigid in its\napplication of its guidance, and also submitted that the Respondent was\ninconsistent in its decision making.\nDeliberation\n59. It is accepted by both parties that the rooms meet the prescribed\nstandard set out in the 2006 Regulations. It is accepted by both parties\nthat the rooms do not meet the space standard set out in the\nRespondent’s guidance.\n60. The Tribunal believes that a flexible approach is required in relation to\nadopting floor arears when considering Bedsit rooms as there is no\nstatutory guidance. Whilst the Respondent’s adoption of the DASH\nguide is accepted by the Tribunal as perfectly reasonable, it is the view of\nthe Tribunal that an holistic approach is essential whist still having\nregard to these aspirational standards.\n61. A floor area below the aspirational standard could be acceptable as\nproviding adequate space to enable a licence to be granted. The specific\nfloor area is important but it is not the only factor the Tribunal takes into\naccount in assessing suitability. Other factors include:\n9\n\na) Quality of floor area - that is how much is usable and how much would\ncontribute adequately to a standard of living. For example, areas in\ndark corners or too close to cooking areas are much are less desirable\nthan well-lit areas.\nb) Natural light - this is important to well-being and factors include the\namount of natural light as well as the quality of the same and its\neffectiveness in lighting of the room.\nc) The location of doors - how doors open into a room can dictate usage\nand in practical terms the placing of furniture and the limitation or\notherwise of circulation space.\nd) The shape of the space – this is important and, in some cases, a smaller\narea offering a good usable shape can be more attractive as a living area\nthan a larger space which may be awkward.\ne) Other accommodation that may be used in common with other tenants\nmay also be taken into account.\n62. The Tribunal finds that Respondent has not applied its guidance rigidly.\nThe fact that of the 5 rooms it has licensed, 4 are less than 14sqm, is\nevidence of its flexibility. It also finds that the Respondent has not been\ninconsistent in its decision making. The inconsistency asserted by the\nApplicant is found by the Tribunal to be the very flexibility the Applicant\nsays the Respondent must apply.\n63. The Tribunal is faced with expert evidence for the Applicant that the\nrooms are reasonably suitable for occupation, and expert evidence for\nthe Respondent that they are not so suitable.\n64. Mr Swanton’s oral evidence indicated he was not applying the correct\ntest in his assessment of the rooms. The test is not whether a room is so\ndangerous or hazardous that it would not be tolerable for someone to live\nin it. Whilst at page 24 of his report, Mr Swanton does address some\ndetail of the use of the room, it is in the context of hazards. He does not\nclearly address the test of whether the rooms are reasonably suitable for\noccupation. We do not disregard Mr Swanton’s report, but we do not find\nit to be compelling evidence that the rooms are reasonably suitable for\noccupation.\n65. Mr Beaumont does address the correct test, however his conclusion is\nbased upon several matters that the Tribunal does not find compelling.\nThe fact that the Respondent has licensed 4 rooms which fall below its\nminimum standard is not a reason for finding the rooms in dispute\nshould be licensed. Each room has to be assessed on its own merits.\n66. The fact that it appears, as asserted on behalf of the Applicant, that no\ntenants have complained about the accommodation is not a reason to\ngrant a licence. The test is not whether a particular person finds the\naccommodation to be suitable. It is not a subjective test, but an objective\none. In any event, a particular tenant may say their accommodation is\nsuitable for any number of reasons. They could have come from a lower\n10\n\nstandard of accommodation, for example, so by comparison the current\naccommodation may seem suitable to them.\n67. Mr Beaumont also based his conclusion that the rooms were suitable on\nhis analysis of the 2018 Regulations.\n68. The Tribunal accepts that it should take account of the 2018 Regulations\nwhere it is material to the issue in dispute. However, the 2018\nRegulations, which deal with the size of bedrooms, are not relevant to\nthis application, which is dealing with the size of bedsits. The Tribunal\ndoes not take the Regulations into account, and so does not take into\naccount Mr Beaumont’s view as to the additional space needed for\ncooking facilities.\n69. We do not disregard Mr Beaumont’s report, but we do not find it to be\ncompelling evidence that the rooms are reasonably suitable for\noccupation.\n70. The main evidence before the Tribunal of the Respondent as to the\nsuitability of the rooms in their current state comes from the oral\nevidence of Mr Elliott.\n71. It is right that, as Mr Elliott stated, the rooms were small and displayed\nvery little personal possessions. He is right that the wardrobe/drawer\nunit was small.\n72. However, Mr Elliott only provided limited additional evidence in support\nof his assertion that the room was too small to live in as one’s home. For\nexample, there was no provision of a floor plan with, say, the standard\nsized furniture that Mr Elliott may say was necessary for storage of all\npersonal possessions, imposed upon it, to demonstrate his assertion that\nthis would not be possible in rooms of this size, and/or the rooms could\nnot function as a home if furnished in such a way.\n73. For clarity, whilst there are no prescribed standards for furniture, such\nmatters are relevant to the suitability of the room for occupation for use\nas a home.\n74. The Tribunal is mindful of Mr Elliott’s experience, and of the comments\nin Clark v Manchester at paragraphs 39-41 of the weight to be given\nto the opinion of a local authority in applications such as these. However,\nit is also clear from the case that the Tribunal must make up its own\nmind, taking account of all of the evidence before it.\n75. The Tribunal does take into account Mr Elliott’s evidence, and places\nweight upon it, but has to weigh that up against the other evidence\nincluding, importantly, the evidence from the inspection.\n76. The inspection showed rooms that had the facilities and furniture\nasserted by the Applicant to be present, save that B3 did not have a\ndesk/dining chair apparent. The Tribunal had to consider how those\n11\n\nrooms would function with the amount of possessions one would usually\nexpect to be present in a room used as a home.\n77. Taking the above and, based upon the evidence before it, applying it to\nthe Property the Tribunal is of the following view.\n78. Room B1 – this room whilst having a modest and quite tight floor area is\nof a good shape and has a sufficient return by the door to allow the sink\nunits and cooking facilities to be reasonably located and not intrude too\nmuch into the main space. In addition, the door opens into the room\nallowing a full view upon entrance and is not restricted by the sink unit.\nThis gives a view direct to the window which is always preferable within\na small room. Accordingly, whilst this is at the lower end of the room\nsize spectrum it is the Tribunal’s view that it is suitable for a license.\n79. Room B2 - this room is immediately adjacent to the above. Both of these\nrooms appear to have been one in a previous configuration and a stud\nwall has been incorporated to create two rooms. However, the entrance\nto this room is now via a short hallway which is not well lit and this gives\na restrictive feel upon entry in the room. Also, on entry into the room\nyou are directly in line with the sink unit and cooking facilities and then\nyou have to manoeuvre around the corner of the stud wall into the main\na body of the room. The room itself is narrow and the need to put the bed\nunder the window against the wall does not yield good circulation space.\nThe hall access and the location of and protrusion of the sink unit into\nthe room creates an unusable area of floor space and this substantially\nreduces the usable floor area within this room leaving inadequate\ncirculation space which is not of a good quality with the whole being\nquite narrow. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that this room is\ninadequate for licensing purposes.\n80. Room B3 - Located at the rear of the principle building this room is\nadjacent to a communal wet room that has been installed. The\ninstallation of a wet room has had significant impact on the layout of this\nroom as this three-sided structure now takes up a not insignificant part\nof the original floor area. However, it is not only the loss of the floor area\nbut the protrusion is dominant upon entering the room creating reduced\nentrance into quite a small room. The entrance into the room is further\nnarrowed by the “kitchen area” immediately opposite the protrusion.\nThis means that the desk which forms a continuation of the kitchen unit\nis located partially under the work surface and this is the only way of\ncreating enough space to ensure the easy chair can be used. The bed is\nunder the window and the amount and quality of the circulation and\nusable space is poor. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that this\nroom is inadequate for licensing purposes.\n81. Room B4 - Located at the rear of the building in the original rear wing. It\nis a reasonably shaped room with a door opening onto the wall and sink\nunit adjacent on internal and right-hand wall. The kitchen fittings do not\nprotrude into the room too much as they are located on this short\ninternal wall. This room benefits from natural light from two windows\n12\n\nand whilst the room is at the lower end of the room size spectrum it is\nthe Tribunal’s view that it is suitable for license.\n82. Room A4 (outside) - this accommodation is self-contained and is\napproached by the shared covered entry to the rear garden. The structure\nappears to incorporate a small area of the original building but is\nfundamentally a new single storey construction. It was noted that some\nof the design and construction details were not of a high standard but on\nthe day of the Tribunal’s inspection issues of this type impacting on the\ndecision to be made were not manifest.\n83. Internally, the unit is quite narrow and despite being new construction\nthe natural daylight afforded by the two small windows is disappointing.\nHaving a more central door location does allow a design with the small\nbedroom area to one end and the kitchen and bathroom areas at the\nother. Accordingly, whilst this is at the lower end of the room size\nspectrum it is the Tribunal’s view that it is suitable for license.\n84. The Tribunal did note the Local Housing Authority’s position that as new\nconstruction the space should comply fully with the aspirational\nstandards as set out in the DASH guidance. The Tribunal is of the view\nthat whilst this would be desirable it is not enforceable and it is\nimportant to revert to the basic test which revolves around the suitability\nof the space provided for licencing purposes. The Tribunal is mindful of\nthe fact that with an existing property which as in this case was subject to\na conversion programme there are limitations imposed by the structure\nitself such as floor areas and ceiling heights. This still applies to an\nextension as again there are restrictions. In this case such restrictions\nrelate to the area of ground upon which the extension is constructed and\nthis was very limited especially in relation to its width due to the need to\nretain a rear access to the yard. This limitation amongst others will have\nrestricted flexibility in the design and any potential ability to reach the\naspirational standards.\n85. It is important to note that the 3 rooms that the Tribunal has found are\nreasonably suitable for occupation are very small, and B1 and B4, in\nparticular, are at the very edge of suitability. However, the Tribunal\nfound that the evidence of the Respondent that the rooms were too\nsmall, was not sufficient to outweigh the findings from the inspection.\nDecision\n86. The decision of the Tribunal is that the licence dated 27 June 2018 is\nvaried to “the HMO is reasonably suitable for occupation by not more\nthan the maximum of 8 households and 8 persons”.\n87. The condition at section 7 of Schedule 2 of the licence conditions to be\nvaried as follows:\n13\n\nGround floor Far Rear Bedsit (A4) 1 Person\nFirst Floor Front bedsit, left when viewed from front (B1) 1 Person\nFirst Floor Rear bedsit (B4) 1 Person\nEither party may appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\nPrior to making such an appeal, an application must be made, in writing, to this\nTribunal for permission to appeal. Any such application must be made within 28\ndays of the issue of this decision.\nS McClure\nJudge of the First-tier Tribunal\n10 December 2018\n14"

This is an application for dispensation from the consultation\nrequirements of S.20 Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. (the 1985 Act)\n2. The Applicant explains that urgent works are required to prevent\nfurther water ingress through the roof causing damage to Flat 5.\n3. The Tribunal made Directions on 7 December 2018 which required the\nApplicant to send to each Respondent a copy of the application and the\nDirections together with a form to be returned to the Tribunal\nindicating whether the application was agreed with, whether a written\nstatement was to be sent to the applicant and whether an oral hearing\nwas required. It was further stated that if any Respondent agreed to the\napplication or did not return the form they would be removed as a\nrespondent to the proceedings.\n4. By a letter dated 20 December 2018 the lessee of flat 2 confirmed she\nacted for all of the lessees and that they agreed with the application, did\nnot require an oral hearing and did not wish to remain as Respondents.\nThe application is therefore determined on the papers received in\naccordance with Rule 31 of the Tribunal’s procedural rules.\n5. The only issue for the Tribunal is if it is reasonable to dispense with any\nstatutory consultation requirements. This decision does not\nconcern the issue of whether any service charge costs will be\nreasonable or payable.\nThe Law\n6. The relevant section of the Act reads as follows:\n20ZA Consultation requirements:\na. (1) Where an application is made to a Leasehold Valuation\nTribunal for a determination to dispense with all or any of the\nconsultation requirements in relation to any qualifying works or\nqualifying long-term agreement, the Tribunal may make the\ndetermination if satisfied that it is reasonable to dispense with\nthe requirements.\n7. The matter was examined in some detail by the Supreme Court in the\ncase of Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson. In summary the Supreme\nCourt noted the following\nb. The main question for the Tribunal when considering how to\nexercise its jurisdiction in accordance with section 20ZA (1) is\nthe real prejudice to the tenants flowing from the landlord’s\nbreach of the consultation requirements.\nc. The financial consequence to the landlord of not granting a\ndispensation is not a relevant factor. The nature of the landlord\nis not a relevant factor.\n2\n\nd. Dispensation should not be refused solely because the landlord\nseriously breached, or departed from, the consultation\nrequirements.\ne. The Tribunal has power to grant a dispensation as it thinks fit,\nprovided that any terms are appropriate.\nf. The Tribunal has power to impose a condition that the landlord\npays the tenants’ reasonable costs (including surveyor and/or\nlegal fees) incurred in connection with the landlord’s application\nunder section 20ZA (1).\ng. The legal burden of proof in relation to dispensation applications\nis on the landlord. The factual burden of identifying some\n“relevant” prejudice that they would or might have suffered is on\nthe tenants.\nh. The court considered that “relevant” prejudice should be given a\nnarrow definition; it means whether non-compliance with the\nconsultation requirements has led the landlord to incur costs in\nan unreasonable amount or to incur them in the provision of\nservices, or in the carrying out of works, which fell below a\nreasonable standard, in other words whether the non-\ncompliance has in that sense caused prejudice to the tenant.\ni. The more serious and/or deliberate the landlord's failure, the\nmore readily a Tribunal would be likely to accept that the\ntenants had suffered prejudice.\nj. Once the tenants had shown a credible case for prejudice, the\nTribunal should look to the landlord to rebut it.\nEvidence\n8. The Applicant refers to water ingress causing damage to the property\nand has provided copies of two quotations detailing works to the\nchimney and flashing.\nDetermination\n9. It is clear that delaying the repairs can only cause further damage to the\nfabric of the building. The Lessees support the application and no\nevidence of the type of prejudice referred to in paragraph 7 above has\nbeen identified. In these circumstances, I am prepared to grant the\ndispensation required.\n10. The Tribunal therefore grants dispensation from the\nconsultation requirements of S.20 Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985 in respect of the works to prevent water ingress through\nthe roof.\n11. In granting dispensation in respect of part of the Application\nthe Tribunal makes no determination as to whether any\nservice charge costs are reasonable or payable.\nD Banfield FRICS\n10 January 2019\n3\n\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application\nto the First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office, which has been dealing\nwith the case. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28\ndays after the Tribunal sends to the person making the application\nwritten reasons for the decision.\n2. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to\nappeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide\nwhether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to\nappeal to proceed.\n3. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal and state\nthe result the party making the appeal is seeking.\n4"

On 15 March 2019, the Applicant issued an application seeking a\ndetermination pursuant to s.27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985\n(“the Act”) as to the amount of service charges 2014/5, 2015/6 and\n2\n\n2018/9 in respect of his flat at Flat 501, Samuel Garside House, De Pass\nGardens, Barking, IG11 0FQ (“the flat”).\n2. On 18 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Directions. It clarified that the\nappropriate respondents are:\n(i) The freeholder, Barkingside Riverside Limited (“BRL”) which is\nresponsible for the estate charges and has appointed Pinnacle Places\nLimited (“Pinnacle”) as its managing agents.\n(ii) The immediate landlord of the flat is Adriatic Land 3 (GR1) Limited\n(Adriatic), being the party responsible for the block service charge.\nPinnacle also acted as its managing agents until November 2018 and is\nresponsible for the 2014/5, 2015/6, 2016/7, 2017/8 and part of the\n2018/9 service charge years. The current managing agents are\nResidential Management Group (“RMG”).\n3. The Tribunal identified that the following service charges are in\ndispute:\n(i) An excess service charge of £531.79 payable for 2014/15;\n(ii) An excess service charge of £494.89 payable for 2015/16; and\n(iii) The interim service charge for 2018/19 in the sums of £916.90\n(demanded on 10 October 2018) and £916.61 (demanded on 18\nFebruary 2019).\n4. Pursuant to these Directions, each of the parties have filed separate\nBundles of Documents. There is a large amount of duplication. The\nparties have completed a Scott Schedule.\nThe Hearing\n5. The Applicant appeared in person. He was accompanied by two\ntenants, Yasir Iman and Ashley Akinfolarin. Neither had provided\nwitness statements. On 9 June 2019, there was a fire at Samuel Garside\nHouse. Twenty flats were destroyed. The Applicant’s flat was affected\nby smoke and water damage. The Applicant is currently residing at\ntemporary accommodation secured by the building’s Insurers. The fire\ndoes not impact upon the issues that this Tribunal is required to\ndetermine.\n6. The Respondents were represented as follows:\n(i) The First Respondent, BRL, were represented by Alex Elsy, a\nRegional Manager with Pinnacle. He was accompanied by Pamela Ross\n3\n\n(a Director of BRL), Andrew Smillie (Head of Estates at Home Ground\nwho collect the ground rents); Oliver Miller (a Director with Pinnacle);\nand Sophie Moore (a Property Manager with Pinnacle).\n(ii) The Second Respondent was represented by Andy Rose, a Property\nServices Manager with RMG.\n7. Although the issues in dispute were resolved by the parties taking\nrealistic positions, the Tribunal agreed to issue a short decision\nrecording the background to the dispute.\nThe Background\n8. Samuel Garside House is a block of 79 flats, all of which are let on long\nleases. The block was completed in 2011. It is part of the Barking\nRiverside Development which is scheduled to be completed by 2030\nwith a total of some 10,800 dwellings. It includes a significant number\nof social units.\n9. On 3 November 2017, the Applicant acquired the leasehold interest in\nFlat 501 for £306k. This is a two-bedroom flat which he occupies with\nhis wife and child. This is on the fifth floor. He occupies his flat\npursuant to a lease dated 28 August 2013 for a term of 125 years from 1\nSeptember 2011.\n10. Issues 1 and 2 relate to excess service charges for 2014/5 and 2015/6,\nservice charge years prior to his acquisition of his flat. The Applicant\ncomplains that he was not given a realistic indication of the level of\nservice charges when he purchased his flat. The charges are now much\nhigher than had been indicated. During his purchase, his Solicitor\nrequired the vendor to give the normal undertaking to discharge all\narrears of service charges due on the property up to the date of\ncompletion (see A54). The vendor agreed to retain a sum of £400 for\nthe balancing payment for the year 1 August 2017 to 31 July 2018. In\nresponse to an enquiry “Is any excess payment anticipated for the\nProperty at the end of the financial period?”, the reply was given: “refer\nto disclaimer”. The disclaimer read: “We are awaiting client approval\nfor YE 14 Accounts, YE15 is currently being prepared. The accounts are\nyet to be reconciled and we are not in a position to confirm the\nbalancing charge will be....”.\n11. The service charge provisions are to be found in the Fifth and Sixth\nSchedules of the Lease. There are two elements: “a block charge” levied\nby the Second Respondent and the “estate charge” levied by the First\nRespondent. The tenant is required to pay “a fair and reasonable\nproportion” of these charges.\n4\n\n12. On 24 September 2018, Pinnacle informed the Applicant that his\nannual service charge would be £1,833.80:\n(i) The budget for the Samuel Garside House “block charge” was\n£108,128 of which he was required to pay 1.4085%, namely £1,522.98.\n(i) The budget for the estate charge was £45,797, of which he was\nrequired to pay 0.6787%, namely £310.82.\nPinnacle provided budgets for both the block and the estate service\ncharges. The Tribunal was told that the proportion is worked out\naccording to the number of bedrooms in a flat. The formula is “the\nnumber of bedrooms in the flat + 1” compared with the whole of the\nblock (or the estate).\n13. The lease makes provision for the financial year to be 1 January to 31\nDecember, but gives the landlord the discretion to vary this. Both the\nFirst and Second Respondent have elected operate a financial year 1\nAugust to 31 July.\n14. As soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, the landlord\nis obliged to furnish the tenant with the service charge accounts, the\namount of the service charge costs to be ascertained and certified.\nThere have been unacceptable delays by both Respondents in providing\nthe tenants with the certified accounts. In the experience of this\nTribunal, it should be practicable for a landlord to provide accounts\nwithin an outside range of six months after the end of the financial year.\nAny delay requires an explanation.\n15. The lease provides that the tenant shall pay an advance service charge\non 1st January. In practice, the Respondents have demanded two six\nmonthly payments in September and February. The Applicant had no\nobjection to this practice. This is to his advantage:\n(i) The tenant pays six monthly, rather one larger annual payment.\n(ii) The Respondent’s should have draft accounts for the previous year,\nso that the budget reflects the actual expenditure in the previous year.\n16. The Sixth Schedule provides that where there is any surplus between\nthe interim service charge and the actual expenditure, the surplus is to\nbe carried forward to the next financial year. Where there is a shortfall,\nthe Respondents are entitled to demand an excess service charge.\nWithin 28 days of the issue of the certified service charge accounts, the\ntenant is entitled to inspect the relevant “vouchers and receipts” by\nprior appointment with the landlord.\n5\n\nIssues 1 and 2: Excess Service Charges for 2014/5 £531.79 and\n2015/6 (£494.89).\n17. The Directions required the Respondents to disclose all relevant service\ncharge accounts together with all relevant demands for payment. The\ndirections also identified that the Tribunal would need to be satisfied\nthat the sums demanded were payable by reason of Section 20B of the\nAct.\n18. Mr Elsy stated that the following demands had been made:\n(i) 2014/5: On 26 December 2016, Pinnacle gave the tenants the\nrelevant Section 20B notification that additional relevant costs had\nbeen incurred for which they would be required to contribute. On 9\nDecember 2017, Pinnacle had demanded payment of this sum when the\nservice charge accounts had been finalised. The demand was made\nmore than 28 months after the close of the financial year.\n(i) 2015/6: On 22 May 2017, Pinnacle gave the tenants the relevant\nSection 20B notification. On 2 May 2018, Pinnacle had demanded\npayment of this sum when the service charge accounts had been\nfinalised. The demand was made more than 21 months after the close of\nthe financial year.\n19. The Respondents had not included any of these documents in their\nStatements of Case. The relevant Section 20B Notices would have been\nserved on the Applicant’s predecessor-in-title. The Applicant had not\nbeen given any notice of these in the pre-purchase enquiries.\n20. The Tribunal indicated that it would require strict proof of service of all\nthese documents. The Respondents recognised the evidential problems\nthat they faced and agreed to withdraw these claims.\n21. The Tribunal records that the Respondents have also agreed to\nwithdraw an administration charge of £54 as a gesture of goodwill.\nIssue 3: The Advance Service Charge for 2018/9 (£1,855.86)\n22. The Applicant disputed the two interim service charges which had been\ndemanded, namely £916.90 on 10 October 2018 and £916.61 on 18\nFebruary 2019. He asserted that there had been an increase of nearly\n40% over the past two years. The Second Respondent disputes this in\ntheir Statement of Case (at Tab 1). It contends that the budget for\n2017/8 was £103,074.96, whilst that for 2018/9 is £108,127.76. This is\nan increase of £5,052.80 or 4.9%. This seems to relate to the block\ncharge.\n6\n\n23. The First Respondent has provided the “estate” service charge accounts\nfor 2014/5, 2015/6 and 2016/7 when the expenditure was £259,623;\n£291,807 and £278,848 respectively. Only part of this is apportioned to\nSamuel Garside House. The Tribunal understands that £47,151.46 was\nbudgeted for Samuel Garside House in 2017/8 and £45,797.00 in\n2018/9.\n24. The Applicant’s concern rather relates to the “block” service charge.\nDespite the Directions, the Second Respondent did not provide the\nrelevant estate service charge accounts for 2014/5 to 2016/7. Mr Elsy\nreferred to a document (at R2 Tab 5) whereby the budget for 2018/9\nwas constructed. The budgeted block expenditure for 2017/8 was\n£87,624.73 (namely £134,776.19 less £47,151.46), whilst the actual\nexpenditure was £103,074.96. The Second Respondent therefore\nbudgeted a figure of £108,127.76 for 2018/9. The fact that there was a\nsignificant overspend in 2017/8 is confirmed by two documents which\nwere provided to the Tribunal (i) the Section 20B Notice which\nPinnacle sent to the Applicant on 31 January 2019; and (ii) the draft\nestate service charge accounts for 2017/8.\n25. The Tribunal indicated the difficulty that the Applicant faced in\nchallenging an interim service charge which is based on an estimated\nbudget. His real concern was not with the budgeted expenditure, but\nrather the actual expenditure. The Applicant agreed and withdrew his\nchallenge to the interim service charge.\n26. The Respondents agreed to provide the Applicant with the block service\ncharge accounts for 2016/7 and 2017/8 and the estate service charge\naccounts for 2017/8. We would expect the Respondents to provide the\nApplicant with the 2018/9 service charge accounts by 1 February 2020,\nnamely within 6 months of the end of the financial year.\n27. Upon receipt of the service charge accounts, the Applicant will need to\nconsider whether he wishes to challenge any of the items of expenditure\non the grounds that they are not payable under the terms of his lease or\nthat they have not been reasonably incurred or are of an unreasonable\nstandard. The mere fact that the lift was out of order for a number of\nweeks is not sufficient. He would need to establish that his landlord had\nfailed to take reasonable steps to remedy the defect. A tenant should\nconsider obtaining alternative quotes if he wishes to argue that any cost\nis too high. Any case that services have not been of an adequate\nstandard should be supported by clear evidence. It is unclear how the\nrecent fire would impact upon the service charges that are payable.\nApplication under s.20C and Refund of Fees\n28. In the application form, the Applicant applied for an order under\nsection 20C of the 1985 Act. Although the Respondents indicated that\nno costs would be passed through the service charge, for the avoidance\n7\n\nof doubt, the Tribunal nonetheless determines that it is just and\nequitable in the circumstances for an order to be made under section\n20C of the 1985 Act, so that the Respondents may not pass any of its\ncosts incurred in connection with the proceedings before the Tribunal\nthrough the service charge. The Applicant has also sought an order\nunder Paragraph 5A of Schedule 11 of the Commonhold and Leasehold\nReform Act 2002. Such an order is not appropriate as the Respondents\ndo not intend to pass on any litigation costs.\n29. At the end of the hearing, the Applicant made an application for a\nrefund of the Tribunal fees of £300 that he had paid in respect of the\napplication pursuant to Rule 13(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier\nTribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013. Having heard the\nsubmissions from the parties and taking into account the\ndeterminations above, the Tribunal orders that the First Respondent\nrefund any fees paid by the Applicant within 28 days of the date of this\ndecision.\nJudge Robert Latham\n12 August 2019\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n8"

The Regional Judge found that this application to the extent\nthat it raised the issue of the service charge for the service charge year 2016/17 was\nidentical to the application made in this regard by the Applicant, Ms Sarah Jane\nSaunders, in case reference BIR/OOFY/LIS/2017/0044. Consequently, the Regional\nJudge directed in exercise of his case management powers under Rule 6(3)(b) of The\nTribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013 (‘the Tribunal\nRules’) that both sets of proceedings should be consolidated and that they should be\nheard together.\n2 In these Directions, the Regional Judge also indicated that he had added the freeholder of\nthe property, Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited, as the second Respondent to\nthe application made by Ms Babadi. However, he further directed that, as Park West\nRTM Company Limited had acquired the right to manage the buildings known as Park\nWest, the second Respondent should play no part in the proceedings. Nevertheless, the\nsecond Respondent should be sent a copy of the Tribunal’s decision.\n3 In addition, the Directions included an opportunity to object for any of the parties to\neither application.\n4 Following subsequent e-mail correspondence between Ms Babadi and the Tribunal, Ms\nBabadi applied in an e-mail dated 28 February 2018 to the Tribunal for an order under\nRule 23 of the Tribunal Rules whereby the application made by Ms Sarah Jane Saunders\n(BIR/OOFY/LIS/2017/0044) should be specified as the lead case in respect of the\ncommon issue, namely the ‘service charge year 2016/2017 in the sum of £1,872.49’. In\nthat e-mail, Ms Babadi also applied under Rule 23(2) for her related application\n(BIR/OOFY/LIS/005) to be stayed pending the decision of the Tribunal in the lead case.\nIn a letter dated 5 March 2018, the first Respondent, Park West RTM Company Limited,\nraised no objection to Ms Babadi’s e-mail application.\n5 On 12 March 2018, the Regional Judge issued Directions which identified the common\nissue in the applications made by Ms Sarah Jane Saunders and Ms Babadi as the ‘Service\nCharge year 2016/2017 in the sum of £1,872.49’, specified that the application made by\nMs Sarah Jane Saunders should be the lead case in relation to that common issue, and\nstayed Ms Babadi’s related application pending the decision of the Tribunal in the lead\ncase. The Directions also indicated that the decision of the Tribunal in the lead case in\nrelation to the common issue would be binding on all the parties to Ms Babadi’s\napplication, subject to Rule 23(6) of the Tribunal Rules which enables a party to Ms\nBabadi’s application to apply in writing to the Tribunal within 28 days for a direction that\nsuch decision is not binding.\n6 In the light of the resolution of this preliminary matter, subsequent references in this\ndecision are to Ms Sarah Jane Saunders (Ms Saunders) and Park West RTM Company\nLimited (Park West RTM) in their respective capacities as the Applicant and the first\nRespondent in case BIR/OOFY/LIS/2017/0044.\n2\n\nIntroduction/General Background\n7 This is a decision made in respect of an Application (‘the Application’) by Ms Sarah Jane\nSaunders (Ms Saunders), who is the leaseholder of Apartment 13, Park West, Derby\nRoad, Nottingham NG7 1LU (‘the subject property’) which was dated 13 November 2017\nand received by the Tribunal on 22 November 2017. Ms Saunders seeks the following -\nfirst, under section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, a determination of the\npayability and reasonableness of service charges in respect of the subject property\n(‘section 27A application’) for the period 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017; secondly, under\nParagraph 5 of Schedule 11 to the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, an\norder in relation to the liability to pay “an administration charge in respect of litigation\ncosts” (‘2002 Act application’); and, thirdly, under section 20C of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985, an order for the limitation of costs incurred by Park West RTM in\nconnection with these proceedings to the extent that all or any of those costs are not to be\ntaken into account in determining the amount of any service charge payable by Ms\nSaunders (‘section 20C application’). Park West RTM employs Walton and Allen\nManagement Limited (‘W & A’) as managing agents.\n8 This decision also incorporates the Tribunal’s finding in relation to an application by\nPark West RTM (BIR/OOFY/LDC/2018/0003) dated 17 April 2018, which was made in\nthe course of these proceedings and relates to the section 27A application, for an order\nunder section 20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 for dispensation, insofar as was\nnecessary, of the consultation requirements provided for by section 20 of that Act\n(‘dispensation application’).\n9 Directions were issued by a procedural judge on 7 December 2017 and by the Regional\nJudge on 13 February 2018 and on 12 March 2018 respectively. The former related to the\nApplication and were concerned, principally, with the processes associated with the\npreparation and submission of statements of case and related documents by parties to\nthat Application.\nAs indicated above in the consideration of the preliminary matter (see, paragraphs 1-6),\nsubsequent Directions issued on 13 February 2018 directed, inter alia, that application\n(BIR/OOFY/LIS/2018/0005) made by Ms Babadi be consolidated with the Application,\nand that proceedings relating to these applications should be heard together, whilst\nDirections issued on 12 March 2018, in pursuance of Rule 23 of the Tribunal Rules,\ndirected that the Application be treated as the leading case in respect of the common\nissue in each of the applications, namely the ‘Service Charge year for 2016/2017 in the\nsum of £1,872.49’ and that Ms Babadi’s application be stayed pending the decision of the\nTribunal in the Application. The latter Directions also indicated that the decision of the\nTribunal in relation to the common issue would be binding on all the parties to Ms\nBabadi’s application, subject to the invocation of Rule 23(6).\n10 Statements of case and related documents were duly filed by Ms Saunders and Park West\nRTM respectively.\n11 The Tribunal inspected the building known as Park West within which the subject\nproperty is situated, externally, on 19 March 2018 in the presence of Ms Saunders and\nher representative, Mr Healey, the representatives of Park West RTM, namely Mr\nWayman and Ms Tamsin Cox of Counsel, Mr Simon Temporal and Mr Brent Weightman\nof W & A, and Ms Babadi. Thereafter, an internal inspection of Apartment 65 was\nundertaken at the invitation of Ms Babadi, primarily, to view the external elevations from\ninside the building.\n3\n\n12 Following the inspection, a Hearing was held on the same day at Nottingham Justice\nCentre, Carrington Street, Nottingham. In addition to Ms Saunders and, her\nrepresentative, Mr Healey, and Mr Wayman and Ms Tamsin Cox of Counsel for Park\nWest RTM, Ms Babadi and Mr Temporal were present; the former as an interested party,\nthe latter to give evidence in his capacity as Property and Estate Director of W & A and in\npursuance of his initial witness statement. Mr Healey and Ms Cox presented the cases for\nMs Saunders and Park West RTM respectively. The latter submitted a skeleton argument\nto the Tribunal upon which she relied in making her presentation on behalf of Park West\nRTM. The Application was part-heard on 19 March 2018.\n13 The Hearing resumed on 24 April 2018 at the Nottingham Justice Centre. In the\nmeantime and at the request of the Tribunal, Mr Temporal had submitted a supplemental\nwitness statement dated 17 April 2018. Also, the dispensation application was made on\nbehalf of Park West RTM. The dispensation application was not heard on 24 April 2018,\nand, consequently, the Tribunal issued Directions on 27 April 2018 which provided Ms\nSaunders with an opportunity to respond in writing to that application with a right of\nreply in writing reserved for Park West RTM. Written representations in respect of the\ndispensation application, which were dated 14 May 2018 and 21 May 2018, were\nsubmitted on behalf of Ms Saunders and Park West RTM respectively.\nFacts\n14 The Application relates to the subject property which is situated in one of three purpose-\nbuilt blocks of apartments constituting Park West, 158 Derby Road, Nottingham NG7\n1LU (Park West) which was constructed circa 2003. Each block has a communal staircase\nand a passenger lift and comprises seven storeys. In total, there are 87 apartments within\nthe development. An inner forecourt provides access to and egress from the apartments.\nThe subject property is located in Block B. Park West is adjacent to a building known as\nthe Cigar Factory, a four-storey block of apartments, to which it is connected by a\nwalkway. The Cigar Factory has a service charge which is distinct from the service charge\nof Park West.\nPark West is bounded by Derby Road, Ilkeston Road, Elliott Street and Hermon Street. It\nis situated within a reasonable distance of Nottingham City Centre.\n15 Ms Saunders is the registered leasehold owner of Apartment 13, Park West, a title which\nshe holds under the terms of a lease dated 2 December 2003 and made between (1)\nSeasongreet Limited, (2) Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited, (3) Capital Invest\nLimited and (4) Sandra Healy and granted for a term of 999 years from 1 January 2003\n(‘the lease’). Ms Saunders was registered as the leasehold owner of Apartment 13 on 29\nAugust 2008.\n16 The second Respondent, Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited owns the freehold\nof Park West and the Cigar Factory. Park West RTM is a Right to Manage Company. It is\nresponsible for the management of Park West and, as indicated above, employs W & A to\nassist with that management. Ms Saunders is not a member of Park West RTM.\n17 The lease provides for the payment of a service charge by the leaseholders of Park West in\naccordance with the terms of clause 3.2. The meaning of ‘Service Charge’ is given in\nclause 1.7 of the lease. The lease also provides for the payment by the leaseholders of a\n‘Special Contribution’, which means, according to clause 1.8, any amount which the\nCompany (Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited, the second Respondent), (or,\npresumably, by inference its delegate, Park West RTM), ‘shall reasonably consider\nnecessary for any of the purposes set out in the Fifth Schedule…for which no or\ninadequate provision has been made within the Service Charge and for which no or\ninadequate reserve provision has been made under the Fourth Schedule, Part II,\n4\n\nparagraph 2(ii)’. Clause 3.4 of the lease provides that the leaseholders shall ‘pay to the\nCompany on demand any due proportion…specified in clause 1.8…of any Special\nContribution that may be levied by the Company.’ The Fifth Schedule relates, specifically,\nto ‘purposes for which the Service Charge is to be applied’, but, also applies, in view of the\nwording of clause 1.8, to the purposes for which the ‘Special Contribution’ is to be\napplied. The purposes set out in the Fifth Schedule include, inter alia, first, the costs\nincurred in management, for example, the costs and expenses incurred in the collection\nof rents and service charges and the costs, fees and expenses paid to duly appointed\nmanaging agents, and, secondly, the costs of decoration and repair of the exterior of Park\nWest. In the latter respect, the Fifth Schedule, Part II, paragraph 1(a) provides that\nredecoration of the exterior of Park West shall be undertaken:\n‘As often as may in the opinion of the Company [Holding and Management (Solitaire)\nLimited] be necessary to prepare and decorate in appropriate colours with good quality\nmaterials and in a workmanlike manner all the outside rendering wood and metalwork of\nthe Block [Park West] usually decorated.’\n18 Leaseholders are also obliged to observe and perform the obligations set out in the Third\nSchedule to the lease (clause 3.1). These obligations include the following obligation in\nparagraph 2(b) of the Third Schedule:\n‘To pay to the Company [Holding and Management (Solitaire) Limited] on a full\nindemnity basis all costs and expenses incurred by the Company or the Company’s\nSolicitors in enforcing the payment by the Lessee of any Rents Service Charge\nMaintenance Adjustment Special Contribution or other monies payable by the Lessee\nunder the terms of this Lease.’\nThe Application – Background\n19 The Application relates to the service charge demanded of Ms Saunders in the sum of\n£1,872.49 payable for the period 1 April 2016 until 31 March 2017 to the extent that it\nconsists of certain costs of and arising out of major works (‘the works’) comprising,\nbroadly, the external cleaning and redecoration of Park West.\n20 Following a consultation under section 20 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (‘section\n20 consultation’) conducted by W & A on behalf of Park West RTM, the contract to\nundertake the works was awarded to Building Transformation at a price of £81,254.68.\nThe works were to be undertaken by abseiling rather than through the use of scaffolding.\n21 W & A took responsibility for the management of the works prior to their commencement\n(pre-commencement project management) and for their management whilst those works\nwere being undertaken (project management during the site period). Initially, the costs\nfor such project management were £32,798.61 and £10,250.00 respectively.\n22 Additional costs were attributed to the appointment of an Architect (to carry out an\ninspection, produce a report and recommend appropriate finishes to be applied to Park\nWest) for a fee of £750.00, the provision of a secure welfare unit (portable toilet) for the\nuse of site operatives in a location adjacent to Park West at a cost of £4,231.25, and the\nappointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator (to provide advice and assistance on various\nmatters relating to health and safety) for a fee of £1,250.00.\n23 More specifically, the works to the extent that they are material to the Application were\ndescribed in the course of the section 20 consultation as follows:\n‘EXTERNAL CLEANING AND DECORATIONS TO THE PARK WEST\nBUILDINGS.\n5\n\nUsing an abseil company who will secure themselves to the building roof; abseil down\nand pressure clean all elevations; apply two coats of masonry paint to render and two\ncoats of stain to timber cladding; wash, rinse and leather off existing powder coated\nwindow frames, patio doors and glazing.\nTo pressure clean all elevations; apply two coats of Cream masonry paint to the existing\nrendered surfaces; apply 2…coats of woodstain…to the existing external timber full height\ncladding.\na Courtyard elevations\nb Elliott Street elevation\nc Ilkeston Road elevation\nd Herman Street elevation\ne Derby Road elevation\nMiscellaneous\ne Clean out all existing guttering…\nCONTINGENCY\nArchitects Fees\ng To carry out an inspection, produce a report and recommend appropriate finishes\nto be applied to this listed building within the Canning Circus conservation area.\nHealth and Welfare Facilities\nh To provide a secure welfare unit for the use of site operatives; includes lighting,\nheating, toilet, washbasin, hot and cold running water, sink unit, microwave oven,\ntable and chairs and drying room. This is a minimum requirement under CDM-C\nand HSE legislation. This will be located in the fenced off area adjacent to Elliott\nRoad.\nCDM-C Co-Ordinator\ni To provide suitable and sufficient advice and assistance in order to help\ncompliance with duties, ensure that the project is notified to HSE, Co-ordinate\ndesign work, planning and other preparation where relevant to health and safety,\nidentify and collect pre-construction information and advise the client on the need\nfor surveys etc., promptly provide pre-construction health and safety information,\nmanage the flow of health and safety information, advise on the suitability of the\ninitial construction phase health and safety plan and the arrangements made to\nensure that welfare facilities are on site from the start and produce the health and\nsafety file.\nFees & Management Costs\nj Pre Commencement Project Management:\nPre Commencement Section 20 Works; To included liaising with all sub-\ncontractors, suppliers, CDM-C Co-Ordinator, producing documentation, material\n6\n\nspecifications, liaising with architect, provide Bill of Quantities, programme of\nworks, site visits to meet with various contractors, and all pre-start administration\ncosts.\nProject Manager\nQuantity Surveyor\nPlanner/Programmer\nAdministration\nk Project Management – Site Period\nSection 20 Works; To included Project Management fee for liaising with all sub-\ncontractors, suppliers, CDM-C Co-Ordinator, producing documentation and\nmonitoring progress of works, liaising with architects and contractors, continued\nprogramming of the works by Planner/Programmer, daily site visits by Project\nManager, cost control by the Quantity Surveyor and all administration costs\nrequired to complete the works.\nProject Manager\nQuantity Surveyor\nPlanner/Programmer\nAdministration’\nThe Application - Issues in Dispute\nSection 27A application\n24 In her Application, Ms Saunders set out the following questions which she wished the\nTribunal to decide:\na. Has the RTM Company complied with the consultation requirements under Section 20\nfor the first set of works? If not, is the Tenant’s liability for these major works capped at\n£250?\nb. If the RTM Company has complied with the consultation requirements for the first set\nof works:\ni) Were the first set of works defective?\nii) Is the tenant liable for the Architects fee of £750?\niii) Is it reasonable to pay £4,231.25 (for each block) to hire a secure welfare unit?\niv) It is reasonable to pay the managing agent £1,250 to act as a CDM-C Co-Ordinator.\nv) Is it reasonable the managing agent should be paid £32,798.61 for Pre-\nCommencement Project Management given failings identified and overall cost?\nvi) Is the cost of £10,250 to Project Manage the Site Period reasonable?\nc. Should the RTM Company have undertaken a second S20 Consultation prior to\nentering into a new contract for works proposed to start in Spring 2018?\nd. Is the Tenant entitled to an equitable off-set for damages against the RTM Company\nfor the RTM Company’s breach of Covenant to Repair, given this work was needed in\n2012 (when Consultation was started and abandoned)? What is the extra amount now\npayable in 2017 – the extra cost on top of what the Tenant would have paid in 2012?\n7\n\n25 Subsequently, Ms Saunders made no submissions and adduced no evidence, either in her\nstatement of case, witness statement or, through Mr Healey at the Hearing, in relation to\nquestions c) and d). As a precursor to her challenge to each of the substantive matters\nidentified in parts i) to vi) of question b), Ms Saunders questioned in her oral and written\nevidence the validity of the section 20 consultation which had been undertaken. Subject\nthereto, matters pertaining to each of the substantive matters in question b) were\npursued by Ms Saunders within the context of the generic disputes which she identified\nin her statement of case as arising between the parties in relation to the section 27A\napplication. These were outlined as follows:\n‘1.1.1 DISPUTE 1 – The management fees charged by the Managing Agent\n(36% of total cost) to oversee these basic works are unreasonable due to non-\nperformance of some tasks stated, duplication of other tasks and (generally)\nbeing excessive in nature; a figure of 0-10% would be more reasonable and\nin-line with industry norms.\n1.1.2 DISPUTE 2 – The relevant major works were not of a reasonable\nstandard – The works were halted after a few weeks and have never recommenced. To\ndate, the reason for this has not been fully disclosed to any lessee.’\n26 Park West RTM rejected each of the above submissions made by Ms Saunders and\nresponded, broadly, as follows.\n27 First, Ms Cox stated in her skeleton argument, upon which she relied in presenting the\ncase for Park West RTM, that Park West RTM had performed the required consultation\nexercise.\n28 Secondly, as to the above generic disputes identified by Ms Saunders, Park West RTM in\nits statement of case refuted Ms Saunders’ submissions that the project management\nfees, which had been charged, were unreasonable in that tasks had not been completed or\nthat there had been duplication of tasks, and that, generally, they were excessive. Park\nWest RTM also asserted that there was a need for the architect and CDM-C co-ordinator\nto perform their respective tasks. In Park West RTM’s opinion, following interventions on\nthe part of W & A, the works had been completed to a reasonable standard.\nMs Cox added that the sums expended on the works and which had been challenged\nwere reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances and arose out of Park West\nRTM’s determination to limit the cost of the works, particularly by avoiding expenditure\non very extensive scaffolding; the net result was to decrease the overall cost, as an\napproach using scaffolding would have cost £100,000.00 more than was spent; the works\nhad been completed and to a reasonable standard, notwithstanding failures of Building\nTransformation, because Park West RTM and W & A had expended significant time and\neffort in bringing Building Transformation to account and in ensuring that the works\nwere completed ‘timeously and properly’. She indicated that the actual costs of the works,\nincluding the management costs, were less than was predicted in the section 20\nconsultation (including the costs of resolving problems with the standard of work\nundertaken by Building Transformation) and were reasonable within the meaning of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 (‘the 1985 Act’).\n2002 Act application\n29 In her Application, Ms Saunders made an application, the 2o02 Act application, for an\norder of the Tribunal which would reduce or extinguish her liability to pay “an\nadministration charge in respect of litigation costs”. The subject matter of this application\ncomprises two charges, each of £60.00, which had been included in her service charge\n8\n\naccount for 2017 for non-payment of service charge. These charges were described as ‘late\npayment admin fees’. Park West RTM opposed the making of such an order.\nSection 20C application\n30 In her Application, Ms Saunders made an application, the section 20C application, for an\norder of the Tribunal that costs incurred by Park West RTM in connection with the\nproceedings before the Tribunal should not be included as part of the service charge\npayable by her. Park West RTM opposes the making of such an order.\n31 The parties’ submissions on each of the above applications and on the matters to which\nthey give rise are set out in paragraphs 39-87 of this Decision.\nStatutory frameworks\n32 The relevant statutory provisions for the section 27A application, the 2002 Act\napplication and the section 20C application are as follows.\nSection 27A application\n33 Section 27A of 1985 Act, so far as material, provides:\n(1) An application may be made to the appropriate tribunal for a determination whether a\nservice charge is payable and, if it is, as to-\n(a) the person by whom it is payable,\n(b) the person to whom it is payable,\n(c) the amount which is payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it is payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it is payable.\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not any payment has been made.\n(3) An application may also be made to the appropriate tribunal for a determination\nwhether, if costs were incurred for services, repairs, maintenance, improvements,\ninsurance or management of any specified description, a service charge would be payable\nfor the costs and, if it would, as to-\n(a) the person by whom it would be payable,\n(b) the person to whom it is payable,\n(c) the amount which would be payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it would be payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it is payable.\n34 Sections 18 and 19 of the 1985 Act provide-\n18(1) In the following provisions of this Act ‘service charge’ means an amount payable by\na tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to rent-\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs, maintenance,\nimprovements or insurance or the landlord’s costs of management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to the relevant costs.\n(2) The relevant costs are the costs or estimated costs incurred or to be incurred by or on\nbehalf of the landlord, or a superior landlord, in connection with the matters for which\nthe service charge is payable.\n9\n\n(3) For this purpose-\n(a) ‘costs’ includes overheads, and\n(b) costs are relevant costs in relation to a service charge whether they are incurred, or to\nbe incurred, in the period for which the service charge is payable or in an earlier of later\nperiod.\n19(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the amount of a service\ncharge payable for a period-\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the carrying out of works, only\nif the services or works are of a reasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.\n(2) Where a service charge is payable before the relevant costs are incurred, no greater\namount than is reasonable is so payable, and after the relevant costs have been incurred\nany necessary adjustment shall be made by repayment, reduction or subsequent charges\nor

section 20 consultation (validity), management costs (pre-commencement and\nproject management (site period) and the specific costs for the Architect, health and\nwelfare facilities and the CDM-C co-ordinator.\nSection 20 consultation – validity\n40 Initially, Ms Saunders in her witness statement dated 10 January 2018, which\naccompanied her similarly dated statement of case that had been submitted on her behalf\nby Mr Healey, referred to a section 20 consultation relating to the external painting of\nPark West that had been initiated by W & A in 2012 (‘2012 consultation’). In this regard,\nMs Saunders stated that she received a Stage 1 consultation letter from W & A in March\n2012. She added that she did not respond to this letter as she did not wish to suggest any\ncontractor from whom a quote for the proposed work might be sought. Ms Saunders\nintimated that, thereafter, she did not hear anything further in relation to this\nconsultation. In her statement of case, Ms Saunders indicated that this letter made\nreference to the painting work that was proposed and, in respect of that work, to the\nerection of full height scaffolding, the removal of paint and painting equipment and\npurchase of a pavement licence. At the Hearing, Mr Healey opined that these proposed\nworks may have been undertaken at a lower cost than the cost of the works.\n11\n\n41 In her witness statement, Ms Saunders also outlined the manner in which the section 20\nconsultation which was pertinent to her Application was conducted referring to various\nconsultation letters she received from W & A. Further, as will be seen (see, paragraphs\n42-44), Ms Saunders referred in her statement of case to these letters and the notices\nwhich accompanied them in furtherance of the section 20 consultation.\n42 Hence, in her witness statement, Ms Saunders stated that she received the Stage 1\nconsultation letter relating to the section 20 consultation pertaining to her Application\nfrom W & A in the post ‘in the middle of April 2015’. The letter was dated 13 April 2015. It\nindicated that there were 30 days within which any suggestions about a company which\nmight be approached to provide a quote for the works should be made and that such\nsuggestions should be submitted no later than 13 May 2015. Ms Saunders intimated that\nshe received this letter a couple of days after 13 April 2015. Ms Saunders opined that this\ndid not allow sufficient days for responses and that the period should have been ‘30 days\nafter allowing a few days for postage time’. In the event, Ms Saunders said that she did\nnot suggest any contractor to whom an approach might be made.\n43 Further, Ms Saunders explained that she received the Stage 2 consultation letter sent by\nW & A on 4 June 2015. Ms Saunders stated that this letter was dated 1 June 2015 and\nprovided that responses to it should be submitted no later than 1 July 2015. On reading\nthe letter, Ms Saunders said she was concerned about the relative costs of carrying out\nthe works and the project management costs of W & A, the breakdown of the project\nmanagement costs which included matters which she had not seen in other section 20\nconsultation exercises with which she was familiar and, in view of the work to be\nundertaken, the need for and costs of an Architect, health and welfare facilities and a\nCDM-C co-ordinator. Ms Saunders indicated that she posted a response to W & A within\nthe 30 day deadline, although she could not remember when it was sent nor did she keep\na copy of her response. Her recollection was that she raised the following in her response\n– the suitability of the companies, which had submitted quotes for the external painting\nat Park West, following checks which she had carried out at Companies House and which\nshowed that Balmoral Interiors Limited was a carpet, rug, floor and wall covering\ncompany, whilst Building Transformation Limited was a dormant company; the\nappointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator when this was a small job; the perceived\nunreasonably high pre-commencement and site period management fees of W & A; her\ninquiries in a paint shop which suggested that the proposed two coats of paint on the\nrender with a view to securing a 10 year guarantee would be insufficient in the absence of\npre-works and primers/undercoats; the question of whether render should be painted;\nthe appointment of an Architect when Park West is not a listed building and when the\nworks did not involve any redesign, and, finally, the failure of W & A to properly manage\nPark West and their abandonment of previous consultations.\n44 Ms Saunders indicated that she received the Stage 3 consultation letter in August 2015.\nThis stated that the contract for the works had been awarded to Building Transformation.\nMs Saunders pointed out that the documents accompanying that letter included a\nsummary of observations, which had been made by leaseholders in response to the Stage\n2 consultation letter, although it was stated that any comments received after the\ndeadline of 1 July 2015 were not included. She noticed that her comments were not\nincluded within the summary even though her comments had been made within the\nspecified 30 days. Ms Saunders noted that some leaseholders had raised matters which\nshe had highlighted in her response to the Stage 2 consultation letter, namely the high\nproject management fee and the necessity for the appointments of the Architect and the\nCDM-C co-ordinator. The high cost of the provision of the health and welfare facilities\nhad also been alluded to by some respondents. At the Hearing, Mr Healey suggested that\nif Ms Saunders’ comments had been taken into account the dispute about the costs\nrelating to the works may have been avoided.\n12\n\n45 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders reiterated, inter alia, the opinion which she had\nexpressed in her witness statement that the Stage 1 consultation letter (notice) relating to\nthe section 20 consultation pertaining to her Application did not allow sufficient time for\nleaseholders to respond; no time had been allowed in the stated 30 day response period\nfor posting. In this respect, Ms Saunders cited Trafford Housing Trust Ltd v Rubenstein\nand others [2013] UKUT 581 in which, in the opinion of Ms Saunders, the Upper\nTribunal decided that for the purposes of determining the date upon which the 30 day\nconsultation period ends the date of the notice was not the date it was printed nor the\ndate upon which it was posted, but rather the date upon which (depending on the means\nof delivery) it can be expected to be delivered to the person being consulted. From this,\nMs Saunders concluded that in relation to the Stage 1 consultation letter (notice) no\nallowance was made for the posting of the letter (notice) as the letter (notice) was\nprepared on 13 April 2015 and required a response by 13 May 2015. In this circumstance,\nshe suggested that it could be argued that the absence of an allowance for posting\ninvalidates this notice. Subsequent letters (notices) also failed to meet the ‘one calendar\nmonth deadline’. However, Ms Saunders accepted that she did not feel that she was\nprejudiced by this error, because she did not send a response to the Stage 1 consultation\nletter (notice) and did not plan to nominate any contractor. Ms Saunders confirmed this\nlack of prejudice at the Hearing.\nOn Day 1 of the Hearing, Mr Healey submitted that Ms Saunders had presented sufficient\nevidence to warrant a finding that the section 20 consultation requirements had not been\nmet and that, as a consequence, the £250.00 cap on Ms Saunders’ liability to contribute\nto the cost of the works might be imposed.\n46 Ms Saunders added that some confusion had arisen among leaseholders because a\nsimultaneous section 20 consultation exercise had been conducted by W & A for works to\nthe exterior of the Cigar Factory.\n47 In her skeleton argument, Ms Cox stated that the section 20 consultation had been\nperformed as required by section 20 the 1985 Act and Regulation 7 and Part II of the\nFourth Schedule to the Service Charge (Consultation etc.) (England) Regulations 2003\n(‘2003 Regulations’). In this respect, Ms Cox explained that an initial notice dated 13\nApril 2015 had been served which set out what works were proposed and the reasons for\nthose works, and invited observations from leaseholders and nominations from\nleaseholders for contractors to carry out the works, whilst a further notice provided\ndetails of two of the estimates which had been received, namely those estimates tendered\nby PWC and Building Transformation, and observations from leaseholders were invited.\nMs Cox stated that the final notice informed leaseholders that the contract for the works\nhad been awarded to Building Transformation. At the Hearing and within the context of\nthis sequence of notices, Ms Cox discounted in the course of questioning Ms Saunders,\nfirst, the company searches which Ms Saunders had conducted noting, in particular, that\nBuilding Transformation which had been awarded the contract to carry out the works\nclearly differed from the company in respect of which Ms Saunders had carried out her\nsearch, and, secondly, the opinion which Ms Saunders said had been expressed by the\npaint shop as to the manner in which the painting of Park West should be undertaken –\nthis was neither evidence nor the opinion of an expert.\nMs Cox informed the Tribunal that the leaseholders of Park West were provided with\ncopies of the equivalent notices relating to the Cigar Factory. However, Ms Cox averred\nthat the costs relating to the Cigar Factory were irrelevant to the determination of the\nApplication, because those costs were not charged to the residents of Park West and do\nnot form part of the demand challenged by the Applicant. In his evidence, Mr Temporal\nconfirmed that, initially, estimates had been sought for work to be undertaken on Park\nWest and the Cigar Factory and that the projected costs in the resulting specifications\n13\n\nwere apportioned between the two buildings. Ms Cox noted that work had not begun on\nthe Cigar Factory because of insufficient funds.\n48 Ms Cox also addressed the question of the validity of the notices which had been raised,\nspecifically, by Ms Saunders in her Application and, subsequently, in her statement of\ncase and witness statement. In this regard, Ms Cox denied Ms Saunders’ statement that\nthe section 20 notices served on her by Park West RTM arrived after the date stated in\nthem with the result that Ms Saunders had those notices for a few days less than the 30-\nday relevant period specified in the Regulations. If, however, Ms Saunders’ statement to\nthis effect was taken to be correct, Ms Cox stated that Park West RTM sought\ndispensation in respect of those few days under section 20ZA of the 1985 Act. In this\nrespect, Ms Cox reminded the Tribunal that Ms Saunders had admitted, expressly, in her\nstatement of case that she suffered no prejudice as a result of the delay which she said\nhad occurred. Further, Ms Cox informed the Tribunal that the section 20 process was\nstreamlined in such a way that such a delay, if it occurred which was not accepted, could\nnot have caused any prejudice. In this respect, Ms Cox indicated that responses from\nleaseholders were invited by e-mail with the result that time could be saved in replying,\nand all the details about the works were provided with the notices and, hence, there was\nno need for leaseholders to visit the Agent’s offices to find out details about the works.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the standard form of wording used in the notices, Ms Cox\nintimated that late responses from leaseholders were accepted and considered after the\nvarious deadlines. In his oral evidence, Mr Temporal informed the Tribunal that W & A\nhad not received a letter from Ms Saunders in response to the Stage 2 consultation notice,\nbut, in his opinion, the matters relating to the works which Ms Saunders recalled raising\nin her letter were covered in the replies given by W & A to queries raised by other\nleaseholders.\nIn her skeleton argument, Ms Cox supported the grant of dispensation, insofar as it was\nnecessary, on the grounds that no prejudice had been suffered, which had been admitted\nby Ms Saunders, and no suggestion had been made by Ms Saunders that an alteration in\nthe timing would or could have altered the outcome of the section 20 procedure. In doing\nso, Ms Cox referred the Tribunal to the Supreme Court judgment in Daejan v Benson\n[2013] UKSC 14 (‘Daejan’). She submitted that there was no justification for imposing a\n£250.00 cap on the recovery of costs from Ms Saunders.\n49 Park West RTM made a formal application for dispensation, the dispensation\napplication, which was dated 17 April 2018 and received by the Tribunal on 19 April 2018\n(see, paragraph 8), and variously described on Park West RTM’s behalf as made ‘for\ncompleteness’ and as a ‘formality’ in the light of Ms Saunders’ persistence on Day 1 of the\nHearing with the argument that the section 20 consultation requirements had not been\nmet. The dispensation application included a request for it to be heard on Day 2 of the\nHearing. However, the Tribunal decided that, in view of the proximity to Day 2, namely\n24 April 2018, Ms Saunders should be afforded the opportunity to respond in writing to\nthe dispensation application. Accordingly, Directions were issued by the Tribunal on 28\nApril 2018 which provided for the making of written representations by the parties (see,\nparagraph 13). The dispensation related to the above submission by Ms Saunders that, in\nview of the service of the section 20 notices on her by Park West RTM days after the date\nstated on them, she had been allowed less than the 30 day ‘relevant period’ provided for\nin the 2003 Regulations within which to respond to those notices. Without admitting this\nsubmission, Park West RTM sought dispensation in respect of the few days to which Ms\nSaunders had referred pursuant to section 20ZA of the 1985 Act.\n50 Mr Healey submitted a written statement on behalf of Ms Saunders in response to the\ndispensation application, which was dated 14 May 2018 and received by the Tribunal on\n16 May 2018. In this statement, Mr Healey made the following points. He reiterated the\ncircumstances pertaining to and perceived shortcomings in the service of each of the\n14\n\nsection 20 notices on Ms Saunders and stated that Ms Saunders ‘does not advance any\nargument that significant prejudice was suffered, or that she incurred a financial loss as\nresult of the failure to properly consult.’ Moreover, Mr Healey repeated that Ms Saunders\nhad indicated, previously, at the Hearing that she did not feel that she had suffered any\nprejudice as a result of the failure by Park West RTM to give sufficient time for the\nnotices to be received after posting. Consequently, Mr Healey opined that the\ndispensation application was neither inevitable nor absolutely necessary rather it was\nmade simply ‘for completeness’ and to protect Park West RTM’s position. Nevertheless,\nMr Healey informed the Tribunal that Ms Saunders did not resist the dispensation sought\nby Park West RTM. In these circumstances, however, Mr Healey submitted that any\ndispensation granted should be subject to the ‘reasonable’ condition that the Tribunal in\nmaking its determination in respect of the section 20C application finds that no costs\nincurred in relation to the dispensation application should be recoverable through the\nservice charge, or, otherwise, be so granted in the interests of fairness and justice.\n51 Park West RTM responded to the written representations submitted by Mr Healey on\nbehalf of Ms Saunders in respect of the dispensation application in a written statement of\nreply submitted by Mr Wayman on its behalf which was dated 21 May 2018 and received\nby the Tribunal on 22 May 2018. In that reply, Mr Wayman made a number of\nstatements. First, he stated that it was wholly unreasonable for Ms Saunders to put Park\nWest RTM to the cost of making the dispensation application, and, in particular, to the\ncost of dealing with extensive submissions, only to confirm that she did not resist the\napplication. Secondly, Ms Saunders had accepted as part of her application that no\nprejudice had been caused by the “short” notices served by Park West RTM. In light of\nthis, Mr Wayman considered that it was surprising, therefore, that this matter was\nregarded as an issue by Ms Saunders during Day 1 of the Hearing and that the Tribunal\nhad been invited to impose the statutory cap on recoverable service charge sums for the\nworks. This prompted Park West RTM to make the formal application for dispensation.\nMoreover, Mr Wayman added that on Day 2 of the Hearing, despite having considered\nthe original and updated skeleton arguments presented by Ms Cox, heard submissions by\nMs Cox dealing with the section 20ZA point, and having read the dispensation\napplication which set out Park West RTM’s position, Ms Saunders maintained her\nposition that the ‘”short notices” remained an issue. In these circumstances, Mr Wayman\nsuggested that a reasonable party should at the very least have consented to the\ndispensation application on Day 2 of the Hearing, which Ms Saunders chose not to do.\nConsequently, it was submitted by Mr Wayman that it was particularly inappropriate for\nPark West RTM to have to respond to Ms Saunders’ request that the granting of the\ndispensation application should be factored into the Tribunal’s determination of the\nsection 20C application and, moreover, that Park West RTM should be barred from\nputting the costs of the dispensation application through the service charge regime.\nMr Wayman described Ms Saunders’ conduct in respect of these matters as ‘risible’.\nManagement Fees\n52 In her witness statement, Ms Saunders indicated that during the section 20 consultation\nshe had expressed the view that the ‘pre and during work fees proposed by W & A were\nunreasonably high’ bearing in mind that the works comprised ‘a basic paint of the outside\nof the building’. Ms Saunders indicated that the breakdown of the management fees\nincluded items which she had not seen in other section 20 consultation exercises with\nwhich she had been involved, and, in her opinion, those project management fees were\ndisproportionate to the overall costs of the redecoration works undertaken. Ms Saunders\nalso expressed concern about the need for and, costs of, the Architect, health and welfare\nfacilities and the CDM-C co-ordinator. Ms Saunders re-iterated that other Park West\n15\n\nleaseholders had commented during the section 20 consultation on the high project\nmanagement fee.\nIn its statement of case, Park West RTM intimated that W & A had carried out a\nsignificant amount of work in fulfilling their management function, especially in their\nliaison with Building Transformation and in securing the completion of the works, and\ntime sheets had been provided to the Tribunal which gave an indication of the volume of\nwork undertaken by W & A in return for the project management fee. Further, in her\nskeleton argument, Ms Cox opined that Ms Saunders’ objection that the project\nmanagement fees charged by W & A, when aggregated, amounted to a relatively high\nproportion of the costs of the works was based on an overly simplistic approach. Ms Cox\nsaid that details of the work for which monies were required can be found in the second\nof the section 20 notices. She also alluded to an agreement between Park West RTM and\nW & A dated 1 April 2016 (‘2016 agreement’), which was presented in evidence by Mr\nTemporal as part of his supplemental witness statement, that provides for the payment of\nproject management fees to W & A in accordance with Schedule 2 to that agreement.\nMs Cox submitted that the costs relating to the appointment of the Architect, the\nprovision of the health and welfare facilities and the appointment of the CDM-C co-\nordinator were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount.\n(i) Pre-commencement Management Costs\n53 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders referred to these costs which were stated by W & A\nto relate to all tasks prior to the start of the works and which, according to the\nspecification, included meeting contractors on site, issuing notices to leaseholders and\ncontractors, liaising with suppliers and the CDM-C co-ordinator. In Ms Saunders’\nopinion, the works amounted to a re-paint of the outside of Park West which is required\n‘every so often’, and such an undertaking did not give rise to ‘out of the ordinary’ project\nmanagement tasks prior to the commencement of the works. Consequently, Ms Saunders\nsubmitted that the pre-commencement management costs of £32,798.61 were too high\nand unreasonable.\n54 In her skeleton argument, Ms Cox made the following points about the pre-\ncommencement management costs which had been incurred by Park West RTM. First,\nextensive pre-commencement work was required because the works related to a very\nlarge building. It was necessary to devise a cost-effective and safe strategy for carrying\nout the work and to prepare an appropriate schedule of works. During the planning\nprocess, it was clear that cleaning the render would neither suffice nor be efficient. As a\nconsequence, it was necessary to find out what finishes could be applied to the render\nand to take advice with a view to ensuring that any finish which was applied would have a\nreasonable lifespan. Advice was also required to take account of Park West’s location in a\nconservation area. Secondly, W & A have extensive experience of this type of project and\nanticipated, correctly, that the works would require ‘extensive input of their time’. Much\nof that time had been spent liaising with leaseholders, especially with those who were\nunable to pay their share of the costs immediately (payment plans were offered where\nnecessary). This was important because Park West RTM has no independent funds\nmaking it imperative that the costs of the works can be collected in full before the works\nproceed. Thirdly, the pre-commencement time that was spent in ensuring that the works\nwere carried out ‘in the best manner and for the best price’ meant that an additional\n£100,000.00 scaffolding cost was avoided. Park West RTM had adduced in evidence a\nquotation from Tubitt Scaffolding Ltd. dated 18 December 2014 for the supply, erection\nand design of independent scaffolding ‘for the purpose of giving access to all external\nelevations with a fully boarded scaffold and ladder access’ and scaffold for general\nrepairs. This quotation was for ‘£70,000 for a minimum period of 6 week/s or less and at\na rental of £5,500.00 per week or part of a week after the expiration of that period.’\n16\n\nIn view of the work undertaken, Ms Cox concluded that Park West will not require\nredecoration for ‘at least 5 more years’, and, further, the investigative and planning work\nwould not need to be repeated when Park West next requires redecoration.\n55 In his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal stated that a saving had been made\nwith respect to the pre-commencement management costs and referred to Exhibit 4\n(Budget vs Actual Paid) (‘Exhibit 4’) to that statement which shows that the saving\namounts to £8,650.18 (including VAT) as at 12 April 2018.\n56 Ms Cox submitted that it was wholly reasonable for Park West RTM to make the decision\nto expend the disputed sums in order to ensure that the works were ‘economical and\ncarried out as well as possible’ and that the sums were reasonable within the context of\nthe ‘unusual one-off’ nature of the planning required for the works.\n(ii) Project Management – Site Period\n57 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders outlined the activities that were stated by W & A to\nbe within the remit of project management during the site period. She stated that these\nincluded liaising with sub-contractors, suppliers and the CDM-C co-ordinator, producing\ndocumentation and monitoring the progress of the works, liaising with architects and\ncontractors, continued programming of works, daily site visits by the project manager,\nand cost control by a quantity surveyor. In addition, she pointed out that provision was\nmade for ‘all other administration costs required to complete the works’. Ms Saunders\nsubmitted that this description of the work to be carried out by way of project\nmanagement during the site period appeared to be a ‘catch-all list of tasks that anyone\ncould perform in major works and is not bespoke to what was actually required for this\nspecific project’. In her opinion, there was no need to employ a quantity surveyor to cost\ncontrol the work as it progressed or to liaise with suppliers and architects – these works\nwere without any ‘unusualness’. Ms Saunders also queried whether the charges which\nhad been agreed between Park West RTM and W & A satisfied the RICS Code of Practice\n(‘RICS Code’) to the extent that the contract between these parties did not provide, as\nenvisaged by the RICS Code, for a menu of charges for duties outside the scope of an\nannual fee.\n58 In respect of the fees charged for project managing these works, Ms Saunders suggested\nthat it is incumbent on the Tribunal to carefully consider ‘the constituent parts of the\ntotal fee (added to the cost of the works) in respect of what services were actually\nsupplied, who carried them out and whether the rate charged fell within the range of\nnormal market rates’ and relied upon the decision of the Upper Tribunal in London\nBorough of Lewisham v Luis Rey-Ordieres [2013] UKUT 14 (LC)). She submitted that a\n36% fee is well outside normal market rates for works of a ‘pretty standard nature’; a\nfigure of 0-10% would be more reasonable and in line with industry norms. At the\nHearing on 24 April 2018, Mr Healey, with the permission of the Tribunal, presented an\ne-mail sent to him on 24 April 2018 at his request by Thomas Hopson MA MRICS,\nAssociate Director, Encore Estate Management, Nottingham which set out, inter alia, the\nmanagement fees charged on a typical section 20 consultation project by four chartered\nbuilding surveying firms with whom Encore Estate Management had dealt. This showed a\npercentage range between 9.5% and 15% plus VAT, and, pertinently, for work value\nbetween £70,000.00 and £99,999.00, which encompassed all stages of a section 20\nconsultation project, that a 10% plus VAT project management fee was charged.\n59 In her skeleton argument, Ms Cox explained that the sums expended during the site\nperiod were required to ensure that the works were carried out properly and safely with\nthe result that Park West RTM was protected from the risk of poor workmanship and\nfrom adverse claims by contractors. This was usual practice, and, therefore, Ms Cox\n17\n\nsubmitted that it was perfectly reasonable to employ managers to oversee works carried\nout by contractors.\n60 Ms Cox also pointed out that evidence adduced by Park West RTM showed that W & A\nspent 73 hours in 2017 on work related to Park West, although, as intimated in its\nstatement of case, much work was carried out which was not recorded. She averred that\nthe failure of Building Transformation to carry out the works to the required standard\nobliged W & A to spend significant time ensuring that Building Transformation returned\nto Park West with a view to rectifying those matters which were unsatisfactory. In the\nevent, Ms Cox indicated that corrective work undertaken by Building Transformation was\nnot done to the satisfaction of W & A with the result that W & A took steps to ensure that\nthe works were completed to a reasonable standard.\n61 In relation to Ms Saunders’ contention that the sums expended were beyond market rates\nand that the market rate is 0-10%, Ms Cox stated that no evidence had been provided by\nMs Saunders in support of that contention, other than the e-mail from Tom Hopson of\nEncore State Management, Nottingham to Mr Healey dated 24 April 2018 to which Ms\nCox submitted little, if any, evidential weight should be given, because it was not\nindependent and, simply, a generic statement. In this instance, Ms Cox stated that the\nfigure charged for supervision of the works was approximately 12% of the cost of carrying\nout the works. She submitted that this is the market rate for the supervision of such\nworks and that, therefore, the amount charged is a reasonable figure.\n62 At the Hearing, Mr Healey described the 2016 agreement as a ‘unique arrangement’. He\nquestioned Mr Temporal about the charging arrangements for management fees under\nthat agreement and about the differences between those arrangements and the RICS\nCode and, also, how they differed to the benefit of W & A from the terms of an agreement\nnegotiated between Park West RTM and W & A in 2010, which had been adduced in\nevidence by Park West RTM. Mr Healey suggested that the charging arrangements in the\n2016 agreement were not in accordance with normal practice which, usually, allowed for\na fixed fee followed, thereafter, by a menu of charges. Mr Healey submitted that it was\npossible under the 2016 agreement for W & A to charge on an ad hoc basis once the fees\ncharged had passed beyond the fixed fee threshold provided for in the agreement.\nConsequently, Mr Healey observed it was not possible to have an idea of likely\nprospective costs. Mr Healey also queried, in view of Mr Walton’s appointment as a\ndirector of Park West RTM and his position in W & A, whether the 2016 agreement was\nconducted at arm’s length.\nMr Temporal informed the Tribunal that W & A managed approximately 40 blocks of\napartments and estates. He added that each management agreement was negotiated by\nW & A with a view to meeting the needs of particular clients and that the precise terms of\nthose agreements depended on the outcome of the negotiations.\nIn Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal reported that\n£12,300.00 (including VAT) had been paid as at 12 April 2018.\n(iii) Additional specific costs\n63 As indicated above (see, paragraph 24), Ms Saunders also challenged certain specific costs\nwhich W & A claimed were payable in addition to the contractor’s costs and for supplying\nother services, namely an Architect’s fee (£750.00), the cost of providing health and\nwelfare facilities whilst the works were undertaken (£4,231.25) and the cost of appointing\na CDM-C co-ordinator (£1,250.00). In each instance, the costs cited were exclusive of\nVAT.\n18\n\n(i) Architect’s Fee\n64 Ms Saunders challenged the appointment of an Architect to carry out an inspection,\nproduce a report and recommend appropriate finishes to be applied to Park West. In her\nopinion, there was no need to appoint an Architect as Park West was not a listed building\nand the works did not involve any element of redesign. Ms Saunders submitted that the\ncost incurred (£750.00) was unreasonable, because it was unnecessary to employ an\nArchitect to ‘report on the finishes’.\n65 Ms Cox stated in her skeleton argument that this was a small sum of money which was\nrequired, first, in order to comply with the requirements of the local conservation area,\nand, secondly, because of the difficulty of finding an appropriate paint to coat the render.\nMs Cox referred to examples of other pertinent work carried out by the Architect, and to\nexplanations which had been given to leaseholders during the section 20 consultation\nabout the necessity for the Architect’s work both of which had been adduced in evidence.\nMs Cox explained that once it had been concluded that cleaning of the render was\ninsufficient, it was necessary to ascertain what finish could be applied and how well it\nwould last in order to avoid further costs in the future. She also pointed out that the\nconsequent inexpensive outgoing in obtaining this information was intended to save\nfuture costs by providing a lasting finish, and added that such an exercise would not need\nto be repeated when Park West is next decorated.\nMs Cox asserted that Ms Saunders had failed to provide any evidence to suggest that the\ninformation gleaned from the Architect’s work could have been obtained more cheaply\nelsewhere, or that such work was inherently unreasonable. Ms Cox submitted that this\ncost was reasonably incurred and was reasonable in amount.\nAt the Hearing, Mr Healey reiterated Ms Saunders’ challenge to the appointment of an\nArchitect to carry out the specified tasks. In his oral evidence to the Tribunal, Mr\nTemporal elaborated upon the Architect’s role and pointed out, as had been explained by\nMs Cox, that, in particular, the Architect had been involved, with Mr Stevenson, W & A’s\nConstruction and Maintenance Director, in the determination that cleaning of the render\nwas insufficient, the resolution after investigative work of which paint was to be used on\nthe render, and, further, with the provision of advice about a third quotation which had\nbeen received for the works and which, in view of its cost, was not pursued.\nIn Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal reported that £972.00\n(including VAT) had been paid as at 12 April 2018.\n(ii) Health and Welfare facilities\n66 In furtherance of the question raised in her Application about the reasonableness of the\nsum expended for the provision of a secure welfare unit during the currency of the works,\nMs Saunders in her statement of case queried the legislative basis upon which the\nexpenditure incurred in providing the welfare facility, £4,231.25, could be justified\nbearing in mind the nature of the works undertaken. Further, Ms Saunders stated she\nhad spoken to other owners and that no welfare unit(s) had been seen by them during the\nworks. In her oral evidence during the Hearing, Ms Saunders said that she had driven\npast Park West, frequently, during the carrying out of the works, but she had not seen a\nwelfare unit in the vicinity of Elliott Street as provided for in the description of the works.\nMs Saunders requested Park West RTM to provide evidence of the expenditure incurred\nin providing the welfare unit and asserted that the costs incurred were too high. In her\nopinion, Park West RTM should have obtained at least one other quote. At the Hearing,\nMr Healey suggested to the Tribunal that, in his experience, the cost of providing this\nfacility should have been £2,000.00 (plus VAT).\n19\n\n67 Ms Cox informed the Tribunal that the provision of the welfare facilities was explained in\nthe third notice that had been served on leaseholders in fulfilment of the section 20\nconsultation requirements which had notified leaseholders that the contract for the works\nhad been awarded to Building Transformation; an explanation which indicated that the\nwelfare facilities would be provided by W & A in view of their liability for health and\nwelfare on the site during the works. Ms Cox also explained that the facilities were\nrequired in order to satisfy Regulation 13(3)(c) of and Schedule 2 to the Construction\n(Design and Management) Regulations 2015. Moreover, as stated in Park West’s\nstatement of case, the welfare facilities were situated in Elliott Street and adjacent to Park\nWest during the works. Ms Cox referred the Tribunal to an invoice dated 2 November\n2016 in which the welfare facilities were described submitted to Park West RTM by W &\nA.\n68 Mr Temporal presented a colour photograph taken from Google Maps and dated\nSeptember 2016, which showed several welfare units in the designated area in Elliott\nStreet, as Exhibit 11 to his supplemental witness statement.\n69 In these circumstances, Ms Cox stated that Park West RTM refuted the unsupported\nassertion that no welfare unit had been in place in Elliott Street and adjacent to Park\nWest. Similarly, Ms Cox rejected the suggestion by Ms Saunders that the cost of providing\nthis facility was ‘too high’ and that another quote should have been sought. In this\nrespect, Ms Cox observed that Ms Saunders had failed to provide any quote upon which\nthe Tribunal might rely in order to consider whether the cost incurred was too high.\nFurther, Ms Cox submitted that since the works were scheduled to take between 8 and 9\nweeks (whereas, as Mr Temporal had shown in his evidence, they in fact took longer) the\nsum disputed by Ms Saunders amounts to just over £500.00 per week, which is a\nreasonable figure for the provision of such facilities.\n70 In Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal reported that\n£5,332.50 (including VAT) had been paid as at 12 April 2018.\n(iii) CDM-C co-ordinator\n71 In her witness statement, Ms Saunders stated that she had queried why a CDM-C co-\nordinator was required for ‘this small job as I thought the cost was unnecessary’. Further,\nMs Saunders intimated that during the section 20 consultation process, another\nleaseholder had questioned whether there was a legal obligation to appoint a CDM-C co-\nordinator for the works in that the works were not notifiable to the Health and Safety\nExecutive (HSE) and in light of the CDM Regulations 2015, which came into force on 6\nApril 2015, and which do not include a role entitled CDM-C co-ordinator. Further, Ms\nSaunders was not satisfied with the response from W & A to this question which, first,\naccepted that, although there was no requirement to appoint a CDM-C co-ordinator in\nthe sense that the works were not notifiable to the HSE, advice from a CDM-C co-\nordinator was still needed to comply with all health and safety issues, and, secondly,\nacknowledged the change introduced by the CDM Regulations 2015 and added ‘because\nof this we instructed the services of our approved CDM-C person before this change took\nplace and they can act on our behalf until October 2015…there will still be a role for\nCDM-C after that date but they would have to be employed by the Client or form part of\nthe Architect’s role.’\n72 Additionally, in her statement of case, Ms Saunders alluded to the costs of W & A in\nmanaging the works during the pre-commencement and site periods. This management\nincluded the use of a project manager, a quantity surveyor, a planner/programmer, and\nother administrative staff who, Ms Saunders suggested, might ‘undertake a risk\nassessment and then manage that assessment throughout the entirety of the works’ which\n20\n\nwould render the appointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator unnecessary. Ms Saunders\nrequired Park West RTM to provide documentary evidence of the appointment of the\nCDM-C co-ordinator for the works and strict proof of expenditure incurred.\n73 In these circumstances, Ms Saunders asserted that the charge made in respect of the\nappointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator was an unreasonable cost. It was a duplication of\nthe fees levied by W & A to manage the works which, Ms Saunders contended, covered\nhealth and safety matters.\n74 Ms Cox indicated that, as with the provision of the welfare facilities, the appointment of a\nCDM-C co-ordinator was explained in the third notice that had been served on\nleaseholders in fulfilment of the section 20 consultation requirements. Further, Ms Cox\nexplained that the employment of the expert services of an external CDM-C co-ordinator,\nBCA Project Services, was prompted by W & A’s liability for health and welfare on the site\nand with a view, broadly, to advising W & A on any issues arising on site during the works\nand in order to ensure that W & A were working correctly and in line with HSE\nguidelines. She added that it was necessary to pay particular attention to health and\nsafety requirements because, in order to save significant costs, it had been decided to\nadopt a more dangerous methodology for carrying out the works i.e. working by abseiling\nrather than from scaffolding. Ms Cox also highlighted that BCA Project Services prepared\na schedule of services relating to its role as the CDM-C co-ordinator under the CDM\nRegulations 2007 and, thereafter, wrote a pre-construction report dated September 2016\ncontaining health and safety information relating to the redecoration of the external\nelevations of Park West. In its statement of case, Park West RTM submitted that the costs\nso incurred, £1,250.00, were reasonably incurred and that the resultant value gained by\nMs Saunders was clearly identifiable.\n75 At the Hearing, Mr Healey stated that there was no formal requirement to appoint a\nCDM-C co-ordinator and, consequently, the Tribunal should not entertain the costs of\n£1,250.00 in relation to that appointment. He added that the pre-construction report\nserved no purpose as it was not specific to Park West and could be used for any project.\nIn his oral evidence, Mr Temporal indicated that, as Ms Cox had explained, the manner\nin which the works were carried out i.e. through abseiling necessarily involved significant\nattention to health and safety. He stated that the CDM-C co-ordinator was needed to\nassess and to advise upon those risks and that the appointment had been made in the\nbest interests of the leaseholders. Further, in Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness\nstatement, Mr Temporal reported that £750.00 (including VAT) had been paid as at 12\nApril 2018.\nDispute 2\n76 The following paragraphs (77-83) summarise the submissions of the parties relating to\nissues concerning the works undertaken and the standard of those works.\nThe Works – reasonable standard\n77 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders made a number of statements about the works,\nnamely that those works were stopped half way through, had not been completed and\nwere not of a reasonable standard. She stated that prior to the Application and over a\nlengthy period of time, she had sought and been unable to ascertain from W & A and/or\ntheir solicitors information about why the works had apparently stopped, save that a\nletter from W & A which accompanied the March 2017 service charge demand indicated\nthat there were ‘concerns about the standard of work’ and that a sum of £10,000.00 was\nrequired to cover legal action against Building Transformation. In these circumstances,\nMs Saunders felt it was necessary for Park West RTM to ‘fully explain’ the exact nature of\nthe dispute between itself and Building Transformation (together with the status of any\n21\n\nlitigation) and with regard to the works to indicate whether plans were in place to\ncomplete the works and when, how much has been spent and if any consultation is to be\nundertaken with a view to the completion of the works.\n78 For Park West RTM, Ms Cox stated that prior to 2016 Park West had not been\nredecorated since it was developed in 2003; a statement which was endorsed by Mr\nTemporal. Further, Ms Cox indicated that the external render and window frames had\nbeen dirty and in need of decoration and minor repair, and it did not appear that Ms\nSaunders disputed that the works were necessary.\n79 In its statement of case, Park West RTM ‘advised’ Ms Saunders that Building\nTransformation ‘did not carry out the works to the reasonable satisfaction of the\nRespondent. The Respondent’s managing agent carried out a considerable amount of\nwork in making suitable representations to Building Transformation who did return to\nthe development on numerous occasions in order to remedy the works. Ultimately, the\nRespondent’s managing agent stepped in to complete the final aspects of the works.’\nConsequently, Ms Cox stated that Ms Saunders’ submission that the works had not been\ncompleted was misconceived and that the works were completed on or around 25 July\n2017 – the final element of those works related to the timber cladding in the courtyard of\nPark West. In his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal recorded that Pamela\nBrangan, a Director of Park West RTM, had signed off the works by telephone.\nIn his evidence, Mr Temporal also explained that the dissatisfaction with the quality of\nwork undertaken by Building Transformation and the ensuing dispute between Park\nWest RTM and Building Transformation led Park West RTM to instruct solicitors,\nFreeths LLP, a firm which he believed specialised in construction law, to seek legal\nredress against Building Transformation. Mr Temporal informed the Tribunal that, in the\ncourse of the dispute, Building Transformation commissioned an expert report on the\nstandard of its workmanship at Park West which was written by Bidwells LLP and was\ndated 26 April 2017. Mr Temporal appended this report to his supplemental witness\nstatement as Exhibit 13. Mr Temporal indicated that whilst this report was not accepted\nin its entirety by Park West RTM it was instrumental in settling the dispute between the\nparties. He described the manner in which the dispute was resolved as follows:\n‘…a settlement agreement had been entered into whereby Building Transformations\nwould carry out further restorative works in return for their outstanding fees. As it\nbecame clear to the Respondent that these restorative works would not be completed to\nthe reasonable satisfaction of the Respondent, Building Transformations were excused\nfrom their responsibilities under the settlement agreement in return for a lower fee.’\nMr Temporal also appended a number of photographs in various exhibits (6–9) to his\nsupplemental witness statement which showed, respectively, the exterior of Park West\nprior to the commencement of the works, signs of the issues that were becoming\napparent with regard to the quality of the works carried out by Building Transformation\n(taken on 25 October 2016), evidence of the snagging process and, hence, evidence of the\nquality of the work undertaken (taken on 4 November 2016, 8 November 2016 and 14\nNovember 2016) and the two final sessions of snagging (taken on 20 February 2017 and 1\nMarch 2017). He was uncertain of the exact date upon which Building Transformation\nceased working at Park West, but, as he had intimated, the last snagging session had been\non 1 March 2017.\nIn Exhibit 4 to his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal reported that the\nbudgeted contractor cost of the works (£81,254.69 + VAT) for Park West was reduced by\n£24,003.75 (including VAT) as a result of the resolution of the dispute with Building\nTransformation relating to the standard of the works. He also informed the Tribunal that\nthe legal costs referred to by Ms Saunders in her statement of case comprised the legal\n22\n\nfees payable by Park West RTM to Freeths LLP for legal services rendered in relation to\nthis dispute and added that there were associated costs incurred by W & A. These fees\nand costs were referred to in Exhibit 4 and comprised £11,998.72 (including VAT) and\n£23,650.00 (including VAT) respectively as at 12 April 2018.\n80 In his supplemental witness statement, Mr Temporal also informed the Tribunal that the\nfollowing adjustments had been made to the budgeted costs of the works – an additional\ncost of £1,622.28 (plus VAT; £1,946.74) for a gutter safe system, and deductions of\n£600.00 (plus VAT; £720.00) and £375.00 (plus VAT; £450.00) for the area not painted\non the Hermon Street elevation of Park West and for cleaning paint off an Audi car\nrespectively.\n81 Further, Mr Temporal referred the Tribunal to an independent building survey relating to\nthe condition and state of repair of Park West which had been commissioned by W & A\nfollowing the completion of the works. Mr Temporal indicated that this report which was\nwritten by Cloud Surveyors and dated 1 February 2018 was appended to his initial\nwitness statement. Mr Temporal said that the forward maintenance plan for Park West\ncontained in Appendix 1 of the report and covering the period 2018-2022 showed that\nonly £300.00 had been allowed for external redecoration of Park West over that 5 year\nperiod. From this, Mr Temporal stated in his initial witness statement that it was\nreasonable to assume that the works had been completed to a reasonable standard\nalthough it was accepted that some paint splashes remained. However, Mr Temporal\npointed out that Cloud Surveyors had ‘highlighted to the Respondent that if you wanted\nto clean all the paint splashes off you would need to erect scaffolding which would not be\na viable option or a good use of the service charge.’\n82 Ms Cox submitted that the works had been completed properly and to a reasonable\nstandard and that the complaint about the works made by Ms Saunders was without\nfoundation or proper explanation. Ms Cox noted that Ms Saunders is not personally\nresident at Park West and suggested that it was not apparent from Ms Saunders’ evidence\nthat she had actually seen the works at any time. Moreover, Ms Cox observed that Ms\nSaunders had not submitted any independent evidence as to the standard of the works or\nany proposal as to the amount that she would consider appropriate to pay for the work\nwhich has been done.\n83 At the Hearing, Mr Healey said that there were doubts about whether the render should\nhave been painted, but, assuming that painting was an appropriate option, the\nspecification for the works was defective. In his opinion, two coats of paint were\ninadequate to achieve the required standard which was borne out in the report written by\nBidwells LLP that also questioned the use of abseiling to carry out the painting. As to the\nstandard of the work undertaken, Mr Healey made the following points. First, the poor\nstandard of the work undertaken was evident on inspection. Secondly, no preparatory\nworks were undertaken and the paint had apparently been applied to the external render\nof Park West in a random and uneven manner leaving an unsatisfactory outcome which\nwas particularly evident from the different coats of paints which had been applied to the\nIlkeston Road elevation of Park West leaving different shaded strips. Thirdly, there were\nalso many paint splashes remaining of which the splashes on Ms Babadi’s balcony, which\nwere observed by the Tribunal during its inspection, by way of example.\nMr Healey also questioned the involvement of W & A in carrying out remedial work on\nsite with a view to rectifying perceived defects in Building Transformation’s work. In his\nopinion, such work did not fall within their remit of managing the works during the site\nperiod.\n23\n\n2002 Act application\n84 In her statement of case, Ms Saunders objected to two charges, each of £6o.00, which\nhad been included in her service charge account in 2017. In that account, these were\ndescribed as ‘late payment admin fees’. Ms Saunders argued that these fees were unfair\nbecause they were levied at a time when she was awaiting a response from W & A and\ntheir solicitors as to complaints which she had made in relation to the section 20\nconsultation.\n85 Ms Cox made a number of points in response to this objection. First, the only ‘late\npayment’ fees which had been imposed were not applied in the service charge year (April\n2016 – March 2017) which was in issue within the Application. In fact, the first of these\nfees was included in Ms Saunders’ statement of account in June 2017. Consequently, they\nwere not relevant to these proceedings. Secondly, the sums in dispute between the parties\namount to only £1,872.69. However, it is clear from her statement of account that Ms\nSaunders also has significant further arrears in relation to which she has made no express\ncomplaint. In this respect, Ms Cox averred that even if Ms Saunders is entitled to\nwithhold payment of the sums subject to the dispute, she is not entitled to withhold sums\nin relation to which she has no proper objection. This adversely affects other leaseholders\nand Park West RTM whose only source of income is the service charge. Thirdly, Ms\nSaunders is obliged to pay such fees in accordance with clause 3.1 and paragraph 2(b) of\nthe Third Schedule to the lease (see, paragraph 18) and the wording on service charge\ndemands sent to Ms Saunders indicates that such sums may be charged. Finally, the fee\ncharged must be reasonable. Ms Cox opined that this test is satisfied when account is\ntaken of the costs incurred in pursuing late payments and the knock-on effects for other\nleaseholders. Ms Cox also observed that the sum charged is small in comparison to the\namounts owed by Ms Saunders in service charge arrears.\nSection 20C application\n86 Mr Healey indicated that Ms Saunders had been prompted to make her application to the\nTribunal for an order under section 20C, primarily, because over a lengthy period of time,\nexceeding 12 months, she had been unable to secure information from either W & A or\ntheir solicitors (to whom she had been directed) about, in particular, various aspects of\nthe works, for example, why the works had stopped, and the dispute relating to those\nworks and its related costs. Mr Healey said that this lack of communication was\nevidenced in November 2017 when Ms Saunders was informed by the solicitors that ‘we\nare unable to get a meaningful response from our client, so we have cancelled our legal\nfees charged to you and closed the case’. Mr Healey added that Ms Saunders also believed\nthat it was only right that the (unexplained) high project management fees be challenged.\nHe submitted that, in these circumstances, it was not just and equitable that the costs\nincurred by Park West RTM in connection with the proceedings before the Tribunal\nshould fall to be paid by leaseholders through the service charge. Similarly, it was not just\nand equitable, in his opinion, for costs incurred by Park West RTM in connection with\nthe dispensation application, which ‘was not inevitable or absolutely necessary and to\nprotect the landlord’s position’ and, in the event, was not resisted by Ms Saunders, to be\nborne by leaseholders through the service charge (see also, paragraph 50).\n87 Ms Saunders’ Application was described in various ways by Park West RTM and its\nrepresentatives. In its statement of case, Park West RTM considered that the Application\nhad been completed in a scattergun manner. Ms Cox, in her skeleton argument and\nduring the Hearing, referred to the Application as ‘vague and ill-founded’ and ‘nebulous\nand non-specific’ and one in respect of which Park West RTM had been obliged to spend\nmonies. Further, Ms Cox added that Ms Saunders’ complaints about lack of information\nhad been met by the content of the Hearing bundle submitted on behalf of Park West\nRTM, and, consequently, in Ms Cox’s opinion, these proceedings need not have been\n24\n\npursued. Ms Cox observed that Ms Saunders’ only apparent objection to the costs of the\nproceedings being recovered, if necessary, through the service charge was that she did not\nwish the leaseholders to pay them. However, Ms Cox stated that the leaseholders will\nhave to pay in any event as Park West RTM is an RTM company with the prospect, in the\nabsence of recovery, that it will be insolvent. In the circumstances and bearing in mind\nthat Ms Saunders brought matters before the Tribunal without any proper evidence,\nespecially evidence as to ‘reasonableness’, Ms Cox submitted that it would be\ninappropriate to deprive Park West RTM of its contractual right to recover its costs in\nrelation to these proceedings through the service charge provisions in the lease.\nIn reply to Ms Saunders’ response to the dispensation application, Mr Wayman\nconsidered it to be wholly unreasonable to put Park West RTM to the cost of making that\napplication only for Ms Saunders to confirm in her written representations in response to\nthat application that it would not be resisted. Moreover, Mr Wayman asserted that it was\nan application, which on the basis of the initial evidence given by Ms Saunders that she\nwas not prejudiced by the section 20 notices being ‘short’ and the evidence available to\nMs Saunders on the second day of the Hearing, should ‘at the very least have been\nconsented to’ by Ms Saunders. In these circumstances, Mr Wayman stated that there\nwere no grounds for Ms Saunders’ submission that Park West RTM’s costs associated\nwith making the dispensation application should not be recovered from the leaseholders\nthrough the service charge regime (see also, paragraph 51).\nIn this reply and on the advice of Ms Cox, Mr Wayman also drew the Tribunal’s attention\nto a ‘serious matter’ of which he was informed immediately following Day 2 of the\nHearing and which he regarded as germane to Ms Saunders’ section 20C application,\nnamely an e-mail which Mr Healey had written directly to Pamela Brangan on the eve of\nDay 2 of the Hearing. At this time, Mr Wayman stated that there was no reason for Mr\nHealey to believe that LMP Law Limited was no longer acting for Park West RTM.\nConsequently, Mr Wayman contended that if Mr Healey wished to address any question\nwhatsoever to Park West RTM he should have directed that question to LMP Law\nLimited. Mr Wayman added that had LMP Law Limited been aware of this ‘serious\ntransgression’ before Day 2 of the Hearing Ms Cox would have referred to it as part of her\nsubmissions concerning the section 20C application.\nDetermination\nIntroduction\n88 In making its determination, the Tribunal considered, carefully, the oral and written\nevidence presented by the parties.\n89 The issues raised in the Application are considered and determined in the order in which\nthe evidence submitted by the parties has been presented in this decision, namely the\nsection 27A application, the 2002 Act application and the section 20C application. With\nregard to the former, the Tribunal, in the absence of a case being made by Ms Saunders in\nher written or oral evidence upon which the Tribunal might make a finding, makes no\ndetermination in relation to questions c. and d. in the Application (see, paragraph 24).\nFurther, the Tribunal makes no finding as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the legal\nfees incurred in connection with the settlement of the dispute with Building\nTransformation. In this respect, whilst the Tribunal acknowledges that these legal fees\nwere one of the catalysts for the Application and that, at the request of Ms Saunders in\nher statement of case, information pertaining to those costs was provided at the Hearing,\nit considers that neither of these factors brings those costs within the remit of the present\nApplication. It follows that the Tribunal also makes no finding as to the related costs of W\n& A.\n25\n\nSection 27A application\nSection 20 consultation\n90 The essence and purpose of a section 20 consultation is encompassed in the following\nwords of Lord Justice Lewison in The London Borough of Hounslow v Waaler [2017]\nEWCA Civ 45 (‘Waaler’):\n“ [38]…before carrying out works of any size the landlord is obliged to comply with\nconsultation requirements; and the current requirements are those contained in the\nService Charges (Consultation Requirements) (England) Regulations 2003. The landlord\nmust…describe the works proposed to be carried out, and under each of the Schedules to\nthose regulations the landlord must “have regard” to the lessees’ observations on his\nproposals. The obligation to consult goes to the appropriateness of the works proposed by\nthe landlord: Daejan at [43]. Although the duty to consult in this context is not a public\nlaw duty imposed on the landlord (see Daejan at [52]) nevertheless the concept of what\namounts to consultation is well developed in public law (see for example R v North and\nEst Devon Health Authority, ex p Coughlan [2001] QB 213). What this means is that the\nlandlord must conscientiously consider the lessees’ observations and give them due\nweight, depending on the nature and cogency of the observations. In the light of this\nstatutory obligation to consult, it is impossible to say that the tenants’ views are ever\nimmaterial. They will have to be considered in every case. This does not of course mean\nthe lessees have any kind of veto over what the landlord does; nor that they are entitled to\ninsist upon the cheapest possible means of fulfilling the landlord’s objective. But a duty to\nconsult and to “have regard” to the lessees’ observations entails more than simply telling\nthem what is going to happen. Given that in every case the tenants will have had the\nopportunity to make observations on the landlord’s proposals I do not consider that the\nlandlord has any further positive duty to inquire into the tenants’ views. The statutory\nconsultation process is designed to inform the landlord about the tenants’ views.\n[39] Once the landlord has consulted the tenants and taken their observations into\naccount, it is then for the landlord to make the final decision. In considering whether the\nfinal decision is a reasonable one, the tribunal must accord the landlord what, in other\ncontexts, is described as a “margin of appreciation”. As I have said there may be a\nnumber of outcomes, each of which is reasonable, and it is for the landlord to choose\nbetween them.”\n91 Should it be contended that the consultation requirements have been breached, an\napplication for dispensation under section 20ZA of the 1985 Act may be made. The\nproper approach for the Tribunal to take when considering such an application is set out\nin the Supreme Court’s judgment in Daejan. In summary, the approach to be adopted is\nas follows:\na. The Tribunal should identify the extent to which tenants would be prejudiced in\neither paying for inappropriate works or paying more than would be appropriate\nas a result of the failure by the landlord to comply with the consultation\nrequirements;\nb. That no distinction should be drawn between ‘a serious failure’ and ‘technical\nerror or minor or excusable oversight’ on the landlord’s part save in relation to the\nprejudice it causes;\nc. The financial consequences to the landlord of not granting a dispensation are not\nrelevant factors when the Tribunal is considering how to exercise its jurisdiction\nunder section 20ZA; and\n26\n\nd. The nature of the landlord is not relevant.\n92 In the light of this guidance from the Supreme Court, the primary question for the\nTribunal is to consider whether there is real prejudice to the tenant arising from a\nlandlord’s breach of the consultation requirements. In this respect, there is a factual\nburden on the tenant to identify some prejudice, which is financial, that would or might\nhave been suffered as a result of the landlord’s failure to properly consult.\n93 The Tribunal may grant dispensation on such terms and subject to such conditions as it\nthinks fit, but any such terms and conditions must be appropriate in their nature and\neffect.\n94 Ms Saunders raised two issues in relation to the manner in which the section 20\nconsultation was conducted, namely the service of the section 20 notices which she\nsubmitted did not comply with the requirement to allow a 30 day consultation period and\nthe failure by W & A to include in its written response to matters raised by leaseholders\nduring the consultation the observations which she said that she had made in a letter sent\nby post pursuant to the second section 20 notice and within the designated consultation\nperiod. In respect of each of these issues, the evidence presented to the Tribunal by the\nparties was conflicting and, to a degree, incomplete. As to the ‘short notices’, Ms\nSaunders stated, particularly, that the notices in respect of which a leaseholder response\ncould be made arrived on days that fell within the required 30 day consultation period\nwithin which such responses might be submitted. This was denied by Park West RTM\nalthough no evidence was adduced as to proof of posting of the notices, for example, a\ncertificate of posting. Nevertheless, Mr Temporal in his evidence made it clear that,\nregardless of the length of the consultation period, submissions made by leaseholders\nthat were received after the closing date of that period were considered. Similarly,\ndisparities were evident in the positions taken by the parties with regard to the letter\nwhich Ms Saunders stated that she had sent to W & A in response to the second section\n20 notice. In this respect, Ms Saunders relied upon her recollection of the contents of her\nletter as she had not retained a copy of it. Park West RTM denied that this letter had been\nreceived and, consequently, it had not been possible to acknowledge it in W & A’s written\ncomments about matters raised by leaseholders. However, it pointed out that the matters\nwhich Ms Saunders said that she had included in her letter had been raised by other\nleaseholders and these were covered in W & A’s written comments on those matters.\nIn addition to the contrasting stances adopted by the parties on these issues, there was\nalso what might be described as a certain ambiguity in Ms Saunders’ evidence in that,\nwhilst raising these issues in her written evidence and persisting with them in her oral\nevidence on Day 1 of the Hearing, she accepted that she had not suffered any prejudice,\nmost explicitly in relation to the ‘short notices’. This persistence would appear to have\nprompted Park West RTM to make its formal dispensation application which, in due\ncourse, Ms Saunders did not resist.\nIn these circumstances, it is difficult for the Tribunal to make conclusive findings on\neither of the issues raised by Ms Saunders in relation to the propriety or otherwise of the\nsection 20 consultation. Although, the Tribunal notes, in passing, that it would appear\nthat W & A dealt diligently with those leaseholders’ observations covered by its written\ncomments and that these comments addressed matters which Ms Saunders believes that\nshe raised in her letter.\nHowever, it is also fair to say that even if Ms Saunders’ representations as to what she\nperceived as flaws in that consultation are conceivable her admissions that she did not\nsuffer any consequent prejudice, a conclusion with which assuming the existence of such\n27\n\nflaws the Tribunal would have no reason to disagree, made her ultimate decision not to\nresist the dispensation application a matter of little doubt.\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines, in so far as it can, that, in the absence of prejudice,\ndispensation as specified in the dispensation application from the consultation\nrequirements of section 20 would be in order.\nThe Tribunal returns to the dispensation application in the context of the section 20C\napplication in paragraph 119 of this decision.\n95 On the assumption that the section 20 consultation is treated as completed for the\npurposes of this Application, the Tribunal makes the following findings in respect of the\nsubstantive issues raised in the section 27A application.\nThe payability and reasonableness of service charges\n96 The above cited sections 18, 19 and 27A of the 1985 Act (see, paragraphs 33-34) contain\nimportant statutory provisions relating to the recovery of service charges in residential\nleases. In the ordinary course of events, payment of these charges is governed by the\nterms of the lease which set out the agreement that has been entered into by the parties\nto the lease. However, these provisions in the 1985 Act provide additional protection to\ntenants in this instance, broadly, through the application of a test of ‘reasonableness’.\n97 In these respects, the construction of a lease is a matter of law whereas the\n‘reasonableness’ of the service charge for the purposes of the 1985 Act is a matter of fact.\nIt is accepted that there is no presumption either way in deciding the ‘reasonableness’ of\na service charge. If a tenant provides evidence which establishes a prima facie case for a\nchallenge, the onus is on the landlord to counter that evidence. Consequently, a decision\nis reached on the strength of the arguments made by the parties. Essentially, the Tribunal\ndecides ‘reasonableness’ on the evidence which has been presented to it (Yorkbrook\nInvestments Ltd v Batten [1985] 2 EGLR 100).\n98 With regard to the test of establishing whether a cost was reasonably incurred, the usual\nstarting point, and one that was adopted by Ms Cox, is the Lands Tribunal decision in\nForcelux Limited v Sweetman [2001] 2 EGLR 173 (‘Forcelux’), which concerned the\nrecovery of insurance premiums through a service charge, in which Mr PR Francis FRICS\nsaid:\n“[39]…The question I have to answer is not whether the expenditure for any particular\nservice charge item was necessarily the cheapest available, but whether the charge that\nwas made was reasonably incurred.\n[40] But to answer that question, there are in my judgment, two distinctly separate\nmatters I have to consider. First, the evidence, and from that whether the landlord’s\nactions were appropriate and properly effected in accordance with the requirements of\nthe lease, the RICS Code and the 1985 Act. Second, whether the amount charged was\nreasonable in light of that evidence. This second point is particularly important as, if that\ndid not have to be considered, it would be open to any landlord to plead justification for\nany particular figure, on the grounds that the steps it took justified the expense, without\nproperly testing the market.”\n99 Subsequently, in the Lands Tribunal decision in Veena v Cheong [2003] 1 EGLR 175, Mr\nPH Clarke FRICS observed:\n28\n\n“[103]…The question is not solely whether costs are ‘reasonable’ but whether they are\n‘reasonably incurred’, that is to say whether the action taken in incurring the costs and\nthe amount of those costs were both reasonable.”\n100 Recently, the Court of Appeal analysed the concept of ‘reasonably incurred’ in section\n19(1) of the 1985 Act in Waaler in the course of considering whether the cost of replacing\nwindows by Hounslow was reasonable where those windows could have been repaired at\na cost that was substantially less than the cost of replacing the windows. The court said\nthat in applying the test of establishing whether a cost was reasonably incurred the\nlandlord’s decision making process is not ‘the only touchstone’. A landlord must do more\nthan act rationally in making decisions, otherwise section 19 would serve no useful\npurpose. It is particularly important that the outcome of the decision making process is\nconsidered. As HHJ Stuart Bridge said in the later Upper Tribunal decision in Cos\nServices Limited v Nicholson and Willans [2017] UKUT 382 (LC):\n“[47] If, in determining whether a cost has been ‘reasonably incurred’, a tribunal is\nrestricted to an examination of whether the landlord has acted rationally, section 19 will\nhave little or no impact for the reasons identified by the Court of Appeal in Waaler. I\nagree with the Court of Appeal that this cannot be the intention of Parliament when it\nenacted section 19 as it would add nothing to the protection of the tenant that existed\npreviously. It must follow that the tribunal is required to go beyond the issue of the\nrationality of the landlord’s decision-making and to consider in addition whether the sum\nbeing charged is, in all the circumstances, a reasonable charge. It is, as the Lands\nTribunal identified in Forcelux, necessarily a two-stage test.\n[48] Context is, as always, everything, and every decision will be based upon its own\nfacts…”\n101 In approaching the question of the ‘reasonableness’ of the contested costs within the\nservice charge in this Application, the Tribunal is also mindful of the Upper Tribunal\ndecision in Regent Management Limited v Jones [2010] UKUT 369 (LC) to which Ms\nCox also referred, and, in particular, to the following cautionary words of HHJ Mole QC:\n“[35] The test is whether the service charge that was made was a reasonable one; not\nwhether there are other possible ways of charging that might have been thought better or\nmore reasonable. There may be several different ways of dealing with a particular\nproblem… All of them may be perfectly reasonable. Each may have its own advantages\nand disadvantages. Some people may favour one set of advantages and disadvantages,\nothers another. The LVT may have its own view. If the choice had been left to the LVT, it\nmight not have chosen what the management company chose but that does not\nnecessarily make what the management company chose unreasonable.”\n102 In the light of this judicial guidance, the Tribunal’s discussion and findings in respect of\neach of the contested matters follows.\nManagement fees – surveying and project management\n103 At the outset, the Tribunal notes that each of the parties accepted that it was necessary to\nemploy professionals to undertake the project management and oversight of the works,\nalthough Ms Saunders expressed the following reservations about aspects of the\nfulfilment of this role by W & A. First, the 2016 agreement between Park West RTM and\nW & A was not negotiated at arm’s length bearing in mind the roles which Mr Walton\nplays in relation to Park West RTM and W & A respectively. Secondly, the 2016\nagreement differed materially from the earlier 2010 agreement entered into by Park West\nRTM and W & A to the benefit of W & A. Thirdly, the 2016 agreement did not follow the\n29\n\nguidance offered in the RICS Code relating to additional charges leading to the\nemployment of ad hoc charging.\n104 Further, it was also evident to the Tribunal that, whilst the evidence presented by Ms\nSaunders or on her behalf proceeded on the basis of a differentiation between the project\nmanagement fee relating to the pre-commencement of the works and the project\nmanagement fee covering the period during which the works were undertaken (the site\nperiod), her challenge was to the reasonableness of the totality of those fees. In essence,\nMs Saunders argued that the project management fee charged for the works did not\naccord with the ‘industry standard’ for this type of project which requires the application\nof a suitable percentage to the costs for the works in order to ascertain the fee that is\npayable. In this respect, as the evidence shows, various representations were made by Ms\nSaunders and Mr Healey about the range of percentages that may be apposite depending\non the cost of the works – Ms Saunders suggested between 0-10% in the Application\nwhilst Mr Healey favoured between 9.5-15% (with 10% applying in cases where the cost of\nthe works fell between £70,000.00 and £99,999.00) on the basis of information which\nhe had commissioned from a fellow surveyor; neither of which were commensurate with\nthe 36% management fee which Ms Saunders attributed to W & A in the Application. In\ncontrast, Ms Cox told the Tribunal that the management fee relating to the site period\nwas approximately 12% of the costs of the works and that this was the market rate for the\nsupervision of such works.\n105 With regard to the points raised in relation to the 2016 agreement, it is clear that,\ngenerally, parties to an agreement are able to agree the terms by which they wish to be\nbound and that there may be circumstances in which any relationship between the\nparties may influence the manner in which those terms are framed. However, it does not\nfollow that there is necessarily anything untoward in the latter circumstance and no\nevidence was presented to the Tribunal to show that the dual role of Mr Walton was\ninstrumental in the negotiation of the terms of the 2016 agreement including the\narrangements for payment of the management fee in relation to the works. Nevertheless,\nit similarly does not follow that the management fee payable in accordance with the 2016\nagreement can necessarily be accommodated within the service charge payable by the\nleaseholders of Park West. For this to happen, such management fee must satisfy the test\nof reasonableness in section 19 of the 1985 Act. In this respect, the Tribunal does not feel\nthat a comparison with comparable terms in the 2010 agreement, which was not\nimplemented, facilitates the resolution of the question whether the actual management\nfee payable under the 2016 agreement is deemed to be reasonable. Equally, it is not\nenough to say, as suggested by Mr Temporal, that the terms of a management agreement,\nincluding the terms relating to the charging of a management fee, are negotiated\nindividually with a client’s particular requirements in mind otherwise the need for section\n19 would be negated, which is not what Parliament could have intended.\nMore telling, perhaps, in the context of the 2016 agreement, is the substantive guidance\nprovided in that section of the current RICS Code relating to the appointment of\nmanaging agents wherein it is stated in clause 3.5 that terms of engagement should\ninclude a ‘menu’ of charges for duties falling outside the scope of the annual fee i.e.\nprovision for additional amounts to be charged outside of standard management issues.\nIn this respect, clause 3.5 also makes clear that ‘all charges should be proportionate to the\ntime and amount of work involved and any service or provision of information should be\ndelivered in a reasonable timeframe.’ In this regard, there is some strength in Mr\nHealey’s arguments pertaining to the reasonableness of the management fee that the\nframing of the charging structure in the 2016 agreement, which did not include a menu of\ncharges, made it difficult to anticipate the scale of the management costs associated with\nthe works and to obtain meaningful information from W & A about those costs and the\nworks.\n30\n\n106 In turn, this examination of the project management fee charged in accordance with the\ncharging framework in the 2016 agreement brings into sharp focus its compatibility or\notherwise with the ‘industry standard’ for this type of project management and, further,\nthe bearing this may have on its reasonableness or otherwise. However, in this respect,\nthe Tribunal does not find the variable opinions expressed by the parties, which were\nunsupported by credible or compelling evidence, as sufficiently indicative of that\n‘industry standard’ or of its application which, on the evidence, makes such a comparison\nproblematic.\n107 In the light of the above, the Tribunal finds that the determination of the reasonableness\nof the management fee charged under the 2016 agreement falls within the Tribunal’s\nknowledge and experience as an expert tribunal. In applying that knowledge and\nexperience, it determines that the total amount of the management fee relating to\nprofessional work for the section 20 works which may be regarded as reasonable within\nthe meaning of section 19 of the 1985 Act and for the purposes of this Application should\nnot exceed 12.5% plus VAT of the total net cost of the works.\nArchitect’s fee\n108 Ms Saunders challenged the appointment of an Architect in a role that did not require\nany element of redesign and which was for a purpose, which, principally, involved what\nshe described as a ‘report on finishes’. In her opinion, the role of the Architect was\nunnecessary and related to matters which were within the remit of the managing agents,\nW & A.\nThe precise role and function of the Architect is set out in the specification that was\nmade available to leaseholders during the section 20 consultation (see, paragraph 23)\nand evidence was adduced by Park West RTM, notably from Mr Temporal, which showed\nthat the architect had performed the advisory role which this appointment entailed and\nfulfilled the duties expected of him.\nThe Tribunal accepts that such a role and its related duties did not necessarily have to be\nperformed by an Architect.\nHowever, the Tribunal finds that it was prudent to seek out professional advice prior to\nthe commencement of the works on the matters referred to in the specification, especially\non the questions of whether the render should be painted and, if so, what type of paint\nshould be used, and rejects the notion that the resolution of these matters necessarily fell\nwithin the expertise of W & A. In this circumstance, the appointment of an Architect was\none of a number of reasonable ways in which this professional advice might have been\nobtained. Ms Saunders did not submit any evidence to suggest that the advice and\ninformation so acquired could have been obtained, otherwise, for a lesser fee.\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that the Architect’s fee was reasonably incurred\nand that it was reasonable in amount.\nHealth and welfare facilities\n109 The specification provides for supply of these facilities for the use of site operatives\nduring the carrying out of the works. It describes the nature of those facilities (see,\nparagraph 23) and identifies their proposed location in Elliott Street. It was explained to\nthe Tribunal by Park West RTM that expenditure on these facilities in the form of a\nsecure welfare unit (portable toilet) was incurred by W & A to meet health and safety\nresponsibilities in this regard and in order to comply with the relevant provisions of the\nConstruction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 and, subsequently, invoiced to\nPark West RTM. In the light of this explanation, the Tribunal is satisfied that there was a\nsensible rationale for the expenditure incurred.\n31\n\nMs Saunders challenged such expenditure on two substantive grounds. First, she\nquestioned whether, in fact, the welfare facility had been provided. This was based on her\nexperience of driving regularly past Park West whilst the works were ongoing and on\nconversations she had held with other leaseholders, but, otherwise, uncorroborated.\nSecondly and assuming that the welfare facility was provided, Ms Saunders questioned\nthe reasonableness of the sum expended which, in her opinion, was too high; a view\nwhich was supported by Mr Healey in his submission to the Tribunal that the cost of\nproviding this facility should have been £2,000.00 (plus VAT). In neither instance, was\nthe Tribunal provided with any independent evidence in support of these propositions.\nAs to the first ground, the Tribunal is handicapped by the absence of any corroborative\nevidence in support of Ms Saunders’ statement which, in turn, is contradicted by the\nphotographic evidence presented by Park West RTM that shows several welfare units in\nsitu in Elliott Street. Further, as to the second ground, the Tribunal attaches little\nevidential weight to the unsupported statements of Ms Saunders and Mr Healey relating\nto the reasonableness of the expenditure.\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that a welfare facility was provided and determines\nthat, in the absence of compelling or persuasive evidence to the contrary, the challenged\nexpenditure was reasonably incurred and that it was reasonable in amount.\nCDM-C co-ordinator\n110 Ms Saunders challenged the appointment of a CDM-C co-ordinator, whose role and\nfunction was described in the specification as, broadly, to advise on matters of health and\nsafety, especially with a view to satisfying HSE requirements, on the basis that it was an\nunnecessary expense. More specifically, the matters allocated to the CDM-C co-ordinator\nshould have been dealt with by W & A as part of their overall responsibility to manage the\nproject in conjunction with others who were involved for the entirety of the works, there\nwas no legal obligation to appoint a CDM-C co-ordinator as the works were not notifiable\nto HSE, and the CDM Regulations 2015 do not envisage the appointment of a CDM-C co-\nordinator. Mr Healey questioned the utility of the pre-construction report prepared by\nthe CDM-C co-ordinator which he regarded as being not sufficiently directed towards\nPark West.\nThe Tribunal accepts that these matters are important considerations. However, it is not\npersuaded that they lead to the conclusion that the challenge to the appointment of the\nBCA Project Services as the CDM-C co-ordinator should be successful. In the Tribunal’s\nopinion, the manner in which it was proposed that the works were to be carried out,\nnamely through abseiling, highlighted the need for particular regard to be paid to matters\nof health and safety generated by this mode of operation. There was no cogent evidence\nto suggest that either W & A or individuals, such as the quantity surveyor or the\nplanner/programmer for the works, either individually or collectively, had sufficient\nexpertise in this respect. It follows that it was appropriate to rely upon a degree of\nspecialist expertise. In this regard, the Tribunal takes the view that, whatever the formal\nrequirements for the appointment of BCA Project Services was one of the reasonable\nways in which this advice might be obtained. In terms of the work undertaken, the\nTribunal acknowledges that the pre-construction report could have been more directly\nfocused on Park West, but, nevertheless its contents were still useful. There was no\nsuggestion that the cost of appointing BCA Project Services should be reduced to reflect\nthe perceived generality of the report.\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that the cost of appointing BCA Project Services as\nCDM-C co-ordinator was reasonably incurred and that it was reasonable in amount.\n32\n\nWorks – reasonable standard\n111 The evidence presented to the Tribunal shows that the parties accepted that there was a\nneed for work to be carried out to the exterior elevations of Park West, whereas, “the nub”\nof the dispute between them related, initially, to the ways in which such work could have\nbeen undertaken and, thereafter, whether the work which was undertaken was completed\nand, if so, to a reasonable standard. In this context, Ms Saunders also questioned the use\nof abseiling to carry out the work rather than a method that employed the use of\nscaffolding.\n112 As to alternative ways in which the work could have been undertaken, Ms Saunders and\nMr Healey on her behalf drew the Tribunal’s attention, particularly, to the prospect of\ncleaning rather than painting the render of Park West, the application of more coats of\npaint than was provided for in the specification, which had been verbally suggested to Ms\nSaunders by the paint shop and, as Mr Healey intimated, was evident from the report of\nBidwells LLP, in order to obtain the requisite finish, and, generally, expressed doubts\nabout the suitability of abseiling for carrying out the works. In these respects, the\nTribunal notes that Park West RTM took independent professional advice, especially\nfrom the retained Architect, in relation to matters pertaining to the painting of the\nbuilding and that no independent, conclusive and compelling evidence was adduced by\nMs Saunders or on her behalf in support of the view expressed about the carrying out of\nthat painting – the response to the inquiry in the paint shop is not evidenced and the\nreport of Bidwells LLP, which was commissioned by Building Transformation, was\ncontradicted to some extent by the maintenance plan for Park West for the period 2018-\n2022 which was prepared by Cloud Surveyors and adduced in evidence by Mr Temporal.\nFurther, Waaler makes it clear that following consultation with leaseholders in the\ncourse of a section 20 consultation relating to proposed works the final decision about\nthe carrying out of those works lies with the landlord. In this instance, the Tribunal has\nfound that the section 20 consultation was completed, even though there were the\npreviously rehearsed difficulties experienced by Ms Saunders (see, paragraphs 42-45). In\nthe event, Park West RTM decided that the works should be carried out by abseiling\nusing a company that was versed in abseiling and with a view to securing a satisfactory\ncompletion of the works. In choosing that option, the evidence shows that Park West\nRTM was mindful that completing the works through the use of scaffolding would have\nbeen significantly more expensive. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied that\nfor the purposes of section 19 of the 1985 Act the decision to use abseiling was\nreasonable. If this is so, it does not matter that others, including the Tribunal, might have\na chosen another reasonable course.\n113 In the context of this Application, the making of such a decision raises expectations that\nthe works will be completed and to a reasonable standard. Although Ms Saunders\nsubmitted that the works were not completed, the Tribunal was persuaded, on the\nevidence, that the works were substantially ‘completed’ albeit in an unorthodox way\nwhich, as the evidence reveals, involved W & A arranging remedial works to rectify the\nperceived shortcomings in the work undertaken by Building Transformation. It is not\nclear to the Tribunal upon what basis and with what authority W & A arranged for this\nwork to be done. Nevertheless, as Mr Temporal informed the Tribunal, Ms Brangan, one\nof the Directors of Park West RTM signed off the works as complete, although it was\nacknowledged that an area in Hermon Street had not been painted for which a deduction\nfrom the cost of the works, which was not challenged by Ms Saunders, was made.\nAs to the separate question of whether the works were undertaken to a reasonable\nstandard, the Tribunal’s inspection of Park West revealed on some elevations, as\nindicated by Mr Healey, what appeared to be uneven application of paint with different\nshaded strips and, notwithstanding the remedial work, evidence of paint splashes\n(including those on Ms Babadi’s balcony). Clearly, there are shortcomings in the work\n33\n\nthat was undertaken, and, hence, the outcome is far from perfect, but the test is not\nperfection rather it is whether the standard of the work is reasonable. The evidence\nadduced in the maintenance plan for 2018-2022 showing the anticipated minimal work\nthat will be required on the external redecoration of Park West during that period is\ninstructive and supportive of a finding that the works have been undertaken to a\nreasonable standard. Further, the case for such a finding is strengthened when the\nstandard of the works undertaken is measured against the actual cost of those works\ntaking into account, in particular, the significant saving on those costs which emanated\nfrom the settlement with Building Transformation which was reflected in a substantial\ndiscount from the final account of Building Transformation. Accordingly, the Tribunal\nfinds that the works were carried out to a reasonable standard.\nConclusion\n114 The Tribunal’s findings on the various aspects of the section 27A application reflect the\npositions adopted by Park West RTM, save in relation to the amount of the management\nfee, as may be regarded as reasonable within the meaning of section 19 of the 1985 Act\nand for the purposes of the Application, which is represented in the following Table.\nBuilding Transfer £97,505.62 (incl vat)\nless repaid -£24,003.15\nArchitect £750.00 (incl vat)\nH&S £5,077.75 (incl vat)\nCDM £1,500.00 (incl vat)\nGutter safe system £1,946.74 (incl vat)\nless credit for non painted area -£1,170.00\nProject management 12.5% £14,625.84 (incl vat)\nTOTAL £96,349.31\n2002 Act application\nPayability of administration charges\n115 Within the context of this application, paragraph 1(1) of Part 1 of Schedule 11 to the 2002\nAct defines an ‘administration charge’ as an amount payable by a tenant as part of or in\naddition to the rent, directly or indirectly, where the tenant fails to make a payment by\nthe due date to the landlord. An application which challenges the payability of such\ncharges may be made to the Tribunal under paragraph 5 of Schedule 11. (see, paragraphs\n35 -37).\n116 In respect of this application, the essence of the dispute between the parties is as follows.\nMs Saunders challenged the payability and reasonableness of two administration\ncharges, each comprising £60.00, which were included in her 2017 service charge\naccount for late payment of service charge. In the latter respect, Ms Saunders adduced no\nevidence as to what might constitute a reasonable amount for such a charge. Ms Saunders\ndoes not dispute either that she has withheld payment of her service charge (for reasons\nassociated with her Application) or that her service charge account is in arrears. Whereas,\nPark West RTM contended that the administration charges were properly applied,\nbecause Ms Saunders is not entitled to withhold payment of the service charge, especially\nthose elements of that service charge about which she has not complained. It also averred\nthat the administration charges were reasonable in amount, although it provided no\nevidence to the Tribunal as to the breakdown of the costs which were covered by the\nadministration charges. Equally, the administration charges were applied to Ms Saunders\nservice charge account on dates that fall outside the service charge period which is the\n34\n\nsubject of Ms Saunders’ Application, and, therefore, Park West RTM submitted that the\nTribunal does not have jurisdiction to make a finding in respect of these administration\ncharges.\n117 As a matter of law, the payability of administration charges for late payment of service\ncharge turns on the proper construction of the particular lease: see, St Mary’s Mansions\nLtd v Limegate Investment Company Limited [2002] EWCA Civ 1491. In this instance,\nthe relevant provisions in the lease are clause 3(1) and paragraph 2(b) of the Third\nSchedule. The latter provides that the tenant has a ‘liability to pay…all costs and expenses\nincurred…in enforcing the payment by the lessee of any…service charge…payable by the\nlessee under the terms of the lease’. As a matter of construction, the Tribunal finds that\nthe word ‘enforcing’ in this paragraph means, literally, ensuring observance of the terms\nof the lease and that this encompasses the application of an administration charge for late\nor non-payment of the service charge. Such an interpretation means that the application\nof an administration charge can act as a deterrent to non-payment and may constitute an\ninitial step in prompting payment and securing compliance with tenants’ obligations\nunder the lease.\n118 The evidence presented to the Tribunal in relation to Ms Saunders’ 2017 service charge\naccount shows that the disputed administration charges were applied to that account in\nJune and October 2017 respectively and that, consequently, they fall outside the service\ncharge year to which the Application relates i.e. April 2016-March 2017. Therefore, the\nTribunal, presently, has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon these particular disputed\nadministration charges. Suffice it to say, there is, in the Tribunal’s opinion, authority in\nthe lease for the application of administration charges in appropriate circumstances.\nSection 20C application\n119 The making of an order by the Tribunal under Section 20C is a matter of discretion. It is a\ndiscretion which may be exercised having regard to what is just and equitable in all the\ncircumstances of the particular case.\n120 Guidance on the exercise of this discretion was given in Tenants of Langford Court v\nDoren Limited (LRX/37/2000). In that case, HHJ Rich said:\n“In my judgment the only principle upon which the discretion should be exercised is to\nhave regard to what is just and equitable in all the circumstances. The circumstances\ninclude the conduct and circumstances of all parties as well as the outcome of the\nproceedings in which they arise.\n…there is no automatic expectation of an order under section 20C in favour of a\nsuccessful tenant, although a landlord who has behaved improperly or unreasonably\ncannot normally expect to recover his costs of defending such conduct.\nIn my judgment the primary consideration that the LVT should keep in mind is that the\npower to make an order under section 20C should be used only in order to ensure that\nthe right to claim costs as part of the service charge is not used in circumstances that\nmakes its use unjust…its purpose is to give an opportunity to ensure fair treatment as\nbetween landlord and tenant, in circumstances where even although costs have been\nreasonably incurred by the landlord, it would be unjust that the tenant or some particular\ntenant should have to pay them.”\n121 Further guidance is given in the Upper Tribunal decision in Conway al v Jam Factory\nFreehold Limited [2013] UKUT 0592 in which Martin Rodger QC observed that it is\nimportant to consider the overall financial consequences of making an order under\n35\n\nsection 20C, and, in particular, that an order made under the section will only affect\nthose persons specified. He also said:\n“[75] In any application under section 20C it seems to me to be essential to consider what\nwill be the practical and financial consequences for all of those who will be affected by the\norder, and to bear those consequences in mind when deciding on the just and equitable\norder to make.”\n122 As this judicial guidance makes clear, a Tribunal should not in deciding whether to\nexercise its discretion under section 20C stray from the principle which underlies the\nexercise of that discretion, namely whether it is just and equitable in all the\ncircumstances of the particular case to do so.\n123 In considering whether to exercise its discretion in relation to Ms Saunders’ Application,\nthe Tribunal took into account all the prevailing circumstances, but, particularly, the\nfollowing.\nAt the outset, it reviewed the principal circumstances which were germane to the making\nof the Application namely, the perceived dilatory response by W & A, whilst acting as\nmanaging agents, to Ms Saunders’ inquiries for information relating to the works which\nhad prompted the Application and which informed the decision of Ms Saunders to\nwithhold payment of the service charge. Thereafter, the Tribunal contemplated aspects of\nthe manner in which the proceedings were conducted. This included a general perception\non the part of the Tribunal based largely on the interchanges at the Hearing that relations\nwere strained; a situation which was not particularly conducive to the resolution of the\nmatters in dispute between the parties. And, more specifically, with regard to the matter\nof dispensation where, in the Tribunal’s opinion, the opportunity to resolve this matter\nmight have been taken sooner by Ms Saunders and where, in view of the fact that the\npossibility of a cap on costs of the works through a failure to meet the consultation\nrequirements of section 20 was explicitly referred to in the Application, a formal\napplication for dispensation by Park West RTM might have been made earlier with a\ncommensurate impact in each instance on the costs of the proceedings.\nThe Tribunal also acknowledged, in accordance with the above judicial guidance, that the\noutcome of the Application, which was predominantly in favour of Park West RTM save\nfor the finding of ‘reasonableness’ in relation to the project management fees, whilst\nrelevant was not determinative of the question of whether or not it should exercise its\ndiscretion under section 20C.\nThe Tribunal was not provided with any evidence relating to the specific financial\nconsequences of the making of an order under section 20C for either party, although, as\nthe evidence shows, the Tribunal was alerted to the significance of service charge revenue\nto the financial viability of Park West RTM.\nIn the light of all the circumstances and the backdrop to the issues addressed and\ndetermined by the Tribunal in relation to the Application, the Tribunal in exercise of its\ndiscretion under section 20C determines that it is just and equitable to make an order in\nfavour of Ms Saunders limited by way of relief to 25% of the costs incurred by Park West\nRTM in connection with the proceedings before the Tribunal. It should be added that this\nis not a determination by the Tribunal of the amount of those costs or any part thereof\nand the Tribunal’s order is without prejudice to any subsequent application by Ms\nSaunders which seeks to challenge such costs on the ground that they are considered to\nbe unreasonable.\n36\n\nSummary of Findings\n124 The findings of the Tribunal in relation to the section 27A application, the 2002 Act\napplication and the section 20C application may be summarised as follows:\nSection 27A application\nThe Tribunal finds that the section 20 consultation was completed with dispensation to\nthe extent specified in the dispensation application.\nThe Tribunal determines that the management fee for the works is £14,625.84 (including\nVAT) and that the fees/costs for the Architect, health and welfare facilities and the CDM-\nC co-ordinator were reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount. The Tribunal also\ndetermines that the works were carried out to a reasonable standard and to a reasonable\neventual total net cost.\n2002 Act application\nThe Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the reasonableness or\notherwise of the administration charges challenged in this Application.\nSection 20C application\nThe Tribunal makes an order under section 20C limited to 25% of the costs incurred by\nPark West RTM in connection with the proceedings before the Tribunal.\n125 Subject to Rule 23(6) of the Tribunal Rules, this decision is binding on each of the parties\nto the application made by Ms Babadi to the extent that it relates to the common issue\nidentified in the Directions dated 12 March 2018.\nJudge David R Salter\nDate: 6th December 2018\nAppeal Provisions\n126 If any party is dissatisfied with this decision they may apply to this Tribunal for\npermission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber). Any such appeal must be\nreceived within 28 days after these written reasons have been sent to the parties (Rule 52\n0f the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013).\n127 If the party wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time limit, the party shall\ninclude with the application for permission to appeal a request for an extension of time\nand the reason for not complying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then\ndecide whether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to appeal to\nproceed.\n128 The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the Tribunal to\nwhich it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\n37"

The rent to have effect from the\ndate in the landlords notice of 25th January 2021.\nBackground\n1. The tribunal received an application under section 13 of the Housing Act\n1988 on 29th March 2021. This included the landlord’s notice proposing\na new rent to commence on 5th April 2021. The notice proposed the rent\nto change from £155.16 per week with a service charge of £2.56 per week\nto a rent of £157.49 per week with a service charge of £3.52 per week.\n2. Neither party requested an oral hearing and written representations\nwere received from the applicant and respondent.\n3. The accommodation the subject of the tenancy, comprises a house with\nthree bedrooms, one living room, one bathroom, a kitchen dinner and a\nshower room. There is a garden and a parking space. The property has\ncentral heating and is double glazed. The carpets and curtains being\nsupplied by the tenant.\n4. The applicant relies on the application form and submissions. They raise\nseveral issues. First that the form of heating “heating and storage tanks”\nis less efficient than modern equivalents. Second there has been an issue\nwith overhanging shrubs along the boundary of the property.\nThe Law\n5. The tribunal first had to determine that the tribunal had jurisdiction to\nhear the Application in order to determine a rent under S14 of the\nHousing Act 1988. In short, the tribunal must determine that the\nLandlord’s notice under Section 13(2) satisfied the requirements of that\nsection and was validly served.\n6. The Act provides in section 13 (2) as amended by the Regulatory Reform\n(Assured Periodic Tenancies) (Rent Increases) Order 2003 that the date\nin paragraph 4 of the Landlord’s notice (the date the new rent becomes\npayable) must comply with three requirements.\n7. The first requirement is that a minimum period of notice must be given\nbefore the proposed new rent can take effect.\n2\n\n8. The second requirement is that the starting date must not be less than\n52 weeks after the date on which the rent was last increased using this\nprocedure although there are exceptions to this.\n9. The third requirement is that the proposed new rent must start at the\nbeginning of a period of the tenancy.\n10. In the present case, the Tenancy started on 4th December 1995.\n11. Section 14 of the Housing Act 1988 requires the tribunal to determine\nthe rent at which it considered the subject property might reasonably be\nexpected to be let on the open market by a willing landlord under an\nassured tenancy.\n12. Only if a landlord’s notice complies with each of the requirements\nreferred to above does a tribunal have jurisdiction to determine a rent\nunder section 14 of the Act.\nThe Decision\n14. The tribunal determined that the three requirements were met.\n15. In coming to its decision, the tribunal relied on its own general\nknowledge of rental levels in the area and evidence supplied by the\nappellant and the respondent.\n16. Given the size and nature of the accommodation, the tribunal determines\nthe rent at £1600 per calendar month, £369.23 per week effective from\nthe 5th April 2021 with service charge of £3.52 per week.\nTribunal Valuer Chair\nName: Date: 14th March 2022\nWaterhouse\n3\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n4\n\nTHE LEGISLATION\nHousing Act 1988\ns.13.— Increases of rent under assured periodic tenancies.\n(1) This section applies to—\n(a) a statutory periodic tenancy other than one which, by virtue of paragraph 11\nor paragraph 12 in Part I of Schedule 1 to this Act, cannot for the time being be\nan assured tenancy; and\n(b) any other periodic tenancy which is an assured tenancy, other than one in\nrelation to which there is a provision, for the time being binding on the tenant,\nunder which the rent for a particular period of the tenancy will or may be greater\nthan the rent for an earlier period.\n(2) For the purpose of securing an increase in the rent under a tenancy to which\nthis section applies, the landlord may serve on the tenant a notice in the\nprescribed form proposing a new rent to take effect at the beginning of a new\nperiod of the tenancy specified in the notice, being a period beginning not earlier\nthan—\n(a) the minimum period after the date of the service of the notice; and\n(b) except in the case of a statutory periodic [tenancy—]\n[\n(i) in the case of an assured agricultural occupancy, the first anniversary of the\ndate on which the first period of the tenancy began;\n(ii) in any other case, on the date that falls 52 weeks after the date on which the\nfirst period of the tenancy began; and\n]\n(c) if the rent under the tenancy has previously been increased by virtue of a\nnotice under this subsection or a determination under section 14[below—]\n[\n(i) in the case of an assured agricultural occupancy, the first anniversary of the\ndate on which the increased rent took effect;\n(ii) in any other case, the appropriate date.\n]\n(3) The minimum period referred to in subsection (2) above is—\n(a) in the case of a yearly tenancy, six months;\n(b) in the case of a tenancy where the period is less than a month, one month;\nand\n(c) in any other case, a period equal to the period of the tenancy.\n[\n(3A) The appropriate date referred to in subsection (2)(c)(ii) above is—\n(a) in a case to which subsection (3B) below applies, the date that falls 53 weeks\nafter the date on which the increased rent took effect;\n(b) in any other case, the date that falls 52 weeks after the date on which the\nincreased rent took effect.\n(3B) This subsection applies where—\n(a) the rent under the tenancy has been increased by virtue of a notice under\nthis section or a determination under section 14 below on at least one occasion\nafter the coming into force of the Regulatory Reform (Assured Periodic\nTenancies) (Rent Increases) Order 2003; and\n5\n\n(b) the fifty-third week after the date on which the last such increase took effect\nbegins more than six days before the anniversary of the date on which the first\nsuch increase took effect.\n]\n(4) Where a notice is served under subsection (2) above, a new rent specified in\nthe notice shall take effect as mentioned in the notice unless, before the\nbeginning of the new period specified in the notice,—\n(a) the tenant by an application in the prescribed form refers the notice to [the\nappropriate tribunal] ; or\n(b) the landlord and the tenant agree on a variation of the rent which is different\nfrom that proposed in the notice or agree that the rent should not be varied.\n(5) Nothing in this section (or in section 14 below) affects the right of the\nlandlord and the tenant under an assured tenancy to vary by agreement any\nterm of the tenancy (including a term relating to rent).\ns.14.— Determination of rent by [tribunal] .\n(1) Where, under subsection (4)(a) of section 13 above, a tenant refers to [the\nappropriate tribunal] a notice under subsection (2) of that section, the\n[appropriate tribunal]3 shall determine the rent at which, subject to subsections\n(2) and (4) below, the [appropriate tribunal]3 consider that the dwelling-house\nconcerned might reasonably be expected to be let in the open market by a willing\nlandlord under an assured tenancy—\n(a) which is a periodic tenancy having the same periods as those of the tenancy\nto which the notice relates;\n(b) which begins at the beginning of the new period specified in the notice;\n(c) the terms of which (other than relating to the amount of the rent) are the\nsame as those of the tenancy to which the notice relates; and\n(d) in respect of which the same notices, if any, have been given under any of\nGrounds 1 to 5 of Schedule 2 to this Act, as have been given (or have effect as if\ngiven) in relation to the tenancy to which the notice relates.\n(2) In making a determination under this section, there shall be disregarded—\n(a) any effect on the rent attributable to the granting of a tenancy to a sitting\ntenant;\n(b) any increase in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a relevant\nimprovement carried out by a person who at the time it was carried out was the\ntenant, if the improvement—\n(i) was carried out otherwise than in pursuance of an obligation to his\nimmediate landlord, or\n(ii) was carried out pursuant to an obligation to his immediate landlord being an\nobligation which did not relate to the specific improvement concerned but arose\nby reference to consent given to the carrying out of that improvement; and\n(c) any reduction in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a failure by\nthe tenant to comply with any terms of the tenancy.\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) above, in relation to a notice which is\nreferred by a tenant as mentioned in subsection (1) above, an improvement is a\nrelevant improvement if either it was carried out during the tenancy to which the\nnotice relates or the following conditions are satisfied, namely—\n(a) that it was carried out not more than twenty-one years before the date of\nservice of the notice; and\n6\n\n(b) that, at all times during the period beginning when the improvement was\ncarried out and ending on the date of service of the notice, the dwelling-house\nhas been let under an assured tenancy; and\n(c) that, on the coming to an end of an assured tenancy at any time during that\nperiod, the tenant (or, in the case of joint tenants, at least one of them) did not\nquit.\n[\n(3A) In making a determination under this section in any case where under Part\nI of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 the landlord or a superior landlord\nis\nliable to pay council tax in respect of a hereditament (“the relevant\nhereditament”) of which the dwelling-house forms part, the [appropriate\ntribunal] shall have regard to the amount of council tax which, as at the date on\nwhich the notice under section 13(2) above was served, was set by the billing\nauthority—\n(a) for the financial year in which that notice was served, and\n(b) for the category of dwellings within which the relevant hereditament fell on\nthat date,\nbut any discount or other reduction affecting the amount of council tax payable\nshall be disregarded.\n(3B) In subsection (3A) above—\n(a) “hereditament” means a dwelling within the meaning of Part I of the Local\nGovernment Finance Act 1992,\n(b) “billing authority” has the same meaning as in that Part of that Act, and\n(c) “category of dwellings” has the same meaning as in section 30(1) and (2) of\nthat Act.\n(4) In this section “rent” does not include any service charge, within the\nmeaning of section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 , but, subject to that,\nincludes any sums payable by the tenant to the landlord on account of the use of\nfurniture [, in respect of council tax] or for any of the matters referred to in\nsubsection (1)(a) of that section, whether or not those sums are separate from\nthe sums payable for the occupation of the dwelling-house concerned or are\npayable under separate agreements.\n(5) Where any rates in respect of the dwelling-house concerned are borne by\nthe landlord or a superior landlord, the [appropriate tribunal] shall make their\ndetermination under this section as if the rates were not so borne.\n(6) In any case where—\n(a) [the appropriate tribunal] have before them at the same time the reference\nof a notice under section 6(2) above relating to a tenancy (in this subsection\nreferred to as “the section 6 reference”) and the reference of a notice under\nsection 13(2) above relating to the same tenancy (in this subsection referred to\nas “the section 13 reference”), and\n(b) the date specified in the notice under section 6(2) above is not later than the\nfirst day of the new period specified in the notice under section 13(2) above, and\n(c) the [appropriate tribunal]9 propose to hear the two references together,\nthe [appropriate tribunal] shall make a determination in relation to the section\n6 reference before making their determination in relation to the section 13\nreference and, accordingly, in such a case the reference in subsection (1)(c)\nabove to the terms of the tenancy to which the notice relates shall be construed\n7\n\nas a reference to those terms as varied by virtue of the determination made in\nrelation to the section 6 reference.\n(7) Where a notice under section 13(2) above has been referred to [the\nappropriate tribunal] , then, unless the landlord and the tenant otherwise agree,\nthe rent determined by [the appropriate tribunal] (subject, in a case where\nsubsection (5) above applies, to the addition of the appropriate amount in\nrespect of rates) shall be the rent under the tenancy with effect from the\nbeginning of the new period specified in the notice or, if it appears to [the\nappropriate tribunal] that that would cause undue hardship to the tenant,\nthat that would cause undue hardship to the tenant, with effect from such later\ndate (not being later than the date the rent is determined) as the committee may\ndirect.\n(8) Nothing in this section requires [the appropriate tribunal] to continue with\ntheir determination of a rent for a dwelling-house if the landlord and tenant give\nnotice in writing that they no longer require such a determination or if the\ntenancy has come to an end.\n(9) This section shall apply in relation to an assured shorthold tenancy as if in\nsubsection (1) the reference to an assured tenancy were a reference to an\nassured shorthold tenancy.\n8"

Mr Lionel Levine applies to the Tribunal under Section 20ZA of Landlord and Tenant\nAct 1985 (the Act) for dispensation from the consultation requirements of Section 20\nof the Act and the Service Charges (Consultation Requirements)(England)\nRegulations 2003 (SI 2003/1987) in respect of replacement of cladding and balcony\ndecking with non-combustible material at St George’s Building, Great George Street,\nLeeds LS1 3DL (the Property).\n2. The Respondents are Leaseholders of apartments at the Property.\nGrounds and Submissions\n3. The application is dated 25 March 2021.\n4. The Applicant is the Freeholder and Successor to the Lessor of the Leases of the\napartments at the Property.\n5. On 23 April 2021 Judge J Holbrook made directions requiring service of the\ndocuments by the Applicant on each Respondent. The directions provided that in the\nabsence of a request for a hearing the application would be determined upon the\nparties’ written submissions.\n6. The Property is a purpose built 13 storey building comprising 93 residential\napartments.\n7. The Applicant explains that: “The replacement of cladding and balcony decking is\nnecessary to comply with current safety requirements.”\n8. The Applicant’s statement of case states that: “In order to comply with the Homes\nEngland’s prescribed timeframe for the costs to be submitted and work started on-\nsite, we chose to use Homes England’s robust YorBuild Framework route…… There\nare limited contractors available to carry out this specialist work so it would not have\nbeen practical to go out to tender, the Framework route provides for cost consultants\nand quantity surveyors that ensure the project costs are reasonable.”\n9. The Applicant states that all Leaseholders have been made aware that work is\nrequired and that an application has been made to the British Safety Fund for the\nwork although balcony work will not be covered. A notice of intention has been sent\nto all Leaseholders.\n10. One quotation has been received but dispensation is sought: “As on advice from the\nBSF we have used a Framework option with an approved Government contractor ….”\n11. In response to directions the Applicant has provided a statement of case, copy\ncorrespondence to Leaseholders, a sample Lease and within its case statement\nreasons for urgency.\n12. The Tribunal did not receive submissions from a Respondent Leaseholder. Neither\nthe Applicant nor a Respondent requested a hearing. It is noted a single Respondent\ncompleted a response proforma.\n13. The Tribunal convened without the parties to make its determination on 12 July 2021.\n2\n\nLaw\n14. Section 18 of the Act defines “service charge” and “relevant costs”.\n15. Section 19 of the Act limits the amount payable by the lessees to the extent that the\ncharges are reasonably incurred.\n16. Section 20 of the Act states:-\n“Limitation of service charges: consultation requirements\nWhere this Section applies to any qualifying works…… the relevant contributions of\ntenants are limited……. Unless the consultation requirements have either:-\na. complied with in relation to the works or\nb. dispensed with in relation to the works by …… a tribunal.\nThis Section applies to qualifying works, if relevant costs incurred on carrying out the\nworks exceed an appropriate amount”.\n17. “The appropriate amount” is defined by regulation 6 of The Service Charges\n(Consultation Requirements) (England) Regulations 2003 (the Regulations) as “…….\nan amount which results in the relevant contribution of any tenant being more than\n£250.00.”\n18. Section 20ZA(1) of the Act states:-\n\"Where an application is made to a Tribunal for a determination to dispense with all\nor any of the consultation requirements in relation to any qualifying works ……..…..\nthe tribunal may make the determination if satisfied that it is reasonable to dispense\nwith the requirements.\"\nTribunal’s Conclusions with Reasons\n19. We considered the written evidence accompanying the application.\nOur conclusions are:-\n20. It is not necessary for us to consider at this stage the extent of the service charges that\nwould result from the works payable under the terms of the Respondent’s leases. If\nand when such is demanded and if disputed, it may properly be the subject of a future\napplication to the Tribunal.\n21. We accept from the details provided that installation work is urgent. There is a\ncontinuing risk which has an obvious and significant potential to impact on the health\nand safety of occupiers and visitors to the apartments at the Property.\n22. Although formal consultation has not taken place, we accept that Leaseholders are\naware of the underlying issue and this application. Balancing the need for urgent\naction against dispensing with statutory requirements devised to protect service\ncharge paying Leaseholders, we conclude the urgency outweighs any identified\nprejudice. We understand there may be a potential saving in Waking Watch costs\nalthough that is not determinative. Dispensation from consultation requirements\ndoes not imply that the resulting service charge is reasonable.\n23. We conclude it reasonable in accordance with Section 20ZA(1) of the Act to dispense\nwith the consultation requirements, specified in Section 20 and contained in Service\nCharges (Consultation Requirements)(England) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/1987).\n3\n\n24. Nothing in this determination or order shall preclude consideration of whether the\nApplicant may recover by way of service charge from the Respondents any or all of\nthe cost of the work undertaken or the costs of this application should a reference be\nreceived under Section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.\nOrder\n25. The Applicant is dispensed from complying with the consultation requirements in\nrespect of the work specified in the application.\nLaurence J Bennett\nTribunal Judge\n12 July 2021\n4"

      "text": "FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL\nPROPERTY CHAMBER\n(RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY)\nCase Reference : LON/00BF/OC9/2021/0024\nProperty : 166 Washington Road, Worcester Park, KT4 8JJ\nApplicant : Judith Moore\nRespondent : Melita Dixon\nType of App. : Determination of reasonableness of costs\nTribunal Member : Judge Shepherd\nDate of Decision : 15th March 2022\n1. In this case the Applicant, Judith Moore, (“The applicant”) is challenging legal\ncosts incurred by the Respondent Melita Dixon (“The Respondent”) in relation\nto a lease extension obtained by the Applicant of premises at 166 Washington\nRd, Worcester Park KT4 8JJ (“The premises”) of which the Respondent is the\nfreeholder.\n2. The application ought to have been straightforward but both sides have chosen\nto use it as a means of attacking the conduct of the other. The majority of their\nallegations are irrelevant to the application itself. There are numerous\ndocuments in the bundle many of which are also irrelevant. The Tribunal is in\nthe invidious position of having to address this dispute without the ability to\nhear live evidence. This case was always listed as a paper hearing but neither\nside seems to have acknowledged this. How they expect the tribunal to reach\n1\n\nany affirmative decisions in relation to conduct without hearing live evidence is\na mystery. In any event neither side has explained why conduct is relevant to\nthe issue in question namely the costs incurred during the enfranchisement.\n3. The Tribunal makes clear here that it does not intend to resolve the disputes in\nrelation to conduct allegations made by both sides because it is largely\nirrelevant to the issue in question and in any event having read the extensive\nbundle the Tribunal considers that both parties have behaved badly and if\nanything their conduct balances out.\n4. Accordingly, it is appropriate in this case to ignore the issue of conduct and look\nsolely at the central issue which is the reasonableness of costs incurred by the\nRespondent during the lease extension process.\n5. The Applicant’s application originally sought to argue that the Respondent’s\ncosts of £4246.80 were unreasonable and a more appropriate figure was £500\nplus VAT. She has now adjusted her argument to a more realistic one and has\nforensically gone through the costs incurred by the Respondent during the\nenfranchisement process and disputed individual items so that the amount in\nissue is now the difference between the claimed sum of £4382. 50 and the\noffered sum of £242 7.50. i.e. £1955.\nBrief background\n6. Neither side saw the importance of providing the tribunal with a chronology of\nevents although buried within the bundle in the Applicant’s submissions is a list\nof key dates.\n• The tenant’s section 42 notice was served on 19 December 2019 suggesting\na valuation date at £3250.\n2\n\n• The landlord’s section 45 notice was served on 25 February 2020 with the\nvaluation suggested at £6100.\n• An application was made to the FTT to resolve the dispute on 18 August\n2020.\n• The lease terms were agreed and there was completion on 7 January 2021.\n7. Accordingly, the application to the FTT in relation to the valuation dispute\nbecame otiose and the sole remaining issue was the question of costs incurred\nby the Respondent in carrying out the process of enfranchisement.\n8. It is notable that the situation has been complicated by both sides chopping and\nchanging in terms of their instruction of solicitors. It is regrettable that both\nsides chose to jettison their solicitors prior to this application being considered\nas the solicitors might have injected some commonsense into the parties. As it\nis what is a relatively modest dispute in terms of amount at issue has been\ninflated into a disproportionate use of tribunal time.\nThe law\n9. S.60 of the Leasehold Reform Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 is the\nrelevant provision\n60.— Costs incurred in connection with new lease to be paid by tenant.\n(1) Where a notice is given under section 42, then (subject to the provisions of\nthis section) the tenant by whom it is given shall be liable, to the extent that\n3\n\nthey have been incurred by any relevant person in pursuance of the notice, for\nthe reasonable costs of and incidental to any of the following matters,\nnamely—\n(a) any investigation reasonably undertaken of the tenant's right to a new\nlease;\n(b) any valuation of the tenant's flat obtained for the purpose of fixing the\npremium or any other amount payable by virtue of Schedule 13 in connection\nwith the grant of a new lease under section 56;\n(c) the grant of a new lease under that section;\nbut this subsection shall not apply to any costs if on a sale made voluntarily a\nstipulation that they were to be borne by the purchaser would be void.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) any costs incurred by a relevant person\nin respect of professional services rendered by any person shall only be\nregarded as reasonable if and to the extent that costs in respect of such services\nmight reasonably be expected to have been incurred by him if the\ncircumstances had been such that he was personally liable for all such costs.\n(3) Where by virtue of any provision of this Chapter the tenant's notice ceases\nto have effect, or is deemed to have been withdrawn, at any time, then (subject\nto subsection (4)) the tenant's liability under this section for costs incurred by\nany person shall be a liability for costs incurred by him down to that time.\n(4) A tenant shall not be liable for any costs under this section if the tenant's\nnotice ceases to have effect by virtue of section 47(1) or 55(2).\n(5) A tenant shall not be liable under this section for any costs which a party\nto any proceedings under this Chapter before [the appropriate tribunal]1\nincurs in connection with the proceedings.\n(6) In this section “relevant person” , in relation to a claim by a tenant under\nthis Chapter, means the landlord for the purposes of this Chapter, any other\nlandlord (as defined by section 40(4)) or any third party to the tenant's lease.\n4\n\nDetermination\n10. The Tribunal will use the Scott schedules from page 50 onwards of the bundle.\nMercifully some of the costs are agreed. In relation to the items in dispute the tribunal\nmakes the following determinations:\nInvoice 4347\n11.Item 6-it is agreed that this sum is excessive and the amount allowed is £300\n12.Item 7-the sum is reasonable and allowed at £125\n13.Item 8-the sum is reasonable and allowed at £125\n14, Item 9-this sum of £475 is patently excessive for the work involved which is stated\nto be reviewing a grant of probate and the validity of notice with a phone call to the\nclient to obtain further details and finalising the section 45 counter notice. The\ntribunal awards £300\n15. Item 10-the Applicant argues that this sum does not fall within section 60 (1) (c) of\nthe Act as the landlord had not provided a draft lease at that stage. This is misguided.\nIt is clear that the Respondent was telephoning her solicitor to discuss the lease terms\nbecause the Applicant had proposed different terms and such discussions would fall\nwithin the realm of section 60 (1) (c) which is wide enough to cover other matters\nassociated with the grant of a new lease. The fact that a draft lease had not been\nprovided is not determinative. Accordingly, as no offer has been made by the Applicant\nthe Tribunal accepts the sum of £75.\n5\n\nInvoice 5389\n16. Item 1 relates to forwarding the section 45 notice to the Respondent. The Applicant\nsays this is not recoverable as it is not within the realm of section 60. The Tribunal\naccepts that this sum is per se recoverable as part of investigations and allows the £25\nclaimed.\n17. Item 2 is also accepted on the same basis and £25 is allowed.\n18. Item 3 is also accepted on the same basis and £25 is allowed.\n19. Item 4 is also accepted on the same basis and £50 is allowed.\n20. Item 5 is also accepted on the same basis and £50 is allowed.\n21. Item 6 is also accepted and £25 is allowed.\n22. Item 7 is also accepted £175 is allowed.\n23. Item 8 is accepted and £25 is allowed.\n24. Item 9 is not accepted because it concerns the recoverability of costs which does\nnot strictly fall within section 60.\n25. Item 10 is also not allowed on the same basis as item 9\n6\n\n26. Item 11 is also not allowed on the same basis as item 9\n27. Item 12 relates to the grant of the lease therefore the £50 is allowed\n28. Item 13 is not allowed on the same basis as item 9 above\n29. Item 14 is allowed although it is difficult to see exactly what work was involved. On\nbalance £50 is allowed.\nInvoice 5989\n30. Item 3 concerns reviewing the lease with advice to the client. Although this does\ncome within section 60 the sum is excessive and £300 is allowed.\n31. Item 4 is not allowed it is not clear how this comes within section 60.\n32. Item 5 is not allowed as it clearly does not come within section 60.\n33. Item 6 does not come within section 60 as it is in relation to these proceedings.\n34. Item 7 does not come within section 60 as it involves the proceedings themselves.\n35. Item 8 is deducted on the same basis as item 7.\n36. Item 9 is deducted on the same basis as item 7.\n7\n\nInvoice 6408\n37. Item 11 is deducted on the basis that it involves the proceedings themselves.\n38. Item 12 is allowed at £125 as it concerns the grant of a new lease.\n39. Item 13 is unclear as to what it involves but on balance the Tribunal will allow the\n£25.\n40. Item 14 is unclear as to what it involves but on balance the Tribunal will allow the\n£25 claimed.\n41. Item 15 is discounted because it involves the proceedings themselves.\nSummary\n42. The sums allowed for the various invoices are the following:\n4347 - £1327.50\n5389-£500\n5989-£425\n6408-£550\nJudge Shepherd\n15th March 2022\n8\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about\nany right of appeal they may have. If a party wishes to appeal this decision\nto the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), then a written application for\npermission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at the regional office\nwhich has been dealing with the case. The application for permission to\nappeal must arrive at the regional office within 28 days after the tribunal\nsends written reasons for the decision to the person making the\napplication.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the reason\nfor not complying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at\nsuch reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission\nto appeal to proceed, despite not being within the time limit. The\napplication for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making\nthe application is seeking. If the tribunal refuses to grant permission to\nappeal, a further application for permission may be made to the Upper\nTribunal (Lands Chamber).\n9"

The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR27"

      "text": "FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL\nPROPERTY CHAMBER\n(RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY)\nCase reference : LON/00AJ/F77/2025/0108\nFlat D 165 The Vale, Acton, London W3\nProperty :\n7RD\nApplicant (Tenant) : Ms Margaret Cooney\nRepresentative : Linda Quinn (Niece)\nRespondent\n: A2 Dominion Group\n(Landlord)\nRepresentative : None\nType of application : Section 70 of the Rent Act 1977\nMr D Jagger MRICS\nTribunal members :\nMr L Packer\nDate of Reasons : 16 May 2025\nReasons\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nThe Tribunal determines £542.17 per month is to be registered as\nthe fair rent for the above property with effect from the 16 May 2025\nbeing the date of the Tribunal's decision.\nThe reasons for this decision are set out below.\nReasons\nBackground\n1 On 18 November 2024 the landlord, applied to the Valuation Office Agency\n(Rent Officer) for registration of a fair rent of £1,342.50 per month for the\nproperty, which is 25% owned by the tenant, who pays rent on the remaining\n75%.\n2 The previous Registered Rent at the time of the application was £358.54 per\nmonth, effective from 21 August 2008, some 17 years ago.\n3 On 10 January 2025 the Rent Officer registered a fair rent of £653.57 per\nmonth, effective from that date. The rent increase imposed by the Rent Officer\nhas not been “capped” or limited by the operation of the Rent Acts (Maximum\nFair Rent) Order 1999 (‘ the Order’).\n4 By an email dated 29 January 2025 from Linda Quinn, the tenant’s niece and\nrepresentative, the tenant objected to the rent determined by the Rent Officer\nand the matter was referred to this Tribunal. In the tenant’s Reply Form, the\ntenant requested a hearing to consider this matter.\n5 These reasons address in summary form the key issues raised by the parties.\nThey do not recite each point referred to in submissions but concentrate on\nthose issues which, in the Tribunal’s view, are fundamental to the\ndetermination.\nThe law\n6 When determining a fair rent the Tribunal, in accordance with the Rent Act\n1977, section 70, must have regard to all the circumstances including the age,\nlocation and state of repair of the property. It also must disregard the effect of\n(a) any relevant tenant's improvements and (b) the effect of any disrepair or\nother defect attributable to the tenant, on the rental value of the property.\nSection 70(2) of the Rent Act 1977 imposes on the Tribunal an assumption that\nthe number of persons seeking to become tenants of similar dwelling house in\nthe locality on the terms (other than those relating to rent) of the regulated\ntenancy is not substantially greater than the number of such dwelling houses in\nthe locality which are available for letting on such terms. This is commonly\ncalled ‘scarcity’.\n2\n\nIn Spath Holme Ltd v Chairman of the Greater Manchester Council (1995) 28\nHLR 107 and Curtis v London Rent Assessment Tribunal [1999] QB 92 the\nCourt of Appeal emphasised\n(a) that ordinarily a fair rent is the market rent for the property\ndiscounted for 'scarcity' (i.e. that element, if any, of the market rent,\nthat is attributable to there being a significant shortage of similar\nproperties in the wider locality available for letting on similar terms\n- other than as to rent - to that of the regulated tenancy) and\n(b) that for the purposes of determining the market rent, assured\ntenancy (market) rents are usually appropriate comparables. (These\nrents may have to be adjusted where necessary to reflect any relevant\ndifferences between those comparables and the subject property).\nThe Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 places a “cap” on the\npermissible amount of the increase of a fair rent between one registration and\nthe next, by reference to the amount of the increase in the United Kingdom\nIndex of Retail Prices between the dates of the two registrations. Where the cap\napplies the Rent Officer and the Tribunal is prevented from increasing the\namount of the fair rent that it registers beyond the maximum fair rent calculated\nin accordance with the provisions of the Order and the mathematical formula\nset out in the Order.\nBy article 2(7) of the 1999 Order the capping provisions do not apply “in respect\nof a dwelling-house if because of a change in the condition of the dwelling-\nhouse or the common parts as a result of repairs or improvements (including\nthe replacement of any fixture or fitting) carried out by the landlord or a\nsuperior landlord, the rent that is determined in response to an application for\nregistration of a new rent under Part IV exceeds by at least 15% the previous\nrent registered or confirmed.”\nThe Hearing and Inspection.\n7 At the tenant’s request a hearing took place at 9.30am on 16 May 2025 at 10\nAlfred Place London WC1E 7LR in the presence of the tenant and Linda Quinn.\nThe landlord did not attend. The tenant was given the opportunity to elaborate\non her written submissions and the Tribunal explained to the tenant the\nmethodology for the calculation of the capped rent which is the maximum rent\nthat can be charged. In the bundle of evidence submitted to the Tribunal by the\ntenant there is a letter dated the 10 March 2025 from the Landlord which sets\nout a summary of the monthly payments to be made from the 15 March 2025\nthrough to the 15 March 2026. The monthly payment is £294.75 inclusive of\nservice charge. Therefore, it must be assumed this is the new rental payment\nsought by the landlord for the year ending 15 March 2026. A further letter dated\nthe 25 April 2025 from Calvin Thain of A2 Dominion confirms there is a credit\nof £5,019.07 on the tenants account.\n3\n\n8 The Tribunal inspected the property following the hearing in the presence of\nthe tenant. The property is a self-contained purpose built flat situated on the\nthird floor of a mid terrace Victorian building with commercial premises on the\nground floor. Accommodation consists of a reception room, kitchen, bedroom,\nbathroom and WC. The property is located busy mixed commercial and\nresidential area convenient to local amenities and transport facilities. The\nproperty is approached via a poorly maintained communal area with a steep\nand narrow staircase leading to the third floor, which would restrict\nmarketability.\n9 The property has gas central heating, single glazed timber windows. Floor\ncoverings, curtains, central heating boiler (replaced at the tenant’s cost). Fitted,\nwardrobes and white goods were provided by the tenant.\nTerms of the tenancy\n10 The Tribunal issued Directions on the 1 April 2025. A copy of the tenancy\nagreement was not provided to the Tribunal. The landlord states in the\napplication for registration of fair rent, the periodic protected tenancy\ncommenced on the 1 August 1986. The detailed calculations for the assessment\nof this proposed new rent is provided in these reasons for the decision.\nEvidence\n11 The Tribunal had copies of the Valuation Office Agency correspondence\nincluding the rent registers effective 21 August 2008 and 10 January 2025\ntogether with the detailed calculations for the most recent registration.\n12 The tenant submitted a statement challenging the proposed increase in rent\ntogether with a completed Reply Form. The landlord did not provide any\nwritten submissions, and no comparable rental evidence was provided by the\nparties.\nValuation\n13 In the first instance the Tribunal determined what rent the landlord could\nreasonably be expected to obtain for the property in the open market if it were\nlet today in the condition that is considered usual for such an open market\nletting.\n14 Based upon the evidence provided by the Tenant together with its expert\nknowledge of the Acton area, the Tribunal considers that the open market rent\nfor the property if it were in good marketable condition, with reasonably\nmodern kitchen and bathroom fittings, modern services, carpets and curtains\nand white goods supplied by the landlord, would be £1,500 per month.\n15 Next, the Tribunal needs to adjust that hypothetical rent of £1,500 per month\nto allow for the differences between the terms of this tenancy, the lack of white\n4\n\ngoods, carpets and curtains, rot infestation to single glazed windows, staining\nto ceiling plaster caused by leaks to the flat roof, dated kitchen and sanitary\nfittings and the tenant’s decorating responsibilities (disregarding the effect of\ntenant’s improvements and any disrepair or other defect attributable to the\ntenant).\n16 The Tribunal has considered very carefully the information prepared by the\nTenant. Using its own expertise, the Tribunal considers that deductions of 35%\nshould be applied in order to take into account the terms of the tenancy, the\ncondition of the property and the lack of carpets, curtains and white goods. This\nprovides a deduction of £525 per month from the hypothetical rent. This\nreduces the figure to £975 per month.\n17 It should be noted that this figure cannot be a simple arithmetical calculation\nand is not based upon capital costs but is the Tribunal’s estimate of the amount\nby which the rent would need to be reduced to attract a tenant.\nScarcity\n18 Thirdly, the Tribunal then went on to consider whether a deduction falls to\nbe made to reflect scarcity within the meaning of section 70(2) of the 1977 Act.\nThe tribunal followed the decision of the High Court in Yeomans Row\nManagement Ltd v London Rent Assessment Committee, in which it was held\nthat scarcity over a wide area should be considered rather than scarcity in\nrelation to a particular locality.\n19 In the Tribunal’s opinion there should be a deduction of 20% for scarcity as\nit is considered demand outweighs supply of rented properties in the area. This\nprovides a figure of £195 and therefore reduces the rent to £780 per month.\n20. Next, the service charge figure of £26.96 is deducted together with an\nadjustment for the internal repair covenants which has been calculated at 10%\n(£78.00) This now provides a revised total of £675.04.\n21. A further deduction is made for management, audit and insurance fees\nwhich is calculated at 4.5%. (£30.38) This produces a Gross Rent of £644.66\n22. The next step is to adjust for the 25% share held by the tenant which equates\nto £161.16 which provides the specific rent of 75% being £484.83.\n23. Finaly, the service charge and management fees are added back (£57.34)\nThis produces the Fair Rent to be registered, subject to rent capping at a figure\nof £542.17 per month.\nConclusion\n20 The capping provisions of the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order do not\napply and therefore the above figure is the new Registered Rent. For\ninformation, the capped rent in accordance with the attached calculations is\n£697.46 per month.\n5\n\n21 Therefore, the fair rent to be registered limited by the Rent Acts (Maximum\nFair Rent) Order 1999 is £542.17 per month with effect from the 16 May 2025\nbeing the date of the Tribunals decision.\n22 Detailed calculations for the capped maximum fair rent are provided\nattached to the decision form.\n23 The tenant Ms Cooney brought her case to the Tribunal because of her\nanxiety that she could face such a large increase as the £653.57 per month\ndetermined by the Rent Officer. The Tribunal reminded Miss Cooney that the\nfigure which both the Rent officer and the Tribunal determined was the\nmaximum allowable rent; that it was open to a landlord to charge a lower\namount of rent; and that this was often the case with social landlords – As A2\nDominion had indeed done with Miss Cooney’s rent in the past. Moreover, it\nappeared that Miss Cooney’s rent was in any event has been fixed at £294.75\nper month until 15 March 2026.\n24. The Tribunal suggested to Miss Cooney that when she had received the\nTribunal’s decision, she contact A2 Dominion and seek its confirmation that the\nrent to apply after 16 May 2025 will be £294.75, as in its letter of 10 March\n2025; and, if possible, an indication of the rent it would anticipate seeking after\nMarch 2026.\nD Jagger MRICS Valuer Chair\n16 May 2025\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application\nby email to rpslondon@justice.gov.uk to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nRegional office which has been dealing with the case.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the\nTribunal sends to the person making the application written reasons for\nthe decision.\n3. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28 day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to\nappeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide\n6\n\nwhether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to\nappeal to proceed.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state the\nresult the party making the application is seeking.\n7"

The Tribunal determines that the reasonable legal costs of the\nRespondents in dealing with the matters in section 9(4) of the\nLeasehold Reform Act 1967 are £1192.50 (plus VAT), together with\nvaluer’s fee of £525 (plus VAT), Land Registry Fee of £12 and postage\nof £6.40.\nBackground\n2. The Applicant holds the property at 14 Lanehead Walk (the Property)\nby way of a lease dated 30 December 1970.\n3. On 30 April 2018, following a determination by the Tribunal of the\nprice payable by the Applicant for the freehold, the Applicant applied to\nthe Tribunal for a determination of the Respondents’ costs payable by\nthe Applicant under section 21(1)(ba) of the 1967 Act.\nSubmissions\n4. The Tribunal determined the matter on the basis of written\nsubmissions with supporting evidence, from the parties. The\nsubmissions of the Applicant were dated 19 October 2018, and of the\nRespondents, 24 October 2018.\n5. The valuation fee of £525 plus VAT is agreed.\n6. The Applicant did not challenge the hourly rate of £265.00, Land\nRegistry costs, and postage. The amount of work incurred was\nchallenged.\nReasons\n7. The Applicant served two Notices of Claim upon the Respondent. It is\naccepted by the Applicant that the first Notice contained an error, in\nthat the Respondent was named as Wallace Properties Limited instead\nof Wallace Group Reversionary Group Holding Limited. The Tribunal\nfinds that the first incorrect Notice required the Respondent to\nundertake work for which the Applicant must pay. The Applicant\naccepted a modest amount of additional work. The Tribunal found a\nhigher amount of additional work than that proposed by the Applicant\nwas reasonably incurred.\n8. The Applicant submitted that service of a Notice in Reply (counter-\nnotice) does not come with paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 9(4) of the\nAct, relying on the 5th edition of Hague, page 170. The Tribunal finds\nthat service of a Notice in Reply does come within those paragraphs,\n2\n\nand relies upon the case cited by the Respondents of Sinclair Gardens\nInvestment (Kensington) Limited v Wisbey [2016] UKUT 0203 (LC).\nThe Applicant is responsible for the Respondents’ reasonable costs of\nthe counter-notice.\n9.

By a claim form issued in the County Court about 7th May 2024 under\nclaim number L1QZ12N5, the applicant claimant claimed against the\nrespondent defendant the sum of £12,162.51 in respect of “half yearly\nservice charge [due] in advance” from 1st October 2017 to 1st April 2022,\n£1,989 said to be due on 1st October 2019 in respect of “arrears recovery”\nand £60 said to be due on 17th May 2022 in respect of a late payment\ncharge.\n2. By order of 15th April 2025 District Judge Jacobs ordered that the case\nbe transferred to this Tribunal. The claims for £1,989 said to be due on\n1st October 2019 in respect of “arrears recovery” and £60 said to be due\non 17th May 2022 in respect of a late payment charge are not within our\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 05BA\n\njurisdiction and we do not determine these. These will be a matter for\nthe County Court once the matter is transferred back to it.\n3. The Tribunal subsequently gave directions and in particular ordered that\nthe parties prepare a Scott Schedule setting out their respective cases.\n4. Although the Claim Form in the County Court claimed only estimated\nservice charges payable in advance, the parties in fact pleaded final\namounts due in all the service charge years up to the years ending 31st\nMarch 2022 and 31st March 2023. The parties agreed that we should\ndetermine the final amounts in the years up to the year ending 31st\nMarch 2021 and we have done so.\n5. At the commencement of the hearing before us, the respondent indicated\nthat she wanted us to determine final figures in the service charge years\nending 31st March 2022 to date. This was first suggested in a document\ndated 5th October 2025. No disclosure of documents had been given.\nThe applicant opposed the application.\n6. We indicated that we only had jurisdiction over the matters referred to\nus by the County Court. In view of the lateness of the application, it was\ninappropriate to adjourn to allow for the issuance of a formal application\nto the Tribunal for determination of the matters which fell outwith the\ntransfer from the County Court. Nor was it appropriate to grant an\nadjournment for the amendment of the Scott Schedule.\n7. The respondent accepted this position and we proceeded to hear the\nmatters which were before us.\n8. The respondent gave evidence on her own behalf. The applicant had Ms\nGeorgia Busby in attendance to give evidence, but in fact her first\ninvolvement in the property was from September 2024, so she was able\nto give very little relevant information. The applicant relied largely just\non such documents as it was able to produce. (There were various\nlacunae which we note in the Scott Schedule.)\n9. As to costs, in our judgment the respondent has had a substantial degree\nof success. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to make no order for\ncosts in respect of the fees payable to the Tribunal. There were no other\napplications for costs.\nDECISION\n(a) We determine that the sums payable by the respondent\ndefendant to the applicant claimant are as set out in the Scott\nSchedule attached to this decision.\n(b) We make no order for costs in respect of any fees payable to\nthe Tribunal.\n(c) We transfer this matter back to the County Court sitting at\nKingston-upon-Thames.\n2\n\nSigned Adrian Jack Date: 17th October 2025\nSCHEDULE OF LEGISLATION\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 (as amended)\nSection 18\n(1) In the following provisions of this Act \"service charge\" means an\namount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to\nthe rent -\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements or insurance or the landlord's\ncosts of management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to\nthe relevant costs.\n(2) The relevant costs are the costs or estimated costs incurred or to be\nincurred by or on behalf of the landlord, or a superior landlord, in\nconnection with the matters for which the service charge is payable.\n(3) For this purpose -\n(a) \"costs\" includes overheads, and\n(b) costs are relevant costs in relation to a service charge\nwhether they are incurred, or to be incurred, in the period\nfor which the service charge is payable or in an earlier or\nlater period.\nSection 19\n(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the\namount of a service charge payable for a period -\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provisions of services or the\ncarrying out of works, only if the services or works are of a\nreasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.\n(2) Where a service charge is payable before the relevant costs are\nincurred, no greater amount than is reasonable is so payable, and\nafter the relevant costs have been incurred any necessary\nadjustment shall be made by repayment, reduction or subsequent\ncharges or otherwise.\nSection 27A\n3\n\n(1) An application may be made to the appropriate tribunal for a\ndetermination whether a service charge is payable and, if it is, as to\n-\n(a) the person by whom it is payable,\n(b) the person to whom it is payable,\n(c) the amount which is payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it is payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it is payable.\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not any payment has been made.\n(3) An application may also be made to the appropriate tribunal for a\ndetermination whether, if costs were incurred for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements, insurance or management of any\nspecified description, a service charge would be payable for the\ncosts and, if it would, as to -\n(a) the person by whom it would be payable,\n(b) the person to whom it would be payable,\n(c) the amount which would be payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it would be payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it would be payable.\n(4) No application under subsection (1) or (3) may be made in respect\nof a matter which -\n(a) has been agreed or admitted by the tenant,\n(b) has been, or is to be, referred to arbitration pursuant to a\npost-dispute arbitration agreement to which the tenant is a\nparty,\n(c) has been the subject of determination by a court, or\n(d) has been the subject of determination by an arbitral tribunal\npursuant to a post-dispute arbitration agreement.\n(5) But the tenant is not to be taken to have agreed or admitted any\nmatter by reason only of having made any payment.\nSection 20\n(1) Where this section applies to any qualifying works or qualifying\nlong term agreement, the relevant contributions of tenants are\nlimited in accordance with subsection (6) or (7) (or both) unless the\nconsultation requirements have been either—\n(a) complied with in relation to the works or agreement, or\n(b) dispensed with in relation to the works or agreement by (or\non appeal from) the appropriate tribunal .\n(2) In this section “relevant contribution”, in relation to a tenant and\nany works or agreement, is the amount which he may be required\nunder the terms of his lease to contribute (by the payment of\nservice charges) to relevant costs incurred on carrying out the\nworks or under the agreement.\n4\n\n(3) This section applies to qualifying works if relevant costs incurred\non carrying out the works exceed an appropriate amount.\n(4) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that this section\napplies to a qualifying long term agreement—\n(a) if relevant costs incurred under the agreement exceed an\nappropriate amount, or\n(b) if relevant costs incurred under the agreement during a\nperiod prescribed by the regulations exceed an appropriate\namount.\n(5) An appropriate amount is an amount set by regulations made by\nthe Secretary of State; and the regulations may make provision for\neither or both of the following to be an appropriate amount—\n(a) an amount prescribed by, or determined in accordance with,\nthe regulations, and\n(b) an amount which results in the relevant contribution of any\none or more tenants being an amount prescribed by, or\ndetermined in accordance with, the regulations.\n(6) Where an appropriate amount is set by virtue of paragraph (a) of\nsubsection (5), the amount of the relevant costs incurred on\ncarrying out the works or under the agreement which may be taken\ninto account in determining the relevant contributions of tenants is\nlimited to the appropriate amount.\n(7) Where an appropriate amount is set by virtue of paragraph (b) of\nthat subsection, the amount of the relevant contribution of the\ntenant, or each of the tenants, whose relevant contribution would\notherwise exceed the amount prescribed by, or determined in\naccordance with, the regulations is limited to the amount so\nprescribed or determined.]\nSection 20B\n(1) If any of the relevant costs taken into account in determining the\namount of any service charge were incurred more than 18 months\nbefore a demand for payment of the service charge is served on the\ntenant, then (subject to subsection (2)), the tenant shall not be\nliable to pay so much of the service charge as reflects the costs so\nincurred.\n(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply if, within the period of 18 months\nbeginning with the date when the relevant costs in question were\nincurred, the tenant was notified in writing that those costs had\nbeen incurred and that he would subsequently be required under\nthe terms of his lease to contribute to them by the payment of a\nservice charge.\n5\n\nSection 21B\n(1) A demand for the payment of a service charge must be\naccompanied by a summary of the rights and obligations of tenants\nof dwellings in relation to service charges.\n(2) The Secretary of State may make regulations prescribing\nrequirements as to the form and content of such summaries of\nrights and obligations.\n(3) A tenant may withhold payment of a service charge which has been\ndemanded from him if subsection (1) is not complied with in\nrelation to the demand.\n(4) Where a tenant withholds a service charge under this section, any\nprovisions of the lease relating to non-payment or late payment of\nservice charges do not have effect in relation to the period for\nwhich he so withholds it.\n(5) Regulations under subsection (2) may make different provision for\ndifferent purposes.\n(6) Regulations under subsection (2) shall be made by statutory\ninstrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a\nresolution of either House of Parliament.\n6\n\nDISPUTED SERVICE CHARGES\nYEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018\nCase Reference: Premises: Flat 2 Mistral Court, 62\nLON/00AH/LSC/2025/0786 Leslie Park\nRoad, CR0 6TP\nFreeholder’s claim - £1,009.98\n(being the balance of 2nd half of the year.

At the conclusion of our substantive decision in this matter dated 2nd\nJuly 2025, we gave directions for determination of the tenants’\napplication under section 20C of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.\nSubsequent directions were given and the parties have provided (a) the\nlandlord’s submissions as to why such an order should not be made, (b)\nthe tenants’ answer and (c) the landlord’s reply.\n2. Unfortunately, due to an internal email going missing, the three\ndocuments were not sent to the members of the Tribunal timeously. This\nhas caused a delay in determining this issue, for which we apologise.\n3. Section 20C, so far as material, provides:\n“(1) A tenant may make an application for an order that all or any\nof the costs incurred, or to be incurred, by the landlord in\nconnection with proceedings before… the First-tier Tribunal… are\nnot to be regarded as relevant costs to be taken into account in\ndetermining the amount of any service charge payable by the\ntenant or any other person or persons specified in the application.\n(2) The application shall be made—…\n(ba) in the case of proceedings before the First-tier\nTribunal, to the tribunal;…\n(3) The… tribunal to which the application is made may make\nsuch order on the application as it considers just and equitable in\nthe circumstances.”\n4. It will be recalled that there were four invoices in dispute before us. We\nallowed the first invoice for £1,500, but disallowed the other three\ninvoices for £2,700 (the VAT on this was not claimed), £3,240 and\n£6,000. The tenants have thus won to a substantial extent. Indeed,\nbecause of technical issues as to service of the service charge demands,\nthe liability in respect of the first invoice was only established after\nproceedings had begun.\n5. The main point made by the landlord is that the tenants adopted an\nunreasonable position in relation to the first invoice. They were\nunreasonable in not accepting the recoverability of this invoice. Thus the\ncost of coming to the Tribunal would have been incurred in any event.\nThe fact that the landlord lost on the other three invoices should not\nmean that the Tribunal should interfere with the landlord’s contractual\nright to recover its costs.\n6. The tenants (understandably) emphasise their overall success, but they\nalso now submit that they always accepted that they were liable for one\nor other of the reports obtained by the landlord. That was not, however,\ntheir position before us. As can be seen from para 16 of our substantive\ndetermination, they were arguing that they were not liable for the first\nreport at all.\n2\n\n7. In our judgment, there is some force in the landlord’s submission that it\nwould have had to come to the Tribunal in any event. However, there is\nalso force in the tenants’ submission that they are the overall winners.\n8. The most just and equitable outcome in our judgment is that a section\n20C order should be made but limited to half of the landlord’s costs.\nDECISION\nHalf of the costs incurred, by the landlord in connection with\nproceedings before this Tribunal are not to be regarded as relevant\ncosts to be taken into account in determining the amount of any\nservice charge payable by the tenants or any of them.\nSigned: Judge Adrian Jack Dated: 13th November 2025\n3"

Deputy District Judge Adams sitting in the County Court at Canterbury\nmade an order dated 23 August 2018 directing that the First–tier\nTribunal (Property Chamber) should;\na. Approve the form of conveyance\nb. Determine the price which would be payable for the Defendant’s\nfreehold interest in the Premises in accordance with Schedule 6\nof the 1993 Act if the interest was being acquired in pursuance of\na notice under section 13 of the 1993 Act, in accordance with\nSection 27(5)(b) of the 1993 Act\nc. Any amounts due in accordance with section 27(5)(b) of the\n1993 Act.\n2. Directions were made on 12 October 2018 indicating that the\napplication would be dealt with on the papers unless an objection was\nreceived.\n3. No objection has been received and the matter is therefore determined\non the bundle provided by the applicant which includes an expert\nreport dated 6 November 2018 from Jeremy Parkin MRICS which\nvalues the premium to be paid at £6,000.\n4. The Tribunal has not inspected the property.\nEvidence\nValuation\n5. Mr Parkin’s expert report describes the property as a four-storey end of\nterrace house which has been converted to provide 3 self-contained\nflats as follows;\na. Not inspected but the accommodation is assumed to be the same\nas Flat 2 with one bedroom. In addition, there is an external\namenity area comprising a courtyard.\nb. A ground floor flat with access from the communal entrance hall.\nHallway, kitchen/lounge/diner 4.8mx3.0m, bedroom 3.1m x\n2.5m with doors to a balcony, bathroom 2.8m x 1.4m.\n2\n\nc. Accessed from the communal hallway via stairs leading to the\nfirst-floor landing. Lounge/kitchen/diner 4.2m x 3.1m with en-\nsuite shower room 2.6m x 0.7m. half landing, utility room 1.0m\nx 0.7m. Second floor landing, bedroom 3.9m x 2.1m, bathroom\n2.1m x 1.9m.\n6. There is no garage or off-street parking.\n7. The three leases are on similar terms and are all for 125 years from 1\nJanuary 2006 each with an initial ground rent of £100 per annum\nincreasing by £100 per annum every 25 years.\n8. Mr Parkin says that he has been informed that Flat 2 has had the\nkitchen upgraded, a new shower installed and new electric heaters\nwithin the two years since June 2016. In addition, the balcony was\ninstalled. To reflect these improvements, he makes an allowance of\n£5,000.\n9. He is also advised that Flat 3 has had similar improvements together\nwith the creation of an en-suite shower room. To reflect these\nimprovements, he allows £7,500.\n10. As he has been unable to inspect Flat 1 he makes no allowance for\nimprovements.\n11. Mr Parkin refers to the following comparables;\n1 Bedroom flats\na. Flat 1, 44 Hardres Street, Ground floor, 125-year lease, sold STC\nfor £121,000\nb. Flat 4, Gina Court, 22 Victoria Road, Ground floor,99 years\nremaining, sold STC for £115,000\nc. 97 King Street, top floor, 99 years remaining, sold STC £107,000\n2 Bedroom flats\nd. Flat 1,65-67 King Street, Ground floor, 83 years remaining, sold\nSTC £102,000\ne. 20 Loughborough Court, Sussex Street, second floor, 88 years\nremaining, sold STC £118,000\nf. 18 Dormans Yard, Victoria Road, en suite bathroom, first\nfloor,115 years remaining, sold STC £125,000\nFreehold sales\ng. Barber Court, 14-16 Harold Rd Cliftonville. 8 flats with ground\nrents of £250 each rising by £250 every 25 years sold at auction\non 29 October 2018 for £36,000 reflecting a yield of 5.56%\nh. 103 High Street, Herne Bay. Three flats producing £350 per\nannum sold at auction on 20 September 2018 for £7,000\nreflecting a yield of 5%.\n3\n\ni. Harold Mews, 39 Harold Rd Margate. Ground rent of £1,100 per\nannum, sold 19 April 2018 for £35,000. Initial yield 3.14% but\nenhanced by reversions with 71 years unexpired.\nj. 21 Canonbury Rd, Ramsgate. Four flats with 125-year leases\nfrom 1/1/2004 producing £150 per flat. Sold 30 October 2017\nfor £12,000 reflecting a yield of 5%.\n12. Based on his comparable Mr Parkin considers the market values of the\nlong leasehold interests in the flats are;\na. £95,000\nb. £110,000\nc. £115,000\n13. After deducting for the improvements referred to in paragraphs 8 and 9\nhe arrives at adjusted market values of;\na. £95,000\nb. £105,000\nc. £107,500\n14. Confirming that his valuation is in accordance the Leasehold and\nCommonhold Reform Act 1993 he capitalizes the ground rent income at\n5% though does not give reasons for his choice.\n15. On this basis he is of the opinion that the value to the Freeholder of the\nleasehold interests to the flats are;\na. £1,995\nb. £1,975\nc. £1,985\n16. Worked valuation sheets are provided for each Flat indicating how he\narrives at his valuations. In each case he values the “Ground Rent\nValue” and arrives at sums for Flats 1,2 & 3 of £3,913, £3,955 and\n£3,965 respectively. He then considers the marriage value which as he\nvalues both the unextended and extended leases at the same amounts\nresults in minus figures for marriage value. Adding these minus\namounts to the “Ground Rent Values” results in the reduced amounts\nshown at paragraph 15 above.\n17. He then goes on to say that if the property were to be placed at auction\nit would attract an all risks yield of 5% on the current ground rent\nincome of £300 giving a valuation of £6,000.\nTerms of Transfer\n18. A draft TR1 is in the bundle at pages 230 to 231.\n4\n\nCosts\n19. The Tribunal’s directions required a statement regarding the Tribunal’s\njurisdiction and details of the costs claimed.\n20. In the applicant’s statement paragraph 3 of the Court’s Order of 21\nAugust 2018 is set out\n“3. The Defendant do pay the Claimants’ costs of this\nApplication summarily assessed by the Court in the sum of\n£4,805.72, together with the Claimants’ reasonable costs of and\noccasioned by the application or applications to the Leasehold\nValuation Tribunal under section 27 of the 1993 Act”\n21. The costs occasioned by the application to the Tribunal are said to be\n£3,635.30 including VAT and disbursements made up as;\na. £1,800 in respect of all legal fees invoiced to date\nb. £780 in respect of all valuation costs invoiced to date\nc. £705.30 in respect of all unbilled legal costs\nd. £350 in respect of the anticipated legal costs of lodging the\nbundle, considering the Tribunal’s determination and reporting\nto the Applicants.\n22. Copies of the invoices and time sheets have been supplied which cover\nthe period from 22 August to 21 October 2018 together with projected\ncosts from 22 October onwards.\nDecision\nValuation\n23. The Tribunal accepts the majority of Mr Parkin’s valuation up to the\npoint where he deducts the negative marriage values from the value of\nthe reversions. No reasons are given for this deduction and the\nTribunal is not satisfied that it is correct to do so.\n24. The Tribunal therefore adopts Mr Parkin’s valuations as referred to in\nparagraph in paragraph 16 above;\n1. £3,913\n2. £3,955\n3. £3,965\nTotal £11,833\n25. The Tribunal therefore determines that the price to be paid\nfor the freehold interest is £11,833.\n5\n\nCosts\n26. The Tribunal is conscious that the Order of Deputy District Judge\nAdams does not specifically require the tribunal to determine the\napplicant’s costs. However, as the determination of such costs are\nmatters which fall within the Tribunal’s regular jurisdiction it has\nundertaken the task.\n27. The Tribunal has considered the evidence of legal and other costs\nincurred or to be incurred and determines that the appropriate amount\nis the sum claimed; £3,635.30.\n28. The net sum to be paid into court is therefore £11,833 less the\nsummarily assessed Court costs of £4,805.72 and the costs of\n£3,635.30 referred to above. The amount remaining is therefore\n£3,391.98.\nTR1\n29. The draft TR1 is approved subject to the following amendments;\na. Panel 8; Delete the receipt by the transferor and insert “The sum\nof £3,391.98 (three thousand three hundred and ninety-one\npounds and ninety-eight pence) has been paid into Court.\nb. Panel 12; Add “Signed as a Deed by the officer of the Court\nnominated to execute this deed on behalf of George Satanas in\naccordance with the Order of the Court dated 23 August 2018.”\nD Banfield FRICS 28 November 2018\nPERMISSION TO APPEAL\n1. A person wishing to appeal the decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written\napplication to the First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has\nbeen dealing with the case.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the\nTribunal sends to the person making the application written reasons\nfor the decision.\n6\n\n3. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to\nappeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide\nwhether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission\nto appeal to proceed.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state\nthe result the party making the application is seeking.\n7"

This has been a paper decision which has been consented to\nby the applicants. The documents that were referred to, is in a bundle of\ntwo volumes which extends to 195 pages prepared by the applicants,\nplus the Tribunals Directions, the contents of which we have recorded.\nTherefore, the tribunal had before it an electronic/digital trial bundles\nof documents prepared by the applicants, in accordance with previous\ndirections.\n2. The tribunal did not inspect the property as it considered the\ndocumentation and information before it in the trial bundle enabled the\ntribunal to proceed with this determination\n3. The application\n1. On 30th December 2021, Jade Wilson of Lease Law Ltd\nsolicitors issued a Part 8 Claim in Bromley County Court under claim\nnumber HO1BR712 seeking a vesting order under section 50(1) of the\nLeasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (‘the\nAct’).This is therefore the date of valuation and we shall return to this\nmatter later in this decision.\n2. On 21st February 2022 the District Judge Brooks made an\norder in the matter subject to the various terms set out in that order\n3. The applicants’ representatives were unable to locate Mr\nGeorge Ernest Ellis.\n4. In accordance with the Vesting Order the application was\nsubmitted to the First Tier Property Tribunal and directions were\nissued on 10th October 2022. These provided that the case would\nproceed to a paper determination. The applicants have not objected to\nthis or requested an oral hearing. The paper determination took place\non 7th December 2022.\n5. In accordance with the directions, the applicants’ solicitors\nsupplied the Tribunal with a well prepared and helpful bundle that\ncontained copies of relevant documents from the County Court\nproceedings, various title documents, the two existing leases and a\n3\n\ncomprehensive Expert Witness valuation report of Mr Stephen R Jones\nBA (Hons) MRICS dated 24th November 2021.\n6. The relevant legal provisions are set out in the appendix to\nthis decision.\nThe background\n7. The leasehold interests in the two flats is now registered in\nnames of the applicants by virtue of a transfer for the ground floor flat\nmade on 17th August 2016 under Title No TGL19257 and the first floor\nflat dated 11th November 2011 under Title No SGL497715. The freehold\nof the building has been registered in the name of George Ernest Ellis\nunder title number 419407 since the 18th December 1986.\n8. The property is a mid terrace Victorian property located in an\nestablished residential area converted to form two self contained flats\napproached via a communal hallway. Each flat has one bedroom and\nthe ground floor has the front and rear gardens included within the\ndemise Each flat has not been subject to any significant internal\nalterations.\n9. The issues\n10. The Tribunal is required to determine the premium to be\npaid for the freehold interest of the 1993 Act and the appropriate sum\nto be paid into Court pursuant to section 27(1)-(7) of the Act.\n11. The Tribunal is required to consider the terms of acquisition.\n12. The Tribunal did not consider that an inspection of the flat\nwas necessary under current circumstances, nor would it have been\nproportionate to the issues in dispute.\n13. Having studied the various documents in the applicant’s\nbundle, the Tribunal has made the determination set out below.\nThe sum to be paid into court\n14. We determine that the premium payable under the 1993 Act\nis £12,690 (Twelve thousand six hundred and ninety pounds) and this\nis the appropriate sum to be paid into Court under section 27(1). Our\nreasons are set out as follows.\n15. In his report, Mr Jones valued the premium at £12,690\n(£6511 ground floor flat, £6079 first floor flat and £100 communal\nareas) This was based on Freehold values of £360,00 for the ground\n4\n\nfloor flat and £325,000 for the first floor flat. A capitalisation rate of\n6%, and a deferment rate of 5%. Mr Jones used the 24th November\n2021 as the valuation date (the date of the report) However, he\ncorrectly stated in his report the actual valuation date would be the date\nof Claim being the 30th December 2021. In view of the fact there is\napproximately one months differential this Tribunal accepts the figures\nin the report. This provided an unexpired term of 90.1 years for each\nflat.\n16. At that date, the lease had an unexpired term of 90.1 years.\nThe Tribunal agrees, in view of the fact, the lease has an unexpired term\nof greater than 80 years marriage value is deemed not to exist.\n17. Having carefully scrutinised the valuation report, including\nthe comparable evidence, the Tribunal agrees the capitalisation and\ndeferment rates and long lease value.\n18. The Tribunal examined the six comparables provided in the\nreport, Each of the properties are located in close proximity to the\nsubject flat. Each comparable is a converted one bedroom flat in\nvarious condition. It would good practice on behalf of the Valuer to\nprepare a schedule which makes valuation adjustments in order to\nprovide a precise methodology. Such adjustments would take into\naccount location, internal specification, onsite parking, private garden,\nfloor area and indexation for time lapse in comparison (already\nundertaken) with the valuation date. No such schedule was provided by\nMr Jones and the Tribunal is somewhat baffled how the two freehold\nvaluation figures were determined., However, despite these minor\nmisgivings, based upon the comparable evidence the Tribunal agrees\nwith the two freehold value of £360,000 and £325,000.\n19. There was no evidence of any ground rent or service charge\narrears for the Flats. In the absence of such evidence, the Tribunal\ndetermines that no additional sums are payable under the 1993 Act. It\nfollows that the appropriate sum to be paid into Court is £12,690 in\naccordance with the valuation report.\nTerms of the Transfer\n20. We have considered the Transfer of the whole registered title\nincorporating the TR1. We are satisfied that the terms should be\napproved as drafted.\nName: Mr D Jagger MRICS Date: 7th December 2022\n5\n\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1.

The Applicant seeks an order that a breach of covenant or a condition\nin the lease has occurred pursuant to Section 168(4) of the\nCommonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. The application\nconcerns alleged breaches at Flat 40 Viscount House, 8 Lakeside\nDrive London NW10 7GS (“the property”).\n2. Section 168 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002\nprovides as follows with sub-section (4) shown in bold:\n(1) A landlord under a long lease of a dwelling may not serve a\nnotice under section 146(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (c.\n20) (restriction on forfeiture) in respect of a breach by a tenant\nof a covenant or condition in the lease unless subsection (2) is\nsatisfied.\n(2) This subsection is satisfied if—\n(a)it has been finally determined on an application under\nsubsection (4) that the breach has occurred,\n(b)the tenant has admitted the breach, or\n(c)a court in any proceedings, or an arbitral tribunal in\nproceedings pursuant to a post-dispute arbitration agreement,\nhas finally determined that the breach has occurred.\n(3) But a notice may not be served by virtue of subsection (2)(a)\nor (c) until after the end of the period of 14 days beginning with\nthe day after that on which the final determination is made.\n(4) A landlord under a long lease of a dwelling may\nmake an application to a leasehold valuation tribunal\nfor a determination that a breach of a covenant or\ncondition in the lease has occurred.\n(5) But a landlord may not make an application under\nsubsection (4) in respect of a matter which—\n(a)has been, or is to be, referred to arbitration pursuant to a\npost-dispute arbitration agreement to which the tenant is a\nparty,\n(b)has been the subject of determination by a court, or\n2\n\n(c)has been the subject of determination by an arbitral tribunal\npursuant to a post-dispute arbitration agreement.\n3. The Applicant, a social landlord, owns the head-lease of the property.\nA Shared Ownership Lease with a term of 251 years was executed by the\nApplicant and the Respondent on 20th April 2022.\n4. The property which is the subject of this application is a two bedroom\nflat with a balcony on the fourth floor of a relatively new development\nknown as Regency Heights.\nThe hearing\n5. The Applicant was represented by Mr Michael Mullin of Counsel. Also\nattending on behalf of the applicant were Leanne Madden, Tenancy\nFraud Investigator, and Ioana Ezaru.\n6. The Respondent did not attend, nor has he engaged in proceedings.\n7. The Applicant gave evidence that it had sent the application to the\nRespondent by a number of means.\n8. On 21 January 2025, the Applicant’s representative wrote to the\nRespondent by letters addressed to 17 Marston Walk (believed to be his\ncurrent address) and Flat 40 Viscount House (the Property address)\nenclosing a copy of the application made to the Tribunal for a\ndetermination of breaches of the lease. Both letters were sent by first\nclass post and special delivery.\n9. The letter was also sent by email to enquiries@aimpropertydesign.com,\nbeing an email contact the Applicant had for the Respondent.\n10. The letter sent to Flat 40 Viscount House and enclosures was later\nreturned to sender as “not collected.”The email to sent to\nenquiries@aimpropertydesign.com was returned as undelivered.\n11. On 4 February 2025, the Applicant’s Representative wrote to the\nRespondent with a further copy of the application and to alert him to the\nforthcoming proceedings. These were sent by email only to\naimexcursions@gmail.com a further email address provided by the\nApplicant.\n12. On 25 April 2025, the Applicant’s Representatives emailed the Tribunal\nand the Respondent providing the relevant titles. The Applicant’s\nrepresentative received a message that the email to\nenquiries@aimpropertydesign.com had not been delivered.\n3\n\n13. On 28 April 2025, the Applicants Representatives therefore sent a\nfurther email to the Respondent at aimexcursions@gmail.com, again\nproviding the relevant titles.\n14. On 2 May 2025, the Applicant’s Representatives subsquently emailed\nthe Respondent at email addresses aceismaurice@gmail.com (an email\naddress provided by the Applicant and associated with the Respondent)\nand enquiries@aimpropertydesign.com providing the Respondent with\nleasehold titles and the Applicant’s evidence.\n15. On 16 June 2025, the Applicant’s Representative wrote to the Tribunal\nby email enquiring if the Tribunal had received any correspondence or\nengagement from the Respondent as they had received no response. The\nApplicant’s representative attached the Directions for ease of reference.\nThe Respondent was copied into this email with his following known\nemail addresses: aimexcursions@gmail.com, aceismaurice@gmail.com\nand enquiries@aimpropertydesign.com.\n16. The Applicant’s Representative again received an alert in response to this\nemail that the email address enquiries@aimpropertydesign.com had\nbeen unable to be delivered.\n17. The Applicant’s Representatives have not received any alerts or\n“undelivered” responses in respect of email addresses\naimexcursions@gmail.com or aceismaurice@gmail.com. As these email\naddresses are known to belong to the Respondent, the Applicant believes\nthey have been received by him.\n18. The Applicant also informed the tribunal that the Respondent had\nattended its offices in the last week to ask for a form for permission to\nsublet. That form has not been returned to the Applicant.\n19. The tribunal considered using its powers under rule 34 of its procedural\nrules.\n20. Rule 34 provides as follows:\nIf a party fails to attend a hearing the Tribunal may proceed with the hearing if\nthe Tribunal—\n(a)is satisfied that the party has been notified of the hearing or that reasonable\nsteps have been taken to notify the party of the hearing; and\n(b)considers that it is in the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing.\nThe decision of the tribunal\n4\n\n21. The tribunal determined that the Respondent had been notified of the\nhearing and that it was in the interests of justice to proceed with the\nhearing.\nThe reasons for the decision of the tribunal\n22. The Respondent was fully aware of the hearing date, and it is in the\ninterests of justice to determine the application as the Applicant has\nspent extensive time and resources preparing its application. There is\nnothing to indicate that if the matter was adjourned the Respondent\nwould attend.\nThe issue\n23. The only issue for the Tribunal to decide is whether a breach of\ncovenant or a condition in the lease has occurred pursuant to S. 168(4)\nof the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. At the CMH the\nprimary allegation of breach by the Respondent was identified as\nparting with possession or subletting the property since at least around\nMay 2023.\n24. The relevant clause of the lease is the alienation clause which provides\nas follows\n(i) Clause 3.19(a) provides that the Respondent shall\n“Not to assign, underlet, charge, mortgage or part\nwith possession of part only of the Premises.”\n(ii) Clause 3.19(b) provides that the Respondent shall\n“Not to underlet or part with possession of the whole\nof the Premises before Final Staircasing has been\naccomplished.”\n(iii) Clause 3.19(c) provides that the Respondent shall\n“Not without the prior written consent of the\nLandlord (such consent not to be unreasonably\nwithheld and which shall be deemed withheld in\ncircumstances where Clause 3.20 is not complied\nwith) to assign the whole of the Premises before\nFinal Staircasing has been accomplished”\nThe evidence of the Applicant\n25. The Applicant alleges that the Respondent owns three shared ownership\nleases.\n5\n\n26. The Applicant was initially alerted to the possibility of subletting due to\nreceiving several key fob requests for the Property. The Applicant\nreceived repeated requests from the Respondent, but also persons who\nwere not authorised to make such requests and were not the Respondent.\nIn May 2023, the Applicant sent new fobs to the Respondent, he claimed\nnot to have received them and alleged that he had no access to his\nmailbox as they were all taped up.\n27. On 14 July 2023 the Applicant received reports from a neighbouring\nresident, that for the past 8 months the Respondent had sublet the\nproperty to 2 females on a permanent basis and there had been no sign\nof the Respondent. It was reported that the two females had since moved\nout, however “candidates” were being shown around the Property.\n28. On or around 28 July 2023, the Respondent had requested for his\ncorrespondence to be diverted to another address. A resident confirmed\nthey had not ever seen the Respondent at the Property.\n29. On 28 July 2023, a credit check was carried out through the National\nAnti-Fraud Network (“NAFN”) credit report by the Applicant. Another\nperson was registered on the Council Tax alongside the Respondent,\ncalled Miss Aderonke Grace Adegbanke. The NAFN report shows Miss\nAdegbanke as a “co-resident”. The Respondent was not registered on the\nelectoral role.\n30. On 25 September 2023, the Applicant received an email from Ms\nMagdeline Dhladhla, who alleged that the Respondent had an illegal\ncontract with them saying they could short let the Property. She alleged\nthe Respondent is “again” renting out the property. She also stated she\nwas taking legal action against him. Ms Dhladhla provided an Assured\nShorthold tenancy agreement, which stated it started on 1 May 2023 and\nended on 1 May 2025. The parties are stated as “the landlord” whose\naddress is 17 Marston Walk and the tenant is S Watson of 29 Lawn\nGardens W7 3J (“17 Marston Walk”). The agreement sets out a monthly\nrent of £2,400.\n31. On 7 November 2023, the Applicant was copied into an email to the\nRespondent from a Sylvia Alswell (aka Sylvia Swatson). She provided a\ncopy of a money claim by Cleanstart Resources Ltd that had purportedly\nbeen made against the Respondent and another Defendant, Shereen\nLeann Strachan. The claim was for a total sum of £12,190.50. Ms Alswell\nhas provided evidence, by virtue of a witness statement dated 1\nDecember 2024, that on 26 January 2023 the Respondent entered into\nan agreement with her for full possession of the Property from 1 May\n2023 to 1 May 2025 this was on the basis she would pay monthly rent\ninstalments of £2400. She paid a deposit of £2400 to the Respondent.\nShe did not take physical possession until 7 July 2023, and then became\naware by the management company that the Property was removed from\n6\n\nAirbnb and was not authorised to be sub-let. Ms Alswell returned the\nkeys of the Property on 31 July 2023 to the Respondent.\n32. The Applicant carried out a land registry search of 17 Marston Walk\nwhich revealed that the Respondent has been the owner of the leasehold\ninterest in this property since 19 February 2021. This is prior to the\nRespondent applying for and becoming a shared owner of the Property.\nThe Applicant understands 17 Marston Walk is also a shared ownership\nproperty, and is owned by Vivid Housing Ltd who are also a Registered\nProvider of Social Housing.\n33. Following a review of internal documents, the Applicant identified that\nthe Respondent provided an address of 51 Burlington Road, New Malden\nKT3 4LP (“51 Burlington Road”) when he signed his mortgage deed for\nthe Property. The Applicant carried out a land registry search of this\naddress and the freehold land is owned by “Maurice Properties Ltd” and\nwas purchased on 2 June 2021, with an address of 1a Wilton Hill Court,\n29 Wilton Road Redhill RH1 6QR. A companies search of Maurice\nProperties Ltd reveals the company’s nature of business is “buying and\nselling of own real estate” and “management of real estate on a fee or\ncontract basis”. The registered office of Maurice Properties Ltd was\nchanged to 33 Rannock Avenue London NW9 7LD on 20 September 13\n2024. The sole company director is Kavitha Maurice. The Respondent is\nnot mentioned on the title, but has previously had links to the Property.\n34. The Applicant is aware that the Respondent has a shared ownership lease\nat Flat 16 Lysander House, 7 Union Way, NW10 6FJ (“Flat 16 Lysander\nHouse”) with Notting Hill Genesis (another Registered Provider of Social\nHousing) since 12 July 2022. The Applicant has been able to obtain the\napplication form the Respondent completed when applying for Flat 16\nLysander House. This provides the Respondent’s “current address” as 51\nBurlington Road. The application states the Respondent had been a full\ntime employee of Notting Hill Genesis for a year at the time of the\napplication. The Respondent has electronically signed the application on\n26 November 2021, and does not appear to have made any disclosures\nabout the Property he owns at 17 Marston Walk.\n35. On 17 July 2024, the Applicant carried out a credit search of the\nRespondent at the Property. This revealed the Respondent is still not on\nthe electoral role at the Property. The only account linked to the Property\nin respect of the Respondent is the mortgage which the Respondent\nobtained with Kensington Mortgages. This revealed that the following\npeople were “co-residents” from 2021 – 2024\n(i) Miss Aderonke Grace Adegbanke\n(ii) Ms Anuradha Anuradha\n7\n\n(iii) Mr Prakash Chandra\n36. Also on 17 July 2024, the Applicant carried out a credit search of the\naddresses it was aware from its investigations that were linked to the\nRespondent, namely 17 Marston Walk, 51 Burlington Road and 16\nLysander Close. The results revealed as follows:-\n(i) For tracing purposes the Respondent is known at 51\nBurlington Road from 28 October 2003 – 1\nDecember 2020. The Respondent was also on the\nelectoral role during the same period at this address.\nThere appears to be some live credit at the address\nand most recently a loan taken out in June 2024. The\ncredit report mentions “Kavitha Maurice”.\n(ii) In respect of 17 Marston Walk, the Respondent has\nbeen known at the address for tracing purposes from\n13 February 2021 – to date. The Respondent does not\nappear on the electoral role. The following\nindividuals are also linked to the Property, Miss\nMercy Ayandiba Agbango, Mr Enoch Amoasi and\nPrince Amoasi. There is a shared Ownership\nmortgage with One Savings Bank - Kent Reliance for\n£53,000 and a number of live credit accounts at the\naddress.\n(iii) In respect of Flat 16, Lysander House, it states the\nRespondent is currently linked to the Property along\nwith Miss Magdeline Mokgerwane Dhladhla. There is\na mortgage for £88k in the Respondents’ name with\nLeeds Building Society.\n37. On 31 July 2024, the local authority fraud team confirmed to the\nApplicant that the person currently liable for the Council Tax at the\nProperty as from 1 September 2023 is Prakash Chandra. It was also\nnoted that Prakash Chandra was in receipt of single occupier discount\nwith regards to their Council Tax account as from 1 September 2023. The\nlocal authority fraud team confirmed that the Respondent was liable for\nthe Council Tax at the above address for the period 20/04/22 –\n31/08/23. No single occupier discount had been applied.\n38. On 22 August 2024, the Applicant carried out a tenancy audit by an\nofficer visiting the Property and found the following people present at\nthe Property: Prakesh Chandra, Anuradha Anuradhia and Shivalika\nChandi. Mr Chandra has confirmed that he has lived at the Property for\n8 months and the landlord is the Respondent. He stated that he paid a\ndeposit of £300 and pay £1700 per month in direct debit to the\nRespondent’s bank account. He stated the initial agreement was to rent\none room for £1000 per month but they then rented out the whole of the\n8\n\nProperty for £1700 for the last 4-5 months. He states he found the\nproperty online. He stated his mother in law pays the Respondent the\nrent so he does not have their bank details. The agreement is stated as\nbeing between “the landlord”, the Respondent of 17 Marston Walk and\nthe tenant “Prakash Chandra”. The tenancy agreement states it\ncommences on 1 September 2023.\n39. The Applicant has thoroughly investigated and concluded the\nRespondent has parted with possession of the Property. The Respondent\nowns three shared ownership leases. It is not possible for him to reside\nin all of the properties and it appears he may not ever have taken up\noccupation of the Property as his only or principal home. Even if he had,\nhe has permanently parted with possession of the whole of the Property\nfor a substantial period of time.\n40. The Respondent has sublet the Property and as such is in breach of the\nLease, and also has failed to disclose to the Applicant his other property\ninterests when purchasing the Property. Had the Applicant been aware\nof the Respondent’s property ownership elsewhere he would not have\nbeen approved for a shared ownership lease.\nThe Tribunal’s decision\n41.

Following an objection from the Tenant to the determination of a fair rent by the\nO\nRent Officer, the Tribunal has made a determination under the provisions of the Rent Act\nL\n1977.\nD\nR\nFR27\nE\nF\nO\n\nInspection\n2. The Tribunal did not inspect the property but considered this case on the basis of\nthe papers provided by the parties.\nEvidence\n3. The Tribunal has consideration of the written submissions provided by the Tenant.\nThere were no written submissions from the Landlord.\nDetermination and Valuation\n4. Having consideration of our own expert, general knowledge of rental values in the area,\nwe consider that the open market rent for the property in good tenantable condition would\nbe in the region of £650 per week. From this level of rent we have made adjustments in\nrelation to:\nLease terms – repair and decoration obligations on the Tenant\nNo white goods, floor coverings, curtains\nNo central heating\nCondition\n5. The Tribunal has also made an adjustment for scarcity.\n6. The valuation is shown below:\nper week\nMarket Rent £650\nLess\nLease terms )\nNo white goods, floor coverings, curtains)\nNo central heating )\nCondition ) approx. 35%\n£227.50\n£422.50\nLess\nScarcity approx. 20% £84.50\n£338.00\n7. The Tribunal determines a rent of £338.00 per week.\nDecision\n8. The uncapped fair rent initially determined by the Tribunal, for the purposes of section\n70, was £338.00 per week. The capped rent for the property according to the provisions of\nthe Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 is calculated at £303.00 per week. The\ncalculation of the capped rent is shown on the decision form. In this case the lower rent of\n£303.00 per week is to be registered as the fair rent for this property.\nChairman: Mr A Parkinson Date: 20 January 2025\nFR27\n\nAPPEAL PROVISIONS\nThese summary reasons are provided to give the parties an indication as to how the\nTribunal made its decision. If either party wishes to appeal this decision, they should first\nmake a request for full reasons and the details of how to appeal will be set out in the full\nreasons.

It has amended paragraphs 49\nand 61 of the decision and pages 8 and 11 of the schedule, following that\nreview. The amendments are all crossed through or underlined.\nCovid-19 pandemic: description of hearing\nThis decision was made following a remote video hearing, which none of the\nparties objected to. The form of remote hearing was V: CVPREMOTE. A face-\nto-face hearing was not held due to the current lockdown restrictions and all\nissues could be reasonably determined at a remote hearing. The Tribunal was\nreferred to various documents, as detailed at paragraphs 7-9 below, the\ncontents of which were noted.\nDecision of the Tribunal\n(A) This decision supplements the Tribunal’s decisions dated 05\nDecember 2018 (‘the 2018 Decision’) and 09 April 2019 (‘the\n2019 Decision’) and should be read in conjunction with those\ndecisions.\n(B) The Tribunal makes the determinations set out at paragraphs\n39, 40, 61, 81 and 82 of this decision and in the final column\nof the attached Scott Schedule.\nThe background\n1. This application concerns a collective enfranchisement claim under the\nLeasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (‘the\n1993 Act’). Meridian Place is a substantial, mixed use development,\nlocated off Marsh Wall on the Isle of Dogs. The northern boundary is\nadjacent to the Thames Walkway and overlooks South Dock.\n2. The applicant (‘A’) is the nominee purchaser, the First Respondent\n(‘R1’) is the current freeholder and the Second Respondent (‘R2’)\nmanages Meridian Place. The Third Respondent (‘R3’) manages the\nwider estate. R2 and R3 are parties to most of the existing leases.\n3. The Tribunal dealt with a number of legal issues in the 2018 Decision.\nIt then dealt with the price payable for the freehold in the 2019\nDecision. This decision deals with the remaining issues, being the\nfollowing disputed terms in the conveyancing documents:\n(a) the extent of the land to be included in the freehold transfer;\n(b) the terms of the freehold transfer (TP1);\n(c) the terms of the leaseback of Flat 59; and\n2\n\n(d) the terms of the commercial leasebacks.\n4. The Tribunal has issued various directions since the 2019 Decision.\nThe penultimate directions, dated 13 July 2020, required A and R1 to\neach serve a suite of relevant conveyancing documents and plans and\nthen complete a Scott Schedule (‘the Schedule’) with their submissions\non the disputed terms. The completed Schedule was filed with the\nTribunal on 07 October 2020. The final directions, dated 23 October\n2020, required A to file a supplemental (digital) bundle for use at the\nremote hearing, to include the completed Schedule.\nThe hearing\n5. The remaining issues were listed for a remote video hearing on 24 and\n25 November 2020. Ms Muir appeared for A and Mr Rainey appeared\nfor R1, as they had at previous hearings. Also in attendance were Mr\nKevin Kearney (a director of A), Mr Aashu Oberoi (R1’s solicitor) and\nMr Mukarram Sattar (a beneficiary of R1). No-one appeared or\nattended for R2 or R3.\n6. The hearing concluded at 4.30pm on 24 November. The Tribunal\nreconvened on 25 November to make its decision.\n7. The Tribunal was supplied with two supplemental bundles; one from A\nand one from R1, together with skeleton arguments from both counsel\nand bundles of authorities. Judge Donegan also had access to the\nbundles from the previous hearings and six sets of architect’s drawings,\nrelating to the original construction of Meridian Place, showing the first\nto sixth floors.\n8. The evening before the hearing, the case officer received a letter from\nR1’s solicitors with copies of six undated deeds of variation for various\ncommercial units at Meridian Place (see paragraph 64 below). The\nTribunal did not have an opportunity to study these documents before\nthe hearing, due to their late arrival.\n9. During the course of the hearing, Ms Muir referred to the latest\ncorrespondence from R2 and R3, regarding the leaseback of Flat 59,\nnot included in either bundle. These are an email from R3 dated 20\nNovember and a letter from R2, incorrectly dated 27 October 2020 (see\nparagraphs 53 and 55 below). Copies were emailed to the case officer\non 23 November but were only seen by the Tribunal after the hearing.\n10. At the start of the hearing, the Tribunal dealt with two preliminary\nmatters; both arising from R1’s supplemental bundle. This included a\nwitness statement and exhibit from Mr Oberoi dated 13 November\n2020. The statement addressed various issues, including the rear\nboundary of Meridian Place, easements for the commercial leasebacks,\n3\n\nan external staircase for Flat 59 and the leaseback of this flat.\nExhibited to this statement was a short ‘report’ from Mr Jonathan\nWard BA, Dip Arch, RIBA, dated 02 August 2019. This was headed\n“Assessment of Ground floor footprint and site boundary along river\nfrontage” and addressed the footprint of the building at Meridian\nPlace.\n11. Ms Muir objected to the late service of Mr Oberoi’s statement and Mr\nWard’s report. The former was disputed and she wished to cross-\nexamine Mr Oberoi. The latter should not be admitted, as it had been\nproduced in August 2019 but not disclosed until November 2020.\nFurther, there was no permission for expert evidence, it was not a\nformal expert report and had been produced without sight of the\noriginal construction drawings or full access to the basement. Mr\nRainey suggested that Mr Oberoi’s statement could be accepted without\noral evidence. Alternatively, he could tender Mr Oberoi for cross-\nexamination. He explained that Mr Ward’s report was not relied upon\nas expert evidence but would assist the Tribunal in dealing with the\nrear boundary issue.\n12. Having heard submissions on the preliminary issues, the Judge\ndirected that Mr Oberoi give oral evidence. Following a short\nadjournment, the Judge informed the parties that Mr Ward’s report\nwould not be admitted. The report was unsigned, did not include a\nstatement of truth and Mr Ward did not attend the hearing, so could\nnot give oral evidence. Further, the limited terms of reference meant\nthe report would not assist in determining the rear boundary issue.\nRather the Tribunal would rely on the plans and photographs in the\nbundles and the members’ recollection of a site inspection on 16\nOctober 2018.\n13. During the adjournment, the parties agreed some issues and others\nwere agreed during oral submissions. These are noted in this decision\nand the Schedule.\n14. The Judge asked Mr Rainey to take the Tribunal through the undated\ndeeds of variation, given these had been served so late in the day.\nMr Oberoi’s evidence\n15. Mr Oberoi is a partner in R1’s solicitors, Housing and Property Law\nPartnership. He spoke to his statement dated 13 November 2020,\nwhich contained both evidence and legal submissions. Some of the\nevidence was uncontroversial. For example, Mr Oberoi stated there\nwere no obvious changes to the rear boundary during his latest\ninspection on 04 November 2020. He also referred to tables and chairs\noutside the commercial units, which were in place during the Tribunal’s\ninspection.\n4\n\n16. The controversial parts of Mr Oberoi’s evidence largely relate to the\nredevelopment of Flat 59, which is located above the entrance archway.\nAs part of their term and reversion agreement, the parties agreed that\nR1 would take a leaseback of this flat with a right to extend into the\nairspace below. This agreement was recorded in emails passing\nbetween the valuers, Mr Richard Muphy (A) and Mr Ghulam Yasin\n(R1), on 04 October 2018. These are recited below, in chronological\norder:\n“Hi Ghulam\nTo reach agreement I will recommend a settlement of the term and\nreversion calculation based upon a 5.95% Cap Rate and a FHVP of\n£48million for the Reversion. Please confirm your client will accept\nthis.\nRegards,\nRichard Murphy MRICS\nDear Richard\nI am pleased to confirm the components listed in your email below are\nagreed - strictly for the purposes of agreeing a deal. When applied the\npremium is £793,843 for the term and reversion of 90 flats plus s33\ncosts.\nAs you confirmed on the phone, your clients are agreed to my clients\nretaining the right to extend Flat 59 in line with the attached planning\npermission. For completeness, please confirm this in your reply.\nThe remaining issues will be dealt with separately.\nKind regards\nGhulam Yasin BSc MRICS\nDear Ghulam\nMy client agrees to a premium of £793,843 for the specified premises\non the understanding that 90 flats are involved (and not 93) plus S33\nCosts.\nMy client agrees to your client retaining the right to extend Flat 59 in\nline with the attached planning permission and in accordance with\nbuilding regulations in force at the time.\nRegards,\nRichard Murphy MRICS”.\n17. A copy of the relevant planning consent was included in A’s bundle.\nThis was issued by Tower Hamlets Council (‘THC’) on 22 September\n2017 (‘the 2017 Planning Permission’). It is headed “CONDITIONAL\nPERMISSION FOR DEVELOPMENT” and refers to application number\n5\n\nPA/14/02209. The accompanying schedule refers to various\ndocuments and drawings and includes the following description:\n“Proposal: Infill below Flat 59 to enlarge the existing\naccommodation to create a duplex unit. Retention of the\nenlarged duplex accommodation as a self-contained\nthree bedroom flat.”\n18. The planning consent schedule also includes various conditions,\nincluding a requirement that the development commences within three\nyears and that full details of the facing materials be submitted to, and\napproved by, THC prior to commencement.\n19. In his statement, Mr Oberoi explained that R1 has carried out extensive\nworks to the void below Flat 59. He exhibited two photographs,\nshowing the progress of the works as at 04 November 2020, which he\ndescribed as “not that far from completion (save as regards the need\nfor a fire escape)” (paragraph 24). He dealt with the fire escape at\nparagraphs 16 and 17, which are recited below:\n“16. Before I deal with the recent issues over the proposed form of\nleaseback for Flat 59, there is one practical issue that has\narisen. As mentioned below, the First Respondent has almost\ncompleted the works to develop into the airspace below Flat 59.\nIt has become apparent that in order to ensure the completed\nflat is safe as can be and in particular the risk of death or injury\nin the event of fire are minimalised, an external staircase is\nrequired. I exhibit recent correspondence in this regards [5 to\n7]. The First Respondent will say that the extended flat is\nunusual in that the exit is on an upper floor, with no separate\nmeans of escape from the lower floor.\n17. I am instructed that the First Respondent will need planning\npermission for this and once obtained, a staircase will be\nconstructed. The First Respondent will ask that the leaseback\nfor Flat 59 includes an easement of access over such staircase to\nand from the extended flat. At it is not intended that the\nstaircase be demised, its precise location/design need not delay\nthe inclusion of an easement and that such an easement to be:\ni) new clause (F) in the First Schedule, Part II of the First\nRespondent’s amendments in red being the lease Titled “RS1’s\nLEASEBACK ON BASIS WORKS NOT YET COMPLETED 23\nAugust 2020” to the Applicant’s draft lease in black (Item 4 of\nthe Trial Bundle) and/or\nii) new Clause 6 in the First Schedule, Part II of the First\nRespondent’s amendments in read being the lease Titled “RS1’s\nLEASEBACK ON BASIS WORKS COMPLETE 23 August 2020”\nto the Applicant’s draft lease in black (Item 4 of the Trial\nBundle)\nin the following terms\n6\n\n“the full and unfettered right of access and egress to and from\nthe Premises at all times over the external staircase leading to\nthe Premises””.\n20. Also exhibited to Mr Oberoi’s statement were:\n(a) a letter from Assent Building Control Limited (‘ABCL’) to R1\ndated 10 November 2020, recommending a fire escape leading\nfrom the new lower floor of Flat 59 to the ground level; and\n(b) a design review statement from Mr Opeolu Awolesi BEng dated\n10 November 2020, commenting on the proposed fire safety\ndesign of the extended flat.\n21. There were two notable omissions in Mr Oberoi’s statement, being any\nreference to:\n(a) a substantial, external staircase that had already been installed\nbelow Flat 59, which is clearly visible in photographs in A’s\nbundle; and\n(b) a planning application made by Rolfe Judd Planning (‘RJP’) on\n27 August 2020 and refused by THC on 22 October 2020.\nCopies of an application summary and THC’s refusal were\nincluded in the applicant’s bundle. These described the\nproposed work as “Creation of a standalone 2 bedroom\nresidential unit within the void of level 002 of the Meridian\nPlace development accompanied by the introduction of a new\nexternal staircase to act as primary access.” The reasons given\nfor the refusal were:\n“1 – The proposed infill development and external stairwell by\nway of its form, positioning and design would be an\nunsympathetic and incongruous addition to its surrounding\ncontext. It would negatively impact the appearance of the\ndevelopment in which it sits, harm the street scene and damage\nexisting views. This is contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the\nLondon Plan (2016) and policies S.DH1 and D.DH2 of the\nTower Hamlets Local Plan (2020).\n2 – The proposed two-bedroom apartment would not be\nprovided with adequate waste and cycle storage. This is\ncontrary to policy 6.9 of the London Plan (2016) and policies\nD.TR3 and D.MW3 of the Tower Hamlets Local Plan.”\n22. In his oral evidence, Mr Oberoi said the new staircase is not a\npermanent structure and is not fixed. Rather, it is used to transport\nbuilding materials to and from the new structure below Flat 59.\n23. In cross-examination, Mr Oberoi said he only learned of the 2020\nplanning application in the last couple of weeks and was unaware of the\nrefusal until he saw A’s bundle. He confirmed that an external staircase\nwas visible on his inspection on 04 November and “looks similar” to\n7\n\nthat shown in the applicant’s photographs. He had not mentioned the\nstaircase in his statement as he understood it to be a temporary\nstructure for the transportation of materials. He did not consider the\nstaircase worthy of mention and rejected all allegations of impropriety.\n24. In re-examination, Mr Oberoi denied any dishonesty or intention to\nmislead the Tribunal. The need for a fire escape, as referred to in his\nstatement, was based on the advice from ABCL and Mr Awolesi. This\nwas different to the temporary staircase seen in A’s photographs.\n25. On questioning from the Tribunal, Mr Oberoi accepted that means of\nescape would have been considered as part of the 2017 planning\napplication and the 2017 consent does not require a fire escape. His\nunderstanding, based on instructions from R1, is that the 2020\nplanning application had been submitted in error. He had been inside\nthe new structure during his recent inspection. This is an extension to\nFlat 59, rather than a separate flat, albeit the builders are yet to punch\nthrough to connect the two storeys.\n26. Mr Oberoi’s statement also dealt with correspondence from R2 and R3,\nregarding the leaseback of Flat 59, which had been overtaken by their\nmost recent letters (see paragraphs 53 and 55 below). It also addressed\nthe proposed right to place tables and chairs outside the commercial\nunits, stating “In this regard I am informed by Mr Sattar (who\nrepresents the First Respondent and has been involved with the\nproperty for many years) that such use has been enjoyed for\napproximately 15 or so years and certainly during the First\nRespondent’s ownership.” There was no statement or evidence from\nMr Sattar.\n27. The Tribunal found Mr Oberoi to be a credible and honest witness, who\ndid his best to answer the questions put to him. It accepts there was no\nintention to mislead but the failure to mention the 2020 planning\napplication or external staircase (in his statement) was material. The\nstatement post-dated his inspection on 04 November and service of A’s\nbundle and should have addressed both of these issues.\n28. The omissions in Mr Oberoi’s statement may be attributable to\ninadequate or misleading instructions from R1. The Tribunal does not\naccept the 2020 planning application was submitted in error. This is\nhighly improbable and there was no evidence from RJP to support this\nallegation. Further, it is undermined by refusal letter from THC. This\nrefers to the various documents and drawings that accompanied the\napplication, including a shadowing assessment and design and access\nstatement. R1 went to the trouble and expense of obtaining these\nassessments, as well as the drawings and clearly contemplated the\ncreation of a separate flat with external staircase.\n8\n\n29. The Tribunal accepts Mr Oberoi’s evidence that the new structure is an\nextension to Flat 59; rather than a separate flat. It is unnecessary to\ndecide the purpose of the staircase shown in A’s photographs.\nHowever, it is substantial and could become a permanent means of\naccess and escape for the new structure.\nThe issues\n30. Both counsel made detailed oral submissions, expanding on points\nmade in their skeleton arguments. These are summarised below.\nThe land to be included in the transfer\n31. Both parties relied on two plans; Plan A showing the land to be\ntransferred and Plan B showing the land to be retained, subject to\npermanent rights.\n32. Initially there were three areas of dispute on Plan A; the northern\nboundary, stairwells on the east and west sides and the extent of the\nfront entrance steps. The parties agreed the stairwells should be\nexcluded from the transfer and also agreed the extent of the front steps,\nas shown on the attached, modified version of Plan A. The only\nremaining issue was the northern boundary. A contends this should be\na straight line matching the northern boundary on the freehold title\nplan. This would incorporate low level perimeter walls, two structures\nthat house air vents for the basement and all of the rear steps leading to\nthe Thames Walkway. R1 contends there should be two indents for\nnarrow ‘voids’ between the low walls and the flank wall of the building.\nThese are in front of Flats 1 and 2 on the left-hand side and Flats 84\nand 85 on the right, looking from the Thames Walkway. R1 accepts\nthat the vent structures and all of the rear steps should be included but\nsays the voids should be retained.\n33. Ms Muir submitted that the voids were claimed in the section 13 notice,\nas part of the ‘Specified Premises’. Both plans accompanying the notice\nshowed a straight line for the northern boundary of the building. These\nshow the Specified Premises edged red and the other property, to be\nacquired under section 1(2)(a) of the 1993 Act, edged green. There is\nno gap between the red and green lines demarking the northern\nboundary on Plan 1. However, there is a narrow gap on Plan 2. Ms\nMuir submitted that it would have been obvious to the reasonable\nrecipient that the red and green lines were intended to be in the same\nplace on Plan 2, as they were the same on Plan 1. Further, the\nleaseholders would have intended, and were only entitled, to acquire\nthe whole of the Specified Premises. She also pointed out that R1 had\nnot disputed the validity of the s.13 notice.\n9\n\n34. Ms Muir also submitted that the voids are part of the building, as they\nform part of the basement roof. She drew support from the lease plans\nfor Flat 25, which included a basement floor plan. This shows the\nnorthern edge as a straight line with two “outcrops”. She submitted\nthat this must follow the line of the low walls and the bottom of the rear\nsteps; otherwise the steps would trespass onto the Thames Walkway. It\nfollows that the voids must be above the basement. Ms Muir also relied\non the balconies for Flats 1, 2, 84 and 85, which overhang the voids.\nRetention of the voids by R1 would create a flying freehold, with\ndifferent freeholders of the balconies and the voids below.\n35. Mr Rainey explained that no issue was taken on the section 13 plans.\nHe relied on a basement floor plan in the freehold title plans, which\nalso shows the two “outcrops”. These are the vent structures which jut\nout from the rear basement wall, to the north. The low walls are in line\nwith the outer face of these structures and the bottom of the rear steps.\nThe northern edge of the basement is not the edge of the site and there\nis a gap between the two. This means the voids are not above the\nbasement and extend beyond the footprint of the building. R1 wishes\nto retain the voids to prevent any blocking up of grilles at the bottom of\nthe flank walls, which provide air and light to the basement car park.\nAssociated companies have leases of parts of the car park.\n36. Mr Rainey rejected the notion that overhanging balconies create a\nflying freehold, as the balconies are supported by the building. It is\ncommon for balconies to overhang pavements or other land, without\ncausing tenure problems. If the voids are retained then the retained\nareas would only extend up to the underside of the lowest balconies.\n37. During the course of the hearing, the Valuer Member pointed out that\nthe basement foundations, below the northern flank wall, would need\nto be substantial. They support the building above and act as a\nretaining wall for the Thames Walkway and South Dock. This means\nthe foundations may extend out from the flank wall. Mr Rainey\nacknowledged this but suggested the foundations would be extremely\nthick if they are the width of both the wall and the voids.\n38. During the course of the hearing, counsel agreed the extent of A’s\npermanent rights over the retained land. The agreed form of Plan B is\nattached.\nThe Tribunal’s decision\n39. The Tribunal determines that freehold transfer shall include the voids\nand low perimeter walls.\n40. The Tribunal approves the modified version of Plan A attached.\n10\n\nReasons for the Tribunal’s decision\n41. The architect’s drawings relate to the first to sixth floors and do not\nshow the basement. The legend, on each drawing, includes the\nfollowing note:\n“FOUNDATIONS\nThe site is piled with existing piles and additional piles have\nbeen driven (subject to previous application dated 12/03/96).\nA 700mm thick reinforced concrete slab will be cast at\nbasement level with reinforced concrete retaining wall to\nGround floor level. Calculations to be submitted prior to\ncommencement on site.”\nThe Tribunal was not supplied with the original planning consent or\nany calculations, drawings or specification showing the extent of the\nbasement foundations. The lease and title plans show the two\n“outcrops” extending beyond the basement footprint. The Tribunal\nfinds these demark the vent structures and the voids are not above the\nbasement car park, as advanced by Mr Rainey.\n42. The Tribunal does not know the dimensions of the foundations. Based\non the Valuer Member’s knowledge and experience, as a retired\nSurveyor of over 40 years’ standing, it is highly likely that the\nfoundations are wider than the flank wall above. They support a six-\nstorey building and act as the retaining wall for the Thames Walkway\nand South Dock. This is consistent with the legend note in the\narchitect’s drawings.\n43. Based on the limited evidence available and using its own expertise, the\nTribunal concluded that the voids, or a substantial part, are above the\nbasement foundations. These voids are approximately 1 meter wide. It\nis likely that the foundations extend outwards by some distance. Any\n‘gap’ would be minimal and all of the voids are liable to acquisition.\nThis also avoids any potential problems that might arise from the\noverhanging balconies.\nThe terms of the freehold transfer (TP1)\n44. There are three disputed sub-clauses in panel 12 of the draft transfer\ndeed, as detailed in the Schedule. The Tribunal’s decision on each of\nthese clauses, with brief reasons, is to be found in the final column of\nthe Schedule.\n45. In relation to sub-clause 8 and schedule 3, A suggested it was\nunnecessary to include details of the various leasebacks in the transfer.\nRather, these should be dealt with separately in a contract. However,\nA’s suite of conveyancing documents did not include a draft contract\n11\n\nand the Tribunal can only determine the documents before it. In the\nabsence of a contract, sub-clause 8 and schedule 3 should remain.\nThey clarify the transaction and identify the leasebacks to be completed\nsimultaneously with the transfer.\nThe terms of the leaseback of Flat 59\n46. This flat is already subject to a 125-year lease and the current\nleaseholder, The Komoto Group Limited (‘KGL’) is associated with R1.\nThe parties agreed that R1 would take a 999-year leaseback of this flat,\nwith the right to extend, as part of the term and reversion settlement.\n47. R1’s solicitors have drafted two leasebacks; the first assumes the\nextension has not been finished at completion and the second assumes\nit has. The Schedule included submissions on both drafts, as did the\nskeleton arguments. Ms Muir and Mr Rainey asked the Tribunal to\ndetermine both documents, as no-one can say when the works will be\ncompleted. The Tribunal has proceeded on this basis and its decision\non each disputed clause, with brief reasons, is in the final column of the\nSchedule. Its decision on the proposed fire escape easement is at\nparagraph 61 below.\n48. During the course of the hearing, Ms Muir agreed the following\namendments to both leasebacks:\nPrescribed clause LR4 Add “as is more particularly described\nherein” at the end of this clause\n1st schedule part I Substitute “Flat 39 and the Airspace” for\n“the Flat”\n1st schedule part I para 1(b) Add “within the Flat” at the end of this\nclause\n1st schedule part II Add “in respect of the Premises and the\nFlat” at the end of this clause.\n49. When determining these leasebacks, the Tribunal focused on the terms\nagreed by the valuers in October 2018 (‘the October 2018 Agreement’).\nThey are not leasebacks under s.36 of the 1993 Act, as Flat 59 does not\ncome comes within parts II or part III of schedule 9 and a leaseback\nwas requested in the counter-notice. Rather, the The parties have\nagreed there should be a leaseback with the right to extend Flat 59 and\nthe Tribunal must implement the terms of that agreement in\naccordance with paragraph 7 and part IV of schedule 9. Adopting Mr\nRainey’s phraseology, those terms are a “Greenpine term of\nacquisition” within s.24. This is a reference to the decision in\nGreenpine Investment Holding Limited v Howard de\nWalden Estates Ltd [2016] EWHC 1923 (Ch), where the\nleaseholder’s agreement to provide an opinion from a BVI lawyer,\noutside the 1993 Act, was a term of acquisition for the purposes of s.48.\n12\n\n50. The terms of the October 2018 Agreement were that R1 would retain\n“the right to extend Flat 59 in line with the attached planning\npermission and in accordance with the Building regulations in force at\nthe time.” This was a reference to the 2017 Planning Permission for an\ninfill below Flat 59 to enlarge that flat. There was no agreement for the\nconstruction of a separate flat. The reference to “Building regulations\nin force at the time” must mean the Building Regulations in force at the\ntime of construction; rather than time of the agreement.\n51. It is convenient here to address the correspondence from R2 and R3.\nIn a letter to the Tribunal dated 13 December 2018 R3 stated:\n“This letter is confirmation that we are willing to become a party to\nany Leaseback Lease granted pursuant to the above Application and\nacting as the Management Company in the same or similar manner\nas are in the Existing Leases.”\nR2 and R3 then sent identical letters to the Tribunal on 16 January\n2019, asking to be joined to the proceedings and reciting part of\nparagraph 201 of the 2018 Decision. Both letters concluded “The effect\nof the tribunal’s decision will mean that in practice, under any\nleaseback terms, our current obligations will not change and confirm\nthat we do not wish to be separately represented.”\n52. In an email to the Tribunal dated 21 September 2020, Mr Brendon\nHowe of R3 stated (of Flat 59):\n“We would not agree to any Lease that did not mirror the terms of the\nexisting 125-year lease.\nIn particular, any alterations to the Tenant’s Covenants, or any lease\nfor this and other units that do not contain adequate provisions for\nService Charges.”\n53. Mr Howe then sent an email to Mr Kearney dated 20 November 2020,\nin the following terms:\n“To whom it may concern\nThe Management Company agree in principle to a clause, in the\nLeaseback lease of flat 59, permitting the extension of flat 59 in\naccordance with the Planning Consent dated 22nd September 2017\n(PA/14/02209) and conforming to Building Regulations. We do not\nconsent to any other development.\nWe agree with the Applicants Clause 3(8) in the proposed lease, but\nare not prepared to agree to the 1st Respondent’s clauses 6(iii) and\n8(2)(b) or any clause or definition that would allow work other than\nthat permitted by the Planning Consent of 22nd September 2017.”\n54. In a letter to the Tribunal dated 27 October 2020 R2 stated:\n“As this matter is again before the Tribunal in November 2020, we\nwish to restate our position with respect to the terms of any Leaseback\n13\n\nLeases. We would not agree to any lease that does not mirror the\nterms of existing leases and that all leases should contain provisions\nfor service charges.\nIn particular, we would not agree with terms in a lease that appear to\nallow flat 59 to be extended down one floor (to the second floor) to\nform a duplex unit as per the planning consent granted on 22nd\nSeptember 2017 (PA/14/02209) or otherwise.”\n55. R2 sent subsequent letter to the Tribunal, incorrectly dated 27 October\n2020 but received on 23 November 2020, reading:\n“Meridian Gate Estate Management Company Ltd agree in principle\nto a clause, in the Leaseback lease of flat 59, permitting the extension\nof flat 59 in accordance with the Planning Consent dated 22nd\nSeptember 2017 (PA/14/02209) and conforming to Building\nRegulations. We do not consent to any other development.\nWe agree with the Applicants Clause 3(8) in the proposed lease, but\nare not prepared to agree to the 1st Respondent’s clauses 6(iii) and\n8(2)(b) or any clause or definition that would allow work other than\nthat permitted by the Planning Consent of 22nd September 2017.”\n56. In his skeleton argument, Mr Rainey took issue with the\nSeptember/October 2020 correspondence. R2 and R3 were seeking to\nblock the extension to Flat 59, possibly at A’s instigation, by insisting\non a leaseback in the same terms as the existing leases (without a right\nto extend). Further, R2 specifically opposed the downward extension.\nHowever, these objections had been overtaken by the latest email and\nletter, now agreeing a clause permitting the extension.\n57. Ms Muir did not pursue any point arising from the decision in Duval v\n11-13 Randolph Crescent [2020) UKSC 18, which had been\nflagged in pre-hearing correspondence. In her skeleton argument, she\nsaid the issue did not arise as R1 had granted KGL a licence for\nalterations in December 2018. This permitted “the Tenant Works”,\nwhich are defined as:\n“the works to be carried out by the Tenant at the Building for the\npurposes of enlarging Flat 59 by constructing a second floor beneath\nthe existing Flat 59 at the Building brief details of which are set out in\nthe Planning Drawings together with a connection to Utilities at the\nBuilding in such position as shall be approved by the Landlord (such\napproval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) such works to\nbe completed before the Deed of Variation is completed”.\nThe Tribunal was not supplied with a copy of this licence.\n58. R1 seeks an easement over the planned external staircase for Flat 59.\nThis was not included in their draft leases or addressed in the Schedule.\nRather, it was first requested in Mr Oberoi’s statement dated 13\nNovember 2020. The location/design of the staircase is not known, as\n14\n\nR1 is yet to seek planning consent. Based on Mr Oberoi’s evidence, it\nwill be different to the temporary staircase shown in A’s photographs.\nHe says it will not be demised and seeks a widely drafted right of access\nand egress.\n59. The letter from ABCL and design review statement from Mr Awolesi,\nboth recommend a fire escape. The latter recited part of section 3.21 of\nApproved Document B1, which provides practical guidance on the\nBuilding Regulations 2010, namely:\n“When multi-storey flats do not have their own external entrance at\nground level, adopt one of the following approaches.\nApproach 2 – provide at least one alternative exit from each storey\nthat is not the entrance storey of the flat. All habitable rooms should\nhave direct access to a protected landing (Diagram 3.6 and\nparagraph 3.22).”\nMr Awolesi did not recite the other approaches recommended at\nsection 3.21.\n60. Mr Rainey submitted that the Tribunal cannot decide if a fire escape is\nnecessary to comply with current Building Regulations. Rather, it must\ndetermine the terms of the leaseback so as to permit compliance with\nthose Regulations.\n61. The Tribunal refuses R1’s request for an easement over the planned\nexternal staircase. This was made too late in the day (only 11 days\nbefore the hearing), is too uncertain and too widely drafted. The\nTribunal agrees it cannot decide if a fire escape is necessary. This is a\nmatter for THC. However, the 2017 Planning Permission did not\nrequire a fire escape. R1 started work and, on Mr Oberoi’s evidence,\nhas substantially completed the development without seeking consent\nfor an escape. This suggests it is unnecessary, as does the absence of\nany specification or drawings. It is over two years since the October\n2018 Agreement. If a fire escape is necessary then this should have\nbeen addressed before now. The draft easement is too wide, as it is not\nrestricted to egress or emergency use and would allow the leaseholder\nto use the proposed fire escape for unrestricted access to and egress\nfrom the flat. In any event, if an escape is found to be necessary and is\nconstructed then the leaseholder can always rely on the general right of\nway at paragraph 4 of part II of the first schedule in both draft\nleasebacks. This general right is sufficient to meet the requirements of\nparagraph 11(a) of schedule 9 to the 1993 Act.\nThe terms of the commercial leasebacks\n62. R1 is to be granted reversionary leasebacks of the seven commercial\nunits on the ground floor (1, 3, 5, 6, 117, 120 and 123). Each of these\nunits is already subject to a commercial lease. Up until the evening of\n23 November 2020 the only issue was whether the leasebacks of Units\n15\n\n3 and 123 should include express rights to place tables and chairs\noutside these units.\n63. The terms of the commercial leasebacks were agreed by the solicitors\nacting for A and R1 in an email exchange dated 18 April 2019. These\nterms did not include rights for outside tables and chairs. R1\nacknowledged this agreement in the Schedule but said this was a\nmistake for Units 3 and 123. The leaseholders of these units had been\nallowed to place tables and chairs outside their premises and this\nuse/right had existed for over 15 years. R1 contends that the absence of\nexpress rights was an obvious omission that must have been apparent\nto A and it can resile from the agreement. The addition of express\nrights would not prejudice A and the use of outside space is particularly\nimportant during the current pandemic, given the need for social\ndistancing . A contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to\ndetermine these leasebacks under s.24(1) of the 1993 Act, as all terms\nhave been agreed.\n64. At 6.30pm on 23 November 2020 the case officer received an email\nfrom R1’s solicitor, attaching a letter and copies of six undated deeds of\nvariation. The letter reads:\n“The First Respondent has created Deed of Variations in respect of the\nfollowing long lease commercial units namely, Units 1, 3, 5, 6, 117, 120\nand 123 Meridian Place and the following Reversionary long lease\ncommercial unit leases namely Units 1, 3, 5, 6 and 120 Meridian Place\nwhich have all been executed in Escrow by the First Respondent and\nthe registered leaseholders of the said Units and these are attached.\nThese Deeds of Variation are foreshadowed in our Counsel, Philip\nRainey QC’s Skeleton Argument who will give an explanation of them\nat the Hearing.\nThe Applicant is copied in.”\n65. The reference to “commercial unit leases” is confusing, as all six\ndocuments are headed “DEED OF VARIATION”. There is one deed\nbetween R1 and KGL for Units 1, 3, 5, 6 120 and 123, a second between\nR1 and KGL for Units 1, 3, 5, 6 and 120 and a third between R1 and\nTazeen Hayat, Mr Sattar and Brian White for Unit 117. There are also\ncounterparts of each deed. The originals have been executed by R1 and\nthe counterparts executed by the tenants. As at the date of the hearing,\nnone had been completed or dated. Rather, they were held in escrow\nby R1’s solicitors. R2 and R3 are not parties to the deeds.\n66. The deeds, if completed and registered, will vary the corresponding\ncommercial leases. The proposed variations are contained in the\nschedules. In each case they will add a definition of “The Outside\nSeating Area” with reference to a plan and a Tenant’s covenant to keep\n(or procure to be kept) this area clean and tidy. They will also add the\nfollowing Tenant’s easement:\n16\n\n“During such time that the Premises is open for business provided that\ni) the Tenant does not substantially interfere with the rights of\npassage of the other leaseholders of the building in which the\nPremises are situated and\nii) the Tenant does not interfere with the obligations of the\nLandlord as to the maintenance and repair contained in any\nlease of the building in which the Premises are situated\nThe Tenant has the right to place and keep tables and chairs,\numbrellas and external space heaters on the Outside Seating Area and\nuse such area in conjunction with the Premises and the right to permit\nthe occupier for the time being of the Premises so to do”\n67. The deeds were foreshadowed in Mr Rainey’s skeleton argument. He\nsubmitted that R1 could grant express easements and rely on these as a\nchange of circumstances, since the time terms were agreed. This could\nlead to a modification of those terms by the Tribunal, pursuant to\ns.24(4)(b)(i).\n68. At the time of the Tribunal’s inspection, in October 2018, the kiosk at\nthe front of Unit 123 was operating as a café and external tables and\nchairs were in use. These can be seen in one of the photographs in R1’s\nbundle, as can tables and chairs outside Unit 1.\n69. In her oral submissions, Ms Muir reiterated that terms had been agreed\non 18 April 2019 and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. If the\nleaseholders of Units 3 and 123 have implied rights for tables and\nchairs, based on long usage, then there is no need for express rights.\nThe current leases do not include such rights and they are unnecessary,\nas Unit 123 is now vacant and Unit 3 is used as a language school. Only\nUnits 1 and 6 are currently used as cafes and these were not addressed\nin the Schedule. Further, the deeds have not been completed or\nregistered so the rights in those deeds are not legal easements.\n70. Ms Muir submitted there has been no change of circumstances for the\npurposes of s.24(4)(b)(i), as the express rights are yet to be granted and\n(on R1’s case) the tenants already have implied rights. Further, the use\nof the word “may” in this subsection means the Tribunal has a\ndiscretion whether to determine alternative terms. In any event, the\ngrant of express rights would be a breach of s.19(1) and the deeds will\nbe void, as an easement is an interest within s.101.\n71. A has no particular objection to Units 1 or 6 putting out tables and\nchairs, if they already have implied rights. However, it does not want\nfurniture all the way along the front concourse as this would obstruct\nother leaseholders’ rights of way and furniture outside Unit 123 could\nblock any fire escape for Flat 59.\n17\n\n72. Mr Rainey explained that there are three deeds, as the existing\ncommercial leases are of differing lengths. He accepted that terms had\nbeen agreed in April 2019 but this agreement is deemed subject to\ncontract. It does not prevent the Tribunal from investigating those\nterms, as established in Broomfield Freehold Management Ltd v\nMeadow Holdings Ltd [13/11/2007], an unreported decision of\nthe Lands Tribunal. In that case HHJ Reid QC upheld the LVT’s\ndecision that it had jurisdiction to determine the freehold price where\nsurveyors had ‘agreed’ a price, without considering the effect of s.62 of\nthe Law of Property Act 1925. Their failure to consider s.62 rights,\nwhen quantifying the diminution in value of retained land, meant there\nwas no agreement as to the price.\n73. Mr Rainey submitted that the Tribunal could look behind the April\n2019 agreement, as the existence of outside tables and chairs was\ncommon knowledge and had been overlooked when agreeing the\nleasebacks. This was an obvious mistake by A and R1.\n74. Mr Rainey submitted that table and chair rights will be a change of\ncircumstances for the purposes of s.24(4)(b)(i). The deeds can be\ncompleted and registered prior to completion of the freehold purchase.\nThe date for determining which easements to include is the\n“appropriate time” under paragraph 1(1) of schedule 9, being\ncompletion, rather than the “relevant date” as defined in s.1(8).\nRegistration would make good any current deficiency, as to the status\nof the new easements. In that event, the leasebacks should include\neasements in the same form as the deeds. These include a proviso not\nto interfere with other leaseholders’ rights of passage, which addresses\nA’s concern.\n75. Mr Rainey accepted that the grant of an easement can, in certain\ncircumstances, be a disposal for the purposes of s.19(1)(a)(i) but not in\nthis case. R1 will not dispose of a freehold interest when granting the\ndeeds; rather it will vary leasehold interests.\n76. Mr Rainey submitted that a change of circumstances application can be\nmade to Tribunal without a prior application to the Court. There is no\nauthority on the point but s.24(4)(b)(i) does not restrict the timing of\nthe application. Further, the wording makes it clear that such an\napplication can be made where terms have been agreed.\n77. As to discretion, the word “may” means the Tribunal must first look at\nwhether it is necessary to revisit the terms agreed or determined. If\nthere has been a change of circumstances, as is the case here, then it\nmust determine the terms in the light of that change. The subsection\nallows a party to go back on an agreement and, in Mr Rainey’s words\n“change the rules of the game halfway through”.\n18\n\n78. In response, Ms Muir distinguished the facts in Broomfield. Neither\nsurveyor had considered s.62 rights in that case whereas here the\nleasebacks were agreed in their entirety. Further, the omission of table\nand chair rights was not an obvious mistake as no such rights appear in\nthe existing commercial leases. In the case of Unit 123, the existing\nlease was only granted in 2012 so the tenant (KMG) is unlikely to have\nacquired an implied easement for tables and chairs.\n79. Ms Muir submitted that the deeds of variation will breach s.19(1), as R1\nwill sever its interest in the “specified premises”, by granting rights over\nits freehold land. The deeds will take effect as variations to the existing\nleases; rather than surrenders and re-grants.\n80. As to s.24(4)(b)(i), Ms Muir pointed out that the Tribunal has a\ndiscretion when determining the terms of a leaseback (under Schedule\n9). It follows that the Tribunal has a discretion as to any variation,\nfollowing a change of circumstances. It is not obliged to reopen a\ndecision or agreement every time a party says there has been a change.\nThe Tribunal’s decision\n81. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the terms of the\ncommercial leasebacks.\n82. The Tribunal makes no determination under s.24(4)(b)(i) of the 1993\nAct.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s decision\n83. The terms of the leasebacks, including Units 3 and 123, were agreed by\nsolicitors on 18 April 2019. R1 is not entitled to resile from that\nagreement. The facts of Broomfield, where neither surveyor\nconsidered a legal issue outside their field of expertise, can be\ndistinguished. In this case, A and B1 were legally represented with\nexperienced enfranchisement solicitors on both sides. The terms of the\nleasebacks were negotiated and agreed by those solicitors. There is no\nevidence of a mutual mistake. R1 acknowledged a mistake in the\nSchedule but there was no suggestion that A was similarly mistaken.\nThe existing leases do not include table and chair rights so their\nomission from the leasebacks is unsurprising. This was not an obvious\nmistake, as advanced by Mr Rainey.\n84. Mr Oberoi’s statement made no mention of a mistake in agreeing the\nleasebacks. He said s.62 rights were already enjoyed, based on\ninstructions from Mr Sattar. He sought express rights due to an\nescalation of issues with external tables and chairs and their recent\ndamage and removal. All of this suggests that express rights were an\nafterthought; only raised when Mr Oberoi learned of these issues.\n19\n\n85. The Tribunal is only able to “determine the matters in dispute”, under\ns.24(1). The terms of the leasebacks are not matters in dispute, having\nbeen agreed in April 2019. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction under this\nsubsection.\n86. The Tribunal then considered if it could determine modified terms\npursuant to s.24(4)(b)(i). R1 contends there has been a change of\ncircumstances due to the easements in the deed of variation. However,\nthose deeds had not been completed, let alone registered, at the date of\nthe hearing. The leaseback terms were agreed back in April 2019. R1\nand its tenants had 19 months to vary the leases, to include express\nrights for tables and chair, if they considered this necessary. At the\nvery latest, R1 was aware of the issue by the time the Schedule was filed\non 07 October 2020. However, the deeds were only disclosed the\nevening before the hearing, which was far too late.\n87. The existence of signed deeds, held in escrow, is not a change in\ncircumstances. They had not been completed or registered, meaning\nthe new express easements are not effective. If the deeds are completed\nthen they will need to be registered. A will be given notice of any\napplication to register, by virtue of the unilateral notice registered\nagainst the freehold title (protecting the.13 notice). At that point it can\nchallenge the deeds, if it considers it appropriate, under s.19. It will\nthen be for the County Court or F-tT (Property Chamber) (Land\nRegistration) to determine if the easements are void, within separate\nproceedings. This Tribunal cannot do so, as the deeds had not been\ncompleted at the date of the hearing.\n88. There is nothing in s.24(b)(i) to suggest an application to the Tribunal,\nto determine modified terms, can only be made after an application to\nthe Court. However, such an application is contingent on there being a\nchange in circumstances. The existence of the incomplete deeds it not a\nchange in circumstances and the Tribunal cannot consider an\napplication under this subsection. Rather there would need to be as\nseparate application to the Tribunal, as and when the deeds are\ncompleted and registered.\nName: Tribunal Judge Donegan Date: 12 April 2021\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) then a written application for permission must be made to\nthe First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing\nwith the case.\n20\n\n2. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the Regional\noffice within 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the\ndecision to the person making the application.\n3. If the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\nfor permission to appeal to proceed despite not being within the time\nlimit.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the\ncase number), state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\n21\n\nAppendix of relevant legislation\nLeasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (as\namended)\nCHAPTER 1 COLLECTIVE ENFRANCHISEMENT IN CASE OF TENANTS OF\nFLATS\nPreliminary\nSection 1 The right to collective enfranchisement\n(1) This chapter has effect for the purpose of conferring on qualifying\ntenants of flats contained in premises to which this Chapter applies on\nthe relevant date the right, exercisable subject to and in accordance\nwith this Chapter, to have the freehold of those premises acquired on\ntheir behalf -\n(a) by a person or persons appointed by them for the purpose, and\n(b) at a price determined in accordance with this Chapter;\nand that right is referred to in this Chapter as “the right to collective\nenfranchisement”.\n(2) Where the right to collective enfranchisement is exercised in relation to\nany such premises (“the relevant premises”) -\na) the qualifying tenants by whom the rights is exercised shall be\nentitled, subject to and in accordance with this Chapter, to have\nacquired, in like manner, the freehold of any property which is\nnot comprised in the relevant premises but to which this\nparagraph applies by virtue of subsection (3);

The Applicant seeks a determination pursuant to s.27A of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) as to the amount of service charges\npayable by the Applicant in respect of the major works costs demanded\non 2 October 2024.\nThe hearing\n2. The Applicant was represented by Mr Narayan at the hearing and the\nRespondent was represented by Ms Omar. Mr Roopnarine attended as\na witness for Mr Patel and Miss Mouna Ennafii as witness for the Council\n3. Immediately prior to the hearing the parties handed in further\ndocuments, namely skeleton arguments. The start of the hearing was\ndelayed while the tribunal considered these new documents. In addition,\nwe were provided the evening before the hearing with a bundle of papers\non behalf of the Respondent running to some 420 pages, which together\nwith the Applicants bundle resulted in some 660 pages of papers for us\nto potentially consider.\n4. This did not cause particular difficulties, for as can be seen below the\nissues were severely curtailed.\nThe background\n5. The property which is the subject of this application is a three bedroomed\nflat on the fourth floor of a block of 25 flats, being part of a development\nknown as Patmore Estate.\n6. Neither party requested an inspection, and the tribunal did not consider\nthat one was necessary, nor would it have been proportionate to the\nissues in dispute.\n7. The Applicant holds a long lease of the property dated 16 January 1989\nmade between the Respondent (1) and Keith and Louisa Anderson (2)\nwhich requires the landlord to provide services and the tenant to\ncontribute towards their costs by way of a variable service charge. The\nspecific provisions of the lease and will be referred to below, where\nappropriate.\n2\n\nThe issues\n8. Originally the issues related to service charges arising under major works\nin 2024 in respect of window repairs/replacement, decorating to the flat\nfront door, external decoration and roof repairs.\n9. At the start of the hearing the parties identified the relevant issues for\ndetermination as follows:\n(i) The sum payable by Mr Patel for double glazing works to his flat\nand a claim for £200 in respect of low water pressure.\n(ii) The outstanding sum was £2,084.50, which was agreed as an\namount although Mr Patel challenged the make-up of same.\n(iii) There is no issue that under the terms of his lease Mr Patel has to\npay 4.66% of the block costs and nor does Mr Patel challenge the\ns20 procedure or the actual costs of the works done.\n10. Having heard evidence and submissions from the parties and considered\nall of the documents provided, the tribunal has made determinations on\nthe various issues as follows.\nDouble glazing and water pressure\n11. As a result of the delivery of final accounts and spreadsheets from the\nCouncil Mr Patel was able to see how the Council had dealt with his\nliability. It was accepted by the Council that works to Mr Patel’s windows\nremains outstanding in the present sum of £651.52, which could be\nsubject to change. This was because the contractor had not been able to\ncomplete the works. There had been problems gaining access. We heard\nfrom Mr Roopnarine, Mr Patel’s tenant, that his wife has limited mobility\nand that there had been problems allowing access. We were told\nhowever, that contractors had earlier gained access to undertake some\nworks and it was not clear why these additional issues had not been\ncompleted at the same time.\n12. The Council stated that the incomplete window costs had been omitted\nfrom Mr Patel’s liability, leaving £651.52 still to be charged. Mr Patel,\nthrough Mr Narayan submitted that it was unreasonable for Mr Patel to\nbe asked to pay for others flat windows whilst work to his had not been\ncompleted.\n13. It was pointed out by Ms Omar that any additional cost Mr Patel faced\nwould have the benefit of contribution from the other tenants and that\nhe would only pay 4.66% as provided for in his lease.\n3\n\n14. As to the water pressure this was something of a non-event. It seems\nfrom what Mr Roopnarine said, that following the installation of new\nwater tanks it takes quite a long time for the water to reach the flat but\nthat when it does it is satisfactory. Mr Narayan indicated that this was no\nlonger an issue. In fact, it had not appeared in Mr Patel’s application.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n15. The tribunal determines that the balance of the amount payable in\nrespect of the final account is £2,084.50.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n16. We have some sympathy with Mr Patel in trying to fully understand the\naccounts. The invoice dated 2 October 2024 seeks £13,332 based on the\nestimated costs. We were told by Ms Ennafii in her statement that the\nsum of £13,332 included £1,844.50 attributable to Mr Pastel’s window\nrepairs. However, on a final review of all additions and omissions this\namount was reduced to £651.52. On 12 August 2025 the Council wrote\nto Mr Patel as follows:\n“FINAL ACCOUNT- C7137_ PATMORE EAST ESTATE PH 2 - WINDOW\nOVERHAULS, EXTERNAL DECORATIONS, AND ASSOCIATED\nREPAIRS\nThe Council undertook the above project during the 2023/24 financial\nyear and following completion of all the work the Final Account has\nnow been audited and all the payments made to the contractor. The\nfinal cost of this work was lower than the estimated sum, which was\nbilled in October 2024, this means that your proportion of the cost has\nreduced.\nThe actual charge for your flat is therefore as follows:\nEstimated charge - £13,332.00 (billed 2024)\nActual/final charge - £11,625.21\nDifference = £1,706.79 (credit)\nThe credit is worked out as follows:\nUnder the terms of your lease, you are responsible for 4.660%\nof the Final account Block Charge of £249,468.02. You are\ntherefore liable to contribute £11,625.21.\n4\n\nAs you have already been invoiced £13,332.00, a credit of\n£1,706.79 will be applied to your service charge account.\nA copy of the Contract Instructions for your block, issued\nthrough the course of the contract and that make up the final\naccount are available, and I can provide you with an\nelectronic or hard copy on request…..”\n17. At no point does it seem that the Council explained that part of the\nreduction was the fact that Mr Patel had not been charged for the balance\nof the works to his windows. However such an allowance has been made\nto the final amount sought from Mr Patel.\n18. Mr Patel has paid £9540.71 of the £11,625.21 outstanding leaving the\nsum of £2,084.50 due and owing.\n19. However, we are satisfied that the accounts do accurately reflect the\nactual costs incurred in respect of the major works and that it is correct\nthat Mr Patel should contribute to all the windows in the block for which\nthe Council has responsibility under the Fourth Schedule of the lease. In\ndue course, when his windows are dealt with, he can expect the Council\nto reflect his liability under the lease, which is 4.66% of the final block\ncharge of presently £651.52, which has yet to be levied.\n20. No application was made under s20C of the Act, as Mr Narayan\nconsidered that the lease made no provision for the contractual recovery\nof costs in this case.\nName: Andrew Dutton Date: 10 November 2025\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\n5\n\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n6"

Even if such a provision\nwere to exist within the Lease, the tribunal would have made an order\nunder the same section 20C so that none of the landlord’s costs of the\ntribunal proceedings could have been passed to the lessee through any\nservice charge.\n(3) The tribunal determines that the Respondent shall pay the Applicant\n£330 within 28 days of this Decision, in respect of the reimbursement\nof the tribunal fees paid by the Applicant.\nThe application\n1. The Applicant seeks a determination pursuant to s.27A of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) as to the budgeted amounts of\nservice charges payable by the Applicant in respect of the service charge\nyears 2022/2023 and 2023/2024. The final reconciliations in relation\nto the service charges for those two years have not as yet happened. The\nextent of the dispute between the parties to be determined within this\napplication is therefore in relation to budgeted amounts only; it does\nnot prevent the Applicant from later challenging the incurred service\ncharges should he choose to do so.\nThe hearing\n2. The Applicant appeared in person at the hearing and the Respondent\nwas represented by Ms Abbie Johnson and Mr Anthony Allder who are\nboth employees of AM Surveying and Block Management (‘the\nManaging Agent’). They both confirmed they were instructed by the\nRespondent to manage the Property and to attend this hearing.\n3. Two days before the hearing the Tribunal noted that a complete copy of\nthe original Lease dated 1987 was missing from the Bundle and\nrequested that the parties provide a further complete copy. Neither\nparty could find a complete copy of the Lease in respect of Flat 4, but\nthe Applicant was able to obtain a copy of the second page of the Lease\nfrom his neighbour’s Lease. The Respondent was able to have a look at\nthis copy as was the Tribunal; nothing turned on the wording of it.\n2\n\n4. The Tribunal set out at the start of the hearing that the issues in dispute\nwere the budgeted amounts for years 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 (‘the\nrelevant years’), as per the Applicant’s Application and the Schedule\nwhich solely dealt with those budgeted amounts. The full accounts and\nthe reconciliations of the service charges for the relevant years had not\nbeen provided by the Applicant and his objections raised in the\nSchedule did not query individual items of expenditure. For those\nreasons, the Tribunal did not consider the incurred costs.\n5. The Tribunal further made it clear that issues relating to the Applicant’s\napplication to become a director of the Right to Manage Company\n(RTM) and the rejection of that application, as well as any issues\nrelating to the running of the RTM by its directors were not issues for\nthis tribunal to determine.\nThe background\n6. The property which is the subject of this application is a Victorian\ndetached house split into four flats, hereinafter referred to as the\nBuilding. The Applicant is the owner and occupier of the leasehold to\nFlat 4, Elmers End Road, which is a ground floor flat with a garden\nimmediately at the back of it (as shown on the plan attached to the\nLease at [140]).\n7. Some photographs of the Building were provided in the hearing bundle.\nNeither party requested an inspection and the tribunal did not consider\nthat one was necessary, nor would it have been proportionate to the\nissues in dispute.\n8. The Applicant holds a long lease of the property. The original Lease is\ndated 21st December 1987 and the period of the Lease was extended on\n28th September 2016. A full copy of the Lease Extension is contained\nwithin the Bundle. The relevant provisions of the original Lease are still\nbinding between the parties. The Lease requires the landlord to provide\nservices and the tenant to contribute towards their costs by way of a\nvariable interim charge and ultimately a service charge. The specific\nprovisions of the lease will be referred to below, where appropriate.\nThe issues\n9. At the start of the hearing the parties identified the relevant issues for\ndetermination as follows:\n(i) The reasonableness of the budgeted service charges for the\nyears 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 (the interim charges);\n3\n\n(ii) The interim charges (for the whole building) over the relevant\nyears relating to:\na. General Repairs External;\nb. Bin Rental;\nc. Communal cleaning;\nd. General & Grounds Maintenance;\ne. Building insurance;\nf. General Repairs Internal;\ng. Reserve Fund Internal Parts.\n10. Having heard evidence and submissions from the parties and\nconsidered all of the documents provided, the tribunal has made\ndeterminations on these various issues as follows. The budgeted figures\nraised by the Applicant in the Schedule are for the whole building. The\ninterim charges for the Applicant’s property are obviously less than\nthose figures, dependant on the percentage contribution as set by the\nLease but this was not in issue between the parties. The remainder of\nthe discussion by the Tribunal as to those figures will proceed on the\nbasis of the total figures given for the whole building.\nGeneral Repairs External\n11. The budgeted costs for the year 2022/2023 were £3,000 [31] and for\nthe year 2023/2024 they were £4,000. The Applicant raised an\nobjection to these costs on the basis that he could see no works having\nbeen done and it was not clear what the £7,000 was held for; the\nbuilding was very run down.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n12. The tribunal determines that the budgeted amounts in respect of the\ngeneral repairs - external in the sum of £3,000 was reasonably\nbudgeted for the year 2022/2023 and similarly in the sum of £4,000\nfor the year 2023/2024.\n4\n\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n13. It is not in dispute that the Lease imposes various repairing and\nmaintenance obligations on the Landlord (see clause 5(d) of the Lease\n[132]). It is further not in dispute that this obligation is conditional\nupon the payment of an interim charge and the service charge by the\nApplicant to the Respondent, as charged by them on behalf of the\nLandlord. The issue that the Tribunal is concerned with here is the\ninterim charge in terms only of the reasonableness of the amount\ncharged.\n14. It is not unreasonable though for the Respondent to budget for repairs\nto a building in order that it can comply with its repairing obligations\nunder the Lease. There is evidence of some works having been carried\nout. Whether or not they are reasonably incurred and reasonable in\namount is not for this Tribunal to determine based on the issues raised\nin the Application. The figure of £4,000 budgeted for the year\n2023/2024 appears reasonable as it was based on the previous year’s\nexpenditure of some £3,800. As it turns out, a much smaller figure was\nactually spent on repairs that year but this will be credited back to the\nApplicant in any event.\n15. The basis of the budgeted figure for the year 2022/2023 of £3,000 is\nless clear. The accounts for the year ending September 2022 appear to\nshow a figure of £870 spent on general repairs. The Respondent\ncompany was incorporated in November 2021. The Managing Agent\ntook over the management of the Building in May 2022 and the\nTribunal was informed that having reviewed the properties a budget\nwas set for the building in consultation with the Respondent. There are\nno specifications for the basis of the budget and no real explanation was\ngiven as to how this figure was arrived at. There were a number of items\nthat were identified as needing to be dealt with such as drains and\ngutters, and potentially a fence. All of those would have needed some\nbudget being set. Looking at the expenditure on the externals in the\nyear 2022/2023 being in excess of £3,000, the Tribunal appreciates the\nbudgeted figure appears reasonable with the benefit of hindsight but\neven without that hindsight, given the size of the building and the\nrepairing obligations, it was not unreasonable to set an amount as a\nbudgeted figure. It is not accepted that nothing was being done on the\nBuilding. What might have been done may not have necessarily been\nvisibly appreciated by the Applicant. All that the Tribunal has to\ndetermine is whether the budget was reasonably set at that amount.\nWhether the works actually done were of a reasonable standard was not\npart of the remit of the Application and the issues raised in the\nSchedule did not cover this. The figure budgeted for the year\n2022/2023 was reasonable.\n5\n\nBin Rental: budgeted figures of £120 (2022/2023) and £470\n(2023/2024)\n16. The Applicant conceded that this item was properly chargeable to him\nas a leaseholder within the terms of the Lease.\n17. The Respondent conceded that the Council has incorrectly charged\nthem for four bins instead of one and that resulted in an increase to the\nbudget the following year. A credit is going be issued to the Respondent\nby the Council which will be passed on to the leaseholders of the\nBuilding. Consequently, the budgeted figure should never have been\n£470 but instead it should have been £120 as per the previous year.\n18. A further argument raised by the Applicant was that he should not be\ncharged, along with the other leaseholders, for the rental of a bin from\nthe Council but instead a one off purchase of a bin is what should be\ndone so as to avoid the rental costs going forward.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n19. The tribunal determines that the budgeted amount of the interim\ncharge for this item for the year 2022/2023 is reasonable in the sum of\n£120. The budgeted amount of the interim charge for the year\n2023/2024 is not reasonable and should have been £120, as conceded\nby the Respondent.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n20. Given the concession as to there being no rationale for the increased\namount of this particular budgeted item for the year 2023/2024, the\nTribunal gives no further reasons on this point.\n21. The Tribunal does not accept that it would have been more cost\neffective for the purchase of a one off bin to have been made for two\nreasons: (i) there were no quotes provided to show what it would have\nactually cost to purchase a bin such that it was unable to compare the\ncost of one against the other; and (ii) the Respondent’s explanation of\nthe efficiency of renting a bin from the Council was accepted because it\nmeant that if there was any damage caused to it, the Council would\nsimply replace it and was ultimately responsible for the maintenance of\nit. This is certainly not an unreasonable basis on which to budget for\nthe provision of such an item.\nCommunal cleaning\n22. The budgeted amounts being challenged for the years 2022/2023 and\n2023/2024 are £800 for each year.\n6\n\nThe tribunal’s decision\n23. The Tribunal determines that the Respondent is entitled under the\nterms of the Lease to budget for the provision of cleaning services.\nHowever, it would have been reasonable to budget a figure of £400 per\nannum, and not £800.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n24. There was some discussion during the hearing as to whether the\nRespondent is able to charge this item at all by way of service charges in\nrespect of obligations imposed on the Landlord under clauses 5(d) to\n(g) of the Lease. These clauses did not appear to cover this item.\nHowever, during the course of the hearing dealing with other matters,\nthe Tribunal’s attention was drawn to the Fifth Schedule which did\nrefer to the ability to charge interim charges and service charges for all\nthose expenses incurred under clauses 5(d) to (g) and ‘any other costs\nreasonably incurred in maintaining the Building’. The Tribunal\ntherefore decided that this item was recoverable under the terms of the\nLease and could reasonably be budgeted for.\n25. The objection that is in fact raised by the Applicant is that this is not\ngood value. It concerns a very small area of the internal hallway and the\nstairwell; no cleaning is done and the amounts budgeted for are\nexcessive.\n26. Having been raised in the Schedule by the Applicant, the Respondent\nfailed to set out how it arrived at the budgeted figure of £800. There\nwas no specification of the works. All that was provided was a log to\nshow that an employee of the Managing Agent had been attending once\na month, but it was not clear for what purpose. It was said that these\nwere monthly visits, which were supported by the GPS log of the\nvehicles attending at the Building, but it was not clear at all what\nanyone was required to do during any attendance. There was a\nsuggestion that what needed to be done was the hoovering of the stairs\nonce a month. The amount of £800 spread over 12 months would result\nin each visit costing around £66.67. Some visits were as short as 11\nminutes in duration.\n27. In the absence of any explanation of specification of works and details\nof what has actually been done during these visits, the Tribunal accepts\nthat it would be reasonable to budget for a sum to cover the communal\ncleaning costs but this is more reasonably set at £400 per annum as a\nbudgeted figure.\n7\n\nGeneral and Grounds Maintenance\n28. The sum of £600 was budgeted for each of the two service years\n2022/2023 and 2023/2024. The objections raised by the Applicant\nwere that no works were done at all to justify this amount or any\namount.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n29. The Tribunal determines that it was not reasonable for any figure to be\nbudgeted under this heading on the basis that the Lease does not\nprovide for the recovery of those sums at all.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n30. The Landlord’s repairing and other obligations were set out in clauses\n5(d) to (g). These were conditional upon the payment of interim and\nservice charges by the leaseholders. The Fifth Schedule to the Lease\ndealt with the definitions of the ‘total expenditure’ in respect of which\ninterim and service charges could be recovered from the leaseholders\nand the apportionment between them of that total expenditure.\n31. The Building was not specifically defined within the Lease but the\nTribunal gave it its natural meaning, i.e. the physical construction\nwhich contained the four flats. The garden was mentioned separately to\nthe Building within the Lease and was defined by being delineated in\nred on a plan attached to the Lease. It was clear that the garden was\npart of the demise within the Lease and the Landlord had no\nmaintenance obligations towards it or the internal part of the flat. All\nthe gardens were to the rear of the Building.\n32. To the front of the Building there is a large yard which is covered in\ngravel. There is also an access alleyway leading from that yard along the\nside of the Building to the rear gardens. These are marked out in faint\nblue at [144]. The Lease stipulates that there is a right of access granted\nto the Applicant across the yard and the alleyway as well as parking on\nthe yard. It appears that all the other leaseholders are also granted the\nsame rights of access and use.\n33. The Lease does not however stipulate who is responsible for the\nmaintenance of the yard and the alleyway. It appears to be silent on it.\n34. The ability to recover service charges from the leaseholders is expressly\ndealt with in the Fifth Schedule and makes reference to clauses 5(d) to\n(g) and any other costs or expenses incurred in respect of the Building.\nAll the obligations referred to within clauses 5(d) to (g) referred to the\n8\n\nBuilding also. The yard and the alleyway do not fall within the\ndefinition of the ‘Building’.\n35. There is no basis on which the Landlord can seek any interim or service\ncharge in respect of this item under the Lease. No amount should have\nbeen budgeted for this.\nBuildings Insurance\n36. The sums budgeted for the year 2022/2023 were £2,050; for the year\n2023/2024 this sum was £3,000. The objection raised by the Applicant\nis that there is an inexplicable increase of £950 from one year to the\nnext and he has obtained cheaper quotes.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n37. The Tribunal determines that the budgeted figure of £2,050 was\nentirely reasonable for the year 2022/2023. The budgeted figure for the\nyear 2023/2024 was reasonably set in the sum of £3,000.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n38. The Applicant did not in fact seek to raise a challenge to the budgeted\nfigure of £2,050 for the year 2022/2023. It was only in relation to the\nyear 2023/2024 that he was arguing the budgeted sum was\nunreasonable, largely based on his own quotes obtained and provided\nfor in the hearing bundle at [88].\n39. During the course of the hearing, Mr Allder on behalf of the\nRespondent explained that the issues relating to the leak to the\nApplicant’s property were indeed subject to an insurance claim. There\nhad also been other insurance claims which would have been declared\nto the insurance broker. As a result, these are likely to have affected the\ninsurance premium.\n40. The Applicant’s quote will not have taken this into account and in any\nevent the quotes he obtained were in respect of three flats only and not\nfour. The Respondent’s quotes would have been in relation to four flats.\n41. It was further explained by the Respondent that there had been\nincreases in insurance premiums across the board, the index linking\nhad been high and a higher sum of £3,000 was set for the year\n2023/2024.\n42. Based on all of the above, the Tribunal concluded that the budgeted\nsum was entirely reasonable.\n9\n\n43. As it happened, the actual insurance premium for the year 2023/2024\nwas lower than the budgeted figure and this will be reconciled on the\nservice charge account eventually.\nGeneral Repairs Internal\n44. The amounts budgeted for the respective service years 2022/2023 and\n2023/2024 were £350 and £500. The objection raised by the Applicant\nis that there are no internal repairs carried out and this figure is also in\naddition to the Reserve Fund in relation to the internal repairs.\nThe tribunal’s decision\n45. The budgeted amounts for the respective service charge years are\nreasonable in amount as interim charges.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n46. The Landlord clearly has an obligation to carry out general repairs to\nthe internal parts of the Building as per the Lease. The Applicant\nconceded this. It is further entitled under the terms of the Lease to\ncharge an interim charge in respect of its obligations. The amounts set\nfor the respective years’ budgets are not unreasonable as interim\ncharges. Whether they were reasonably incurred and/or reasonable in\namount are not disputes which are before this Tribunal at this stage. It\nis open to the Applicant to challenge these once the service charge\naccounts are reconciled.\n47. Whilst the Applicant claimed that nothing had in fact been done, the\nTribunal did not accept this was the case as there had clearly been some\nrepairs done as evidenced by the Ledger account history. It was to be\nexpected that some repairs might arise in relation to this item, in terms\nof the stairwell, the carpet, the cupboard in the communal area, etc.\nThe sums budgeted are not excessive at all and if they are not spent\nthey will be credited back to the service charge account.\nReserve Fund Internal Parts\n48. The budgeted figure for each of the service charge years was £500. The\nApplicant’s objection is based on the fact that the only internal parts\nthat require any attention by the Landlord are the hallway and\nstairwell, the combined area of which is very small. This is in addition\nto the separately budgeted costs for the internal repairs as set out in the\nabove item.\n10\n\nThe tribunal’s decision\n49. The Tribunal determines that there is no provision within the Lease\nthat would allow the Landlord to recover an interim or a service charge\nin respect of this. No amount should therefore have been budgeted for\nthis item.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n50. There is no provision within the Lease which would allow for the\ncollection of a Reserve Fund. The Respondent was invited to point out\nany part of the Lease that would allow for this but was unable to. The\ndefinitions of ‘total expenditure’ within the Fifth Schedule to the Lease,\nparagraph 1(1) refer to expenditure incurred in carrying out the\nobligations under clauses 5(d) (e) (f) and (g) of the Lease and ‘any other\ncosts and expenses reasonably and properly incurred in connection\nwith the Building’. The relevant clauses of the Lease referred to do not\nmake provision for the collection of a Reserve Fund at all and certainly\nnot in relation to the internal parts. The second definition relates to\ncosts and expenses ‘incurred’ rather than anticipated to be incurred,\nwhich is what a Reserve Fund contemplates. In the absence of a specific\nprovision within the Lease for a Reserve Fund, it is not reasonable to\nbudget for such an amount.\nApplication under s.20C and refund of fees\n51. At the end of the hearing, the Applicant made an application for a\nrefund of the fees that he had paid in respect of the application/\nhearing1. Having heard the submissions from the parties and taking\ninto account the determinations above, the tribunal orders the\nRespondent to refund any fees paid by the Applicant within 28 days of\nthe date of this decision.\n52. In the application form, the Applicant applied for an order under\nsection 20C of the 1985 Act. There was however no provision within the\nLease to pass on any of the Respondent’s costs of the tribunal\nproceedings to the Applicant. The Respondent was invited to point out\nany part of the Lease that would allow it to do so, but was unable to. In\nthe circumstances, the tribunal need not consider further the\napplication under section 20 C of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.\n53. Even if such a provision were to exist within the Lease, the tribunal\nwould have made an order under the same section 20C so that none of\nthe landlord’s costs of the tribunal proceedings could have been passed\n1 The Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013\n11\n\nto the lessee through any service charge, on the basis that it is just and\nequitable in the circumstances for such an order to be made.\n54. The Applicant had succeeded in challenging a significant number of the\nbudgeted amounts. He had not succeeded in them all but despite the\nopportunity being given to the Respondent to explain in the Schedule\nhow the budgeted amounts had been arrived at, it failed to do so in\nrelation to all of the items. It was also only at the hearing that certain\nconcessions were made by the Respondent.\nName: Judge Vodanovic Date: 22.6.2025\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n12"

The tribunal has considered the proposed Appellant’s request for\npermission to appeal dated 15th January 2019 and determines that:\n(a) it will not review its decision; and\n(b) permission be refused.\n2. In accordance with section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement\nAct 2007 and rule 21 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) (Lands\nChamber) Rules 2010, the proposed Appellant may make further\n1\n\napplication for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber). Such application must be made in writing and be received by\nthe Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) no later than 14 days after the date\non which the First-tier Tribunal sent notice of this refusal to the party\napplying for permission to appeal.\nReasons\nIntroduction\n3. The Housing and Planning Act 2016 (“the 2016 Act”) introduced an\nability on the part of local housing authorities to issue Financial Penalty\nNotices against people who are guilty of various offences, one of which is\nthe failure to comply with conditions on a Housing in Multiple Occupation\n(“HMO”) licence. This is an alternative to prosecution.\n4. The proposed Appellant was served with a financial penalty notice\nordering him to pay £19,374. This Tribunal reduced that amount to\n£2,000 and the proposed Appellant wants permission to appeal against\nsuch Tribunal decision.\n5. This decision was dated 23rd November 2018 and was sent to the parties\nimmediately with full information as to how and when to seek permission\nto appeal. On the 17th December 2018, the proposed Appellant sent an e-\nmail to the Tribunal office saying that he was “delighted” with the\ndecision. He said that he had had a meeting with an officer of the\nproposed Respondent after the hearing, and that following such meeting\nhe was left with “a big question mark” in his head. He said that he had\nasked for a meeting with an officer – whether it was the same one is not\nknown.\n6. The meeting, he said, was going to be “probably after Xmas in January\n19”. He adds “I am afraid I am unable to find much more definitive\ninformation than I currently have for my APPEAL”.\n7. A response was sent to the proposed Appellant on the same day (17th\nDecember 2018) pointing out that any request for permission to appeal\nout of time must set out why the application was late. The contents of rule\n52(4) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier)(Property Chamber)\nRules 2013 were set out in the letter.\n8. This application is dated 15th January 2019 and includes what the Tribunal\nwill take to be an application for an extension of time but the explanation\nfor its lateness simply refers to the reply of the 17th December not being\nlocated until the 21st December as it had been delivered to a neighbour in\nerror. It also says that the proposed Appellant had hoped to have\nmeetings with the proposed Respondent’s officer or officers before what he\nrefers to as “re-appealing against the final decision”.\n2\n\n9. The reasons for the late application are not strong but the Tribunal accepts\nthat the Christmas holiday period was within the 28 days and the\napplication is only just over 2 weeks late. In the circumstances the\napplication is accepted out of time.\n10. The grounds of the proposed appeal are not easy to identify. They seem to\namount to correct procedures not being explained properly to the\nproposed Appellant in 2017 by the then officer(s) of the proposed\nRespondent. The problem with that, is that the hearing before the\nTribunal went into those matters in some detail and, as is recorded in the\ndecision, the proposed Appellant clearly accepted that (a) his property was\nan HMO and (b) that he had not complied with imposed requirements,\nparticularly with regard to fire precautions. He thought that the whole\nprocess was wrong, but he accepted the technical breaches. He\nconfirmed, at the hearing, that he had deliberately failed to comply with\nthe license conditions because he was so unhappy about the process.\n11. The fact that these breaches were of a relatively technical nature was the\nreason for the Tribunal dramatically reducing the financial penalty. There\nis nothing in the application for permission to appeal which adds to the\nfacts revealed at the hearing and the proposed Appellant does not say that\nhe now challenges either the technical breaches or any of the reasons for\nthe decision made by the Tribunal.\n12. In the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot see that any appeal has a\nreasonable chance of success and the application for permission is refused.\n………………………………………\nBruce Edgington\nRegional Judge\n17th January 2019\n3"

      "text": "FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL\nPROPERTY CHAMBER (RESIDENTIAL\nPROPERTY)\nCase Reference : LON/00BA/LDC/2025/0797\n37 – 43 Robinson Road, Colliers Wood,\nProperty :\nLondon SW17 9DL\nApplicant : Southern Land Securities Limited\nRepresentatives : Together Property Management\nRespondents : The 8 leaseholders at the Property\nApplication for the dispensation of\nconsultation requirements pursuant to\nType of Application :\nS. 20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985\nTribunal Members : Mr Duncan Jagger MRICS\nDate of\nDetermination and : 27 October 2025\nDecision\nDECISION\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nDecisions of the Tribunal\n(1) The Tribunal grants the application for the dispensation of all or any\nof the consultation requirements provided for by section 20 of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 (Section 20ZA of the same Act).\n(2) The reasons for the Tribunal’s decision are set out below.\nThe background to the application\n1. The property 37-43 Robinson Road, Colliers Wood, London\nSW17 9DL comprises 8 self-contained converted flats forming part of a\nthree storey detached Victorian building.\n2. The Tribunal did not inspect the property as it considered the\ndocumentation and information before it in the trial bundle enabled the\ntribunal to proceed with this determination.\n3. The documents that were referred to are in a bundle extending to 35\npages, the contents of which we have recorded, and which were\naccessible by all the parties. Therefore, the tribunal had before it an\nelectronic/digital trial bundle of documents prepared by the applicant in\naccordance with previous directions.\n(A) The Applicant seeks dispensation under section 20ZA of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) from all the consultation\nrequirements imposed on the landlord by section 20 of the 1985 Act, (see\nthe Service Charges (Consultation Requirements) (England) Regulations\n2003 (SI2003/1987), Schedule 4.) The request for dispensation\nconcerns urgent damp prevention works to the chimney lead flashings\nand removal of ventilation grill in accordance with the two invoices for\nsuch works in the total sum of £1,530 from Lexicon Circle Ltd. The work\nis said to be urgent due to water ingress to flat 41B.\n4. Section 20ZA relates to consultation requirements and provides as\nfollows:\n“(1)Where an application is made to a leasehold valuation\ntribunal for a determination to dispense with all or any of the\nconsultation requirements in relation to any qualifying works\nor qualifying long term agreement, the tribunal may make the\ndetermination if satisfied that it is reasonable to dispense with\nthe requirements.\n(2) In section 20 and this section—\n“qualifying works” means works on a building or any other\npremises, and “qualifying long term agreement” means (subject\nto subsection (3)) an agreement entered into, by or on behalf of\n2\n\nthe landlord or a superior landlord, for a term of more than\ntwelve months.\n….\n(4)In section 20 and this section “the consultation\nrequirements” means requirements prescribed by regulations\nmade by the Secretary of State.\n(5)Regulations under subsection (4) may in particular include\nprovision requiring the landlord—\n(a) to provide details of proposed works or agreements to\ntenants or the recognised tenants’ association representing\nthem,\n(b) to obtain estimates for proposed works or agreements,\n(c) to invite tenants or the recognised tenants’ association to\npropose the names of persons from whom the landlord should\ntry to obtain other estimates,\n(d) to have regard to observations made by tenants or the\nrecognised tenants’ association in relation to proposed works\nor agreements and estimates, and\n(e) to give reasons in prescribed circumstances for carrying out\nworks or entering into agreements.\n5. The Directions on 13 August 2025 made by Judge Dutton required any\ntenant who opposed the application to make their objections known on\nthe reply form produced with the Directions. No objections were received\nfrom the eight leaseholders in connection with the proposed damp\nprevention works.\n6. In essence, the works mentioned above are required to ensure that the\nbuilding is watertight in order to make the building safe for habitation\nand to comply with the Landlords covenants in the lease.\n7. The decision\n8. The Tribunal had before it a bundle of documents prepared by the\nApplicant that contained the application, grounds for making the\napplication including details of the necessary remedial work, two\ninvoices for the works from Lexicon Circle Ltd, a specimen copy lease a\ncopy Tribunal Directions and a statement from Judith Parkhouse of\nTogether Property Manangement.\nThe issues\n9. The only issue for the Tribunal to decide is whether or not it is reasonable\nto dispense with the statutory consultation requirements. This\napplication does not concern the issue of whether or not\nservice charges will be reasonable or payable.\n10. Having read the evidence and submissions from the Applicant and\nhaving considered all of the copy lease, documents and grounds for\n3\n\nmaking the application provided by the Applicant, the Tribunal\ndetermines the dispensation issues as follows.\n11. Section 20 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (as amended) and the\nService Charges (Consultation Requirements) (England) Regulations\n2003 require a landlord planning to undertake major works, where a\nleaseholder will be required to contribute over £250 towards those\nworks, to consult the leaseholders in a specified form.\n12. Should a landlord not comply with the correct consultation procedure, it\nis possible to obtain dispensation from compliance with these\nrequirements by such an application as is this one before the Tribunal.\nEssentially the Tribunal must be satisfied that it is reasonable to do so.\n13. In the case of Daejan Investments Limited v Benson [2013] UKSC 14, by\na majority decision (3-2), the Supreme Court considered the\ndispensation provisions and set out guidelines as to how they should be\napplied.\n14. The Supreme Court came to the following conclusions:\na. The correct legal test on an application to the Tribunal for\ndispensation is:\n“Would the flat owners suffer any relevant prejudice, and if so,\nwhat relevant prejudice, as a result of the landlord’s failure to\ncomply with the requirements?”\nb. The purpose of the consultation procedure is to ensure\nleaseholders are protected from paying for inappropriate works\nor paying more than would be appropriate.\nc. In considering applications for dispensation the Tribunal should\nfocus on whether the leaseholders were prejudiced in either\nrespect by the landlord’s failure to comply.\nd. The Tribunal has the power to grant dispensation on appropriate\nterms and can impose conditions.\ne. The factual burden of identifying some relevant prejudice is on\nthe leaseholders. Once they have shown a credible case for\nprejudice, the Tribunal should look to the landlord to rebut it.\nf. The onus is on the leaseholders to establish:\ni. what steps they would have taken had the breach not\nhappened and\n4\n\nii. in what way their rights under (b) above have been\nprejudiced as a consequence.\n15. Accordingly, the Tribunal had to consider whether there was any\nprejudice that may have arisen out of the conduct of the lessor/applicant\nand whether it was reasonable for the Tribunal to grant dispensation\nfollowing the guidance set out above.\n16. The Tribunal is of the view that, in the absence of any significant written\nrepresentations from any of the 2 leaseholders, it could not find\nprejudice to any of the tenants of the properties by the granting of\ndispensation relating to the roofing works set out in detail in the\ndocumentation in the trial bundle submitted in support of the\napplication.\n17. The Tribunal was mindful of the fact that the works were to be\nundertaken by the applicant supported by an inspection and report from\na Building Surveyor and that therefore dispensation is wholly\nappropriate.\n18. The Applicant believes the damp prevention works to the fabric of the\nVictorian building were vital given the nature of the problems reported\nand in effect the leaseholders of the properties have not suffered any\nprejudice by the failure to consult. On the evidence before it the Tribunal\nagrees with this conclusion and believes that it is reasonable to allow\ndispensation in relation to the subject matter of the application. It must\nbe the case that the necessary works should be carried out as a matter of\nurgency to ensure the upkeep of the fabric of the building and hence the\ndecision of the Tribunal.\n19. Rights of appeal made available to parties to this dispute are set out in\nan Annex to this decision.\n20. The Applicant shall be responsible for formally serving a copy of the\nTribunal’s decision on the 8 leaseholders. Furthermore, the Applicant\nshall place a copy of the Tribunal’s decision on dispensation together\nwith an explanation of the leaseholders’ appeal rights on its website (if\nany) within 7 days of receipt and shall maintain it there for at least 3\nmonths, with a sufficiently prominent link to both on its home page.\nCopies must also be placed in a prominent place in the common parts of\nthe block. In this way, leaseholders who have not returned the reply form\nmay view the tribunal’s eventual decision on dispensation and their\nappeal rights.\nName: Duncan Jagger MRICS Date: 27 October 2025\n5\n\nANNEX - RIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. If a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing with the\ncase.\n2. The application for permission to appeal must arrive at the Regional\noffice within 28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the\ndecision to the person making the application.\n3. If the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such\napplication must include a request for an extension of time and the\nreason for not complying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will\nthen look at such reason(s) and decide whether to allow the application\nfor permission to appeal to proceed despite not being within the time\nlimit.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the\ncase number), state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\n6"

This is an application made by the Applicant leaseholder pursuant to section 48\nof the Leasehold Reform Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (the Act)\nfor the determination of the premium to be paid for the grant of a new lease of\n65 Grove Hall Court, Hall Road, London NW8 9NY (the Property).\n2. By a notice of claim dated 2nd December 2021 served pursuant to section 42 of\nthe Act, the Applicant exercised the right for the grant of a new lease in respect\nof the Property. At the time the Applicant held the existing lease granted on a\nterm of 99 years from the 24th June 1997 at a current annual ground rent of\n£160 due to increase to £320 in June in 2043 for the remainder of the term.\nThe Applicant proposed a premium of £135,000 for the new lease.\n3. On 14th February 2022 the Respondent served a counter notice admitting the\nvalidity of the claim but counter proposing a premium in the sum of £237,095\nfor the grant of the new lease.\n4. The Applicant made application to the Tribunal for the premium to be\ndetermined on 27th July 2022.\nISSUES\n5. The following matters were agreed:-\n(1) The valuation date is 3rd December 2021.\n(2) The existing lease is for a term of 99 years from 24th June 1977.\n(3) The unexpired term on the lease as at the valuation date is 54.55 years.\n(4) The current annual ground rent is £160 due to increase to £320 on 24th\nJune 2043 for the remainder of the term.\n(5) The capitalisation rate is 6%.\n(6) The deferment rate is 5%.\n(7) The relativity was agreed at 74.27%.\n(8) The Property is described as a first floor, self-contained flat in an\neight/nine storey purpose-built block of flats thought to have been\nconstructed in the 1930s and containing 40 flats. The Property consists\nof a reception room with open plan kitchen, three bedrooms, two\nbathrooms and a separate WC.\n(9) The extended lease value, which is 99% of the freehold vacant possession\nvalue.\n(10) The imperial gross internal floor area of the Property is 1,053 square feet.\nMATTERS NOT AGREED\n6. The following matter were not agreed:-\n2\n\n(1) The parties disputed the internal layout of the Property. The Applicant valuer\ncontended that the Property should be valued in accordance with the lease plan\nand the current layout reflects improvements, which should be discounted. The\nRespondent’s valuer contends the Property should be valued in accordance with\nthe current layout and no discount for improvement should be considered.\n(2) The freehold vacant possession value (FVPV).\n(3) The current lease value.\n(4) The appropriate premium payable for a statutory lease extension.\nTHE HEARING\n7. The consideration of this case took place on 28th February 2023 by way of video\nhearing to which the parties consented. The Applicant was represented by Mr\nLester, who also provided the valuation report. The Respondent was\nrepresented by Miss Muir of Counsel with Mr Sharp as the Respondent’s expert.\n8. Neither party asked us to inspect the Property and we did not consider it\nnecessary to do so. The experts’ reports contained photographs both of the\nexterior, of the development and the interior of the subject Property.\n9. In a bundle of documents provided prior to the hearing we were given a copy of\nthe application and directions, notices served under section 42 and 45 of the\nLeasehold Reform Housing and Urban Development Act (the Act), copy entries\nof the freehold and leasehold title together with the existing lease and the\nApplicant and Respondent’s expert valuation reports.\n10. We heard firstly from Mr Lester on behalf of the Applicant. His report was\ndated 8th February 2023 and after giving details of the Property, his instructions\nhis CV and the documents he had seen, he gave a background to the Property\nitself. He told us he had inspected it in July in 2021 and it was as described in\nthe statement of agreed facts. It was suggested that the Property was well\nlocated in the heart of St Johns Wood with good access to facilities. The current\naccommodation was described as a reception room with open plan kitchen,\nthree bedrooms, two bathrooms and a separate WC. This was a change from the\noriginal layout shown on the lease plan which appeared to indicate that there\nhad been a reception room, separate kitchen, three bedrooms, bathroom and\nseparate WC. Mr Lester’s report confirmed that the gross internal floor area\nwas 1,053 square feet.\n11. The lease was said to be for a term of 99 years from 24th June 1977 and\naccordingly there was some 54.55 years of the term remaining at the valuation\ndate, which had been agreed as 3rd December 2021.\n12. Mr Lester first addressed the freehold vacant possession value (FHVP) and\nconfirmed that he had undertaken research of flats thought to be comparable to\nassist him in this exercise. There were appendices attached to which he had\nmade adjustments to the comparables that he put forward at 71, 52 and 45\nGrove Hall Court. In addition, to provide some form of consistent approach, he\nhad relied on two previous decisions of the First Tier Tribunal involving flats at\nGrove Hall Court heard in April of 2017. These related to flats numbered 25 and\n128 Grove Hall Court. The schedule that he relied upon had in turn been based\n3\n\nupon the schedules to the decisions of the above cases again to provide some\nconsistency in approach. He was of the view that 45 Grove Hall Court was the\nbest comparable and he gave additional weight to this when compared to 52 and\n71 Grove Hall Court. Having used these three comparables, which he adjusted\nboth in respect of the time, condition, the level of floor of the property and to\nadjust for a notional freehold, gave him a range of rates per square foot, which\nhe sought to apply to 65 Grove Hall Court.\n13. His report went on to give some more details of the comparable properties at 71\nand 52 Grove Hall Court as well as the property at 45 Grove Hall Court and the\nadjustments and weighting he applied. He had assessed a freehold price per\nsquare foot for the subject Property, based on the comparables and the\nweighting that he had given, of £996 which when applied to the internal floor\narea of the subject Property of 1,053 square feet, gave an FHVP of £1,048,788.\nThere was then a good deal of discussion in his report on the question of\nrelativity. We do not need to consider that because both valuers agreed that the\nappropriate relativity in this case was 74.27%, which we have accepted and we\nhave applied.\n14. Mr Lester doing these mathematics came up with a premium for the subject\nProperty of £167,460.\n15. In oral evidence to us and also the subject of cross-examination from Miss Muir,\nhe touched on the question of the improvements and was of the opinion that the\nworks that had been done to the Property by a predecessor in title did enhance\nthe valuation. He confirmed during his evidence that he was happy to agree the\nadjustment of .5% for floor level and the 1% for freehold.\n16. He was then asked why he had resiled from an agreed square footage in respect\nof No 45 Grove Hall in the previous decision that he had been involved in where\na 1,000 square feet had been agreed. It was put to him that he had described 45\nand 65 as being identical and therefore the same size and his request to\nattribute 1,000 square feet to 45 Grove Hall Court was inconsistent with the\n1,062 size that he understood had been the area attributed by estate agents on a\nprevious sale. Asked why he was not prepared to stick to the measurements that\nhe had agreed at the hearing in the previous case, he thought that they may have\nbeen in error and that the estate agents may have got the correct figure.\n17. There then followed deductions as to matters relating to condition and he was\nalso asked why he had a deduction in the region of £75,000 for condition in\nrelation to the subject Property when compared to 45 Grove Hall Court which\nhe put down to improvements. He was asked whether there should be a greater\nadjustment between ground and first floor level and from first floor level\nupwards. Mr Lester had used a .5% for each floor although it was put to him\nthat Mr Sharp had allowed a larger adjustment between ground floor and first\nfloor level. He also accepted that smaller flats had a greater £ per square foot\nrate, particularly relying on a comparable that Mr Sharp had put forward of 185\nGrove Hall Court.\n18. Asked again about whether the changes to the subject Property had enhanced\nthe value, he said he had no evidence to show the improvements had done so,\n4\n\nbut it was his opinion. After some further questioning, Mr Lester amended the\n£ per square foot for the subject Property and slightly amended the weighting\nthat he had given to Nos 71 and 52 as well as increasing the weighting to No 45\nto give an amended FHVP of £1,053,211 which applying that amendment gave a\npremium payable of £168,120.\n19. We then heard from Mr Sharp who has with Mr Taylor provided a detailed\nexpert’s report, which was dated 7th February 2023. This gave an introduction\nand summary of the case as well as the issues that we were required to\ndetermine. The location of the Property was given as was the description and he\nthen moved on to provide the long leasehold value and freehold assessments.\nAs with Mr Lester he had relied on 45 Grove Hall Court as the main comparable\nand included also by way of reference 52 Grove Hall Court, 71 Grove Hall Court\nand an additional one that was not used by Mr Lester, 185 Grove Hall Court. As\nwith Mr Lester he had applied various adjustments to cover for condition, time\nand floor level.\n20. In his report he cites No 45 as being the best comparable being sold only four\nmonths before the valuation date, a very similar flat, in the same section of the\ndevelopment albeit on the sixth floor as opposed to the first floor. In order to\ngive more weight to 45 as a comparable he used £ per square foot rate of £1,170\nwhich applied to the 1,053 square feet gives a figure of £1,232,010. Uplifted for\nfreehold gives a value of £1,244,454 which he has incorporated into his\ncalculation. He confirmed the relativity at 74.27%. The deferment rate and\ncapitalisation rates had been agreed and applying these he came to the\ndetermination that the premium for the subject Property should be £198,357.\n21. He confirmed that he made a slightly larger adjustment between ground and\nfirst floor than .5% and confirmed that one of the big differences between him\nand Mr Lester was the floor area applied to Flat 45. He said this should be\n1,000 square feet as had been agreed at the previous decision and not the larger\nsquare footage that Mr Lester sought to argue for.\n22. He was asked some questions by Mr Lester centring on the adjustments and a\nsuggested value for a second bathroom which he had put at £50,000.\nFINDINGS\n23. We were very grateful to the parties’ valuers for identifying three comparables\nwhich were agreed and so many elements of the valuation process. We were left\nonly to assess the freehold vacant possession value of the Property and apply\nthat to the agreed relativity.\n24. We examined the lead comparable at 45 and noted that there had been\ndisagreement between Mr Lester and Mr Sharp over the size to be used for\nanalysis. At the previous FTT decision Mr Lester had agreed an area of 1,000\nbut now sought to place greater alliance on the size cited by agents in the sales\nparticulars of 1,062 square feet. We find it somewhat strange that Mr Lester\nshould seek to resile from a size that he himself had agreed for the subject\nProperty at a different hearing, and in those circumstances we have applied, for\nthe purposes of this decision, an area to No 45 of 1,000 square feet.\n5\n\n25. No 45 is on the sixth floor but the same elevation of the block as the subject\nProperty. It was sold in August 2021 for £1,140,000, and both valuers agreed\non the approach to index this for time to the valuation date of 3rd December\n2021. Agreed indexation places the revised value of the comparable to\n£1,167,273 which when applied to the 1,000 square foot gives a rate of £1,167\nper square foot.\n26. The subject Property is on the first floor but No 45 is on the sixth. Both valuers\nagreed an approach of .5% increase in reflecting the increased amenity level as\nyou proceeded up the building. The adjustment between the first and sixth floor\nis therefore 2.5% and when applying this to the comparable it needs an\nadjustment, which gives a rate per square foot of £1,137.82.\n27. Other comparables were put forward by Mr Lester, namely Nos 71 and 52 which\nrequired more adjustment but were in our view useful in setting the context.\nThese two comparables supported the adoption of the rate gleaned from the\nanalysis of No 45 taking into account condition, size and floor area. The same\ncould not be said of the additional comparables suggested by Mr Sharp of 185 as\nit was two small and did not provide the comparability that No 45 did supported\nby 71 and 52.\n28. Applying the rate of £1,137.82 per square foot to the subject Premises which is\n1,053 square feet, gives a value of £1,198,124.\n29. The Act requires that the Property be valued disregarding any improvements\nmade by the original tenant or successors. Those improvements of course have\nto be of value. No 45 had a double living room, kitchen with window, good\ncondition kitchen fittings and a location of the kitchen across the hallway from\nthe living room. There was a separate bathroom and three bedrooms, the\nlargest having an en suite. In contrast the subject Property had a galley kitchen,\ntwo separate bathrooms but no en suites within the three bedrooms, although it\ndid not seem to us it would be difficult to create some form of bathroom/en\nsuite facility.\n30. It had been suggested by Miss Muir that the alteration to the flats may have\ntaken place before the grant of the lease based it seemed on the assessment that\nthe lease plan was different to that which was on the ground. It seems to us it is\nhighly unlikely that alterations would have taken place between the preparation\nof the plan for the lease and the works that were carried out to amend the\ninternal areas and, in those circumstances, we prefer to accept on the balance\nthat the alterations occurred subsequent to the original granting of the lease and\nas such any new value attributable to them would require to be removed.\n31. The original layout had a kitchen, which was remote from the living room, and\nhad a single bathroom. We felt on balance that the alterations made to the\nsubject Property did amount to an improvement and that adjustments were\nrequired. The first of the lead comparables No 45’s layout was with a double\nliving room and kitchen accessed across the corridor, separate bathroom and an\nen suite. This differed to the subject Property. In our view the subject\nProperty’s layout at the date of valuation is slightly poorer so we have allowed\n6\n\nan adjustment of £12,500 to the value, reducing the £1,198,124 to £1,185,624.\nWe consider this to be, in our opinion, reasonable. However, a further\nadjustment is required to take the value back to reflect the original condition of\nthe subject Property, as granted. The original layout comprised one bathroom\nand kitchen, with living areas at opposite ends of the flat This contrasted with\nthat of current layout with the improved galley kitchen and location. We\nconsider that a further adjustment for this is required and doing the best we can\nwe have come to the decision that this should be £12,000 which reduces the\nlong leasehold value to £1,173,624. We then applied the agreed freehold uplift\nof 1% and as both valuers have helpfully come to the same view on the question\nof relativity of 74.27%, this gives the existing lease value of £880,455.\n32. Accordingly, we determine that the price payable for the freehold of the subject\nProperty is as set out on the attached valuation, namely £189,072.\nAndrew Dutton\nJudge:\nA A Dutton\nDate: 22 March 2023\nANNEX – RIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1.

This is an application made by the Applicant (nominee purchaser/\nqualifying tenant) on 4 August 2021, following an application to the\ncounty court for a vesting order in relation to the freehold interest in\nthe premises known as 101B St Johns Road, Walthamstow, London E17\n4JH.\n2. The Applicant in her application to the county court, set out, and\nproduced documentary evidence confirming that she was the\nqualifying tenant of the above premises, pursuant to a 99-year lease\nheld by the claimant since 2015.\n3. In their county court application the applicants stated that they were\nunable to make a claim in accordance with the Act. In her witness\nstatement the Applicant confirmed that the landlords had been missing\nprior to her purchasing the property, and she detailed the steps that\nhad been taken to ascertain her landlord’s whereabouts. This led to the\nsolicitors tracing the second respondent Mrs Austin. Mrs Austin\nconfirmed that she was divorced from the first respondent, whom she\nbelieved to be living abroad. having lost contact with him. It is also\nbelieved that the first Respondent may have changed his name and may\nalso be known as Professor Karl Crossman.\n4. Mrs Austin confirmed through her solicitors Anthony King via an email\ndated 17 January 2019, that she was willing to grant an extension of\nthe lease, subject to the agreement of the first respondent’s trustee.\n5. Notice of the claim was served pursuant to an order of District Judge\nNaidoo dated 2 February 2021 at the last known addresses for the\nRespondents. The matter was then listed for hearing firsts on 12 May\n2021, and then on 8 July 2021. Neither respondent appeared or was\notherwise represented.\n6. On 8 July 2021, neither respondent appeared, District Judge Manners\nmade an order that the claimant is entitled to acquire the premises on\nsuch terms as may be determined by the First-tier (Property Chamber)\n2\n\nas if the Applicant had, at the date of this claim given notice under\nsection 452 of the 1993 Act to exercise the right to acquire a new lease.\n“ 3. The aforesaid vesting is subject to the Chief Land Registrar\ndisapplying (or otherwise disregarding) the restriction of 7 May 1890\nthat is against the freehold of the house.”\n7. On 4.08.2021, the Applicant applied to the tribunal for a determination\nof the premium and terms of acquisition. Directions were given and the\nmatter was set down for a paper determination.\n8. The Applicants’ provided the Tribunal with a bundle of documents, and a\nvaluation from Mr Tim J Henson BSc, MRICS, RICs Surveyor comprising\n16 pages, dated 24 September 2021.\nThe issues\n9. The following matters were uncontentious :\n(a) The subject property is situated in a residential road off Forest\nRoad (A503) approximately 0.7 miles from Wood Street\noverground station. St John’s Road is located near the shopping\nfacilities of Walthamstow and the underground station (\napproximately 1 mile away. It is also subject to controlled\nparking with residents parking permits.\n(b) The premises is a 1 bedroomed flat, on the first floor in a\nconverted terraced building, with one other flat on the ground\nfloor.\n(c) The Flat entrance is on the ground floor comprises an entrance\nhall, private entrance and stairs to a landing, reception room\nwith bay, double bedroom, bathroom/WC and a kitchen with a\nGIA of approximately 54.36 square metres (585.14 ft).\n(d) The valuation date: 27 September 2019\n(e) Details of the tenants’ leasehold interests:\n(i) The property is held under a lease dated 7 October 1986, for\na term of 99 years. The unexpired lease is 65.26 years. The\nground rent is £50.00 pa.\n(ii) Condition of the property- The property is in good\ncondition with a replacement of the bathroom, kitchen and the\ninstallation of central heating since the lease was granted.\n3\n\nThe Determination\n10. The Paper Determination of this matter took place on 1 November\n2021.\n11. None of the parties asked the tribunal to inspect the property and the\nTribunal did not consider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection\nto make its determination.\n12. The Applicants relied upon the expert report produced by Mr Tim J\nHenson .\n13. Mr Henson considered the market conditions at the valuation dated as\nset out in the Uk Residential Marketing Survey for September 2019.\nThe market was described as broadly flat, with near term sales standing\nat -9%, with a predicted three month decline of -16%.\n14. Mr Henson had considered 4 comparable flats 3 ground floor, and 1\nfirst floor, 2-bedroom flat, with sale dated of 31.1.2019 to 12.09.2019\n9.07.2019. The sales prices ranged for £270,000 to £342,000\n15. Although the flats were of a similar age and style and in the same or on\nan adjoining road. The ground floor comparables, had their own\ngardens. Only one flat, 3A Victoria Road, was a one-bedroom, flat\nselling on 9.07.2019 at £270,000.\n16. Mr Henson described flat 4 of his comparables 26 Victoria Road which\nwas a two-bedroom flat with sole use of the garden and 89 years\nunexpired lease term, as an “outlier” as although it was in very good\ncondition, it was smaller than the subject flat at 48.9m2.\n17. In paragraph 4.3.4 Mr Henson stated that his was of the opinion that\nthe range of value is £5,250m2 - £5.750m2 which equates to a value of\n£285,390- £312,570. He stated that having done a “sense check”\nallowing for the size of the flat he would value it at £300,000.\n18. In paragraph 4.1.1 of his report he set out the difficulties that he had of\nobtaining direct comparables of short and long lease sales. He had\ntherefore adopted a relativity by reference to Zucconi and taken an\naverage of the Gerald Eve and Savills Enfranchiseable Graph of\n80.04% +79.95%= 79.995 say 80%.\n19. Mr Henson adopted a deferment rate of 5% following the decision in\nSportelli and a capitalisation rate of 7%.\n20. In his calculations he adopted a 1% uplift for the difference between the\nlong leasehold value and the freehold value of the premises. In his\n4\n\ncalculations the freeholder’s interest was £13,255 and the leaseholder’s\ninterest in the un-extended lease £242,400. The marriage value was\ncalculated at £44,500, with the freeholder’s share being £22,250. Mr\nHenson had rounded the premium down to £35,500 for the lease\nextension.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n• The Tribunal determines that the appropriate premium payable\nto the freeholder for the lease extension is £35,350.00\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n21. The Tribunal in reaching its decision accepted Mr Henson’s’ evidence\nas set out in his report. The Tribunal considered the valuation for the\nflat. It accepted the calculations provided by Mr Henson, and adopted\na capitalisation rate of 7%, and a deferment rate of 5%. The Tribunal\nalso adopted a relativity of 80%.\n22. The value of the reversion was considered by the Tribunal, although the\nTribunal used the same deferment rate as Mr Jones, it arrived at a\nfigure for the valuation of £303,000.The Tribunal adopted the\ncapitalisation rate of 7% of the ground rent at 65.26 giving a figure of\n£706.00. The value of the landlord’s interest after the lease extension is\n£155.00 The Tribunal adopted the Deferment rate of 5% at 65,26 to\nproducing a vacant possession value of £12,550.00.\n23. The Tribunal has adopted Mr Henson’s valuation and has determined\nthat the existing lease value is £255,655, producing a marriage value of\n£44,500. The Respondent’s share of the marriage value is £22,250.\nProducing a premium of £35,350.00\nThe premium\n• The tribunal determines the appropriate premium to be\n£35,350\n• The Tribunal’s calculations are provided in the annexe.\n5\n\nName: Judge Daley Date:\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n6\n\nValuation for lease extension\n101b St Johns Road, London, E17 4JH\nValuation Date 27/09/2019\nLease\n01/01/1986\nCommencement\nLease Term 99.00 years Expiry 31/12/2084\nUnexpired Term 65.26 years\nLong Lease value £300,000\nFreehold VP value £303,000 +1% long lease value\nTerm 1 Term 2 Term 3\nGround rent £50.00 £0.00 £0.00\nReversion years 65.26 0.00 0.00\nCapitalisation rate 7%\nDeferment rate 5%\nCompensation £0.00\nRelativity 80.00%\nDiminution of Landlord's interest\nGround rent £50\nYP 65.26 yrs @ 7.00% 14.11300463\n£706\nRent Review 1 £0\nYP 0.00 yrs @ 7.00% 0\nPV of £1 65.26 yrs @ 7.00% 0.012089676\n£0\nRent Review2 £0\nYP 0.00 yrs @ 7.00% 0\nPV of £1 65.26 yrs @ 7.00% 0.012089676\n£0\nReversion to VP value £303,000\nPV 65.26 yrs @ 5.00% 0.04141773\n£12,550\n£13,255\nValue existing freehold\nL/lord's interest on reversion of new lease\nFH VP £303,000\nPV 155.26 yrs @ 5.00% 0.00051304\n-£155\n£13,100\nLandlord's share of Marriage Value\n7\n\nVal.

This is an application made by the Applicant under section 91 of the Leasehold\nReform, Housing and Urban and Development Act 1993 (as amended) (“the\nAct”) for a determination of the statutory costs payable to the Respondent\nunder section 60 of the Act for the grant of separate new leases in relation to\nthe properties known as 72 and 59 Park West, Edgware Road, London, W2\n2QJ (“the properties”).\n2. The Applicant is the leaseholder owner of the properties. The Respondent is\nthe freeholder and the competent landlord for the purposes of the Act.\n3. Both lease extension transactions ran in parallel following the requisite section\n42 and 45 notices having been served by the parties. It seems that agreement\nwas reached both in relation to the lease premiums and terms.\n4. Therefore, it is important to note that these transactions can be regarded as\nbeing straightforward statutory lease extensions. Indeed, it appears that the\nRespondent has granted 123 such new leases out of the freehold title of the\nbuilding in which the properties are situated.\n5. The costs claimed by the Respondent for granting the new leases are £3,792.60\nand £3,895.20 including VAT and disbursements respectively.\n6. The parties were unable to agree the Respondent’s costs and the Applicant\nmade an application to the Tribunal seeking a determination of statutory costs\npayable to the Respondent pursuant to Section 60 of the Act.\nRelevant Statutory Provision\n7. Section 60 of the Act provides:\nCosts incurred in connection with new lease to be paid by tenant.\n(1) Where a notice is given under section 42, then (subject to the provisions of\nthis section) the tenant by whom it is given shall be liable, to the extent that\nthey have been incurred by any relevant person in pursuance of the notice,\nfor the reasonable costs of and incidental to any of the following matters,\nnamely—\n(a) any investigation reasonably undertaken of the tenant's right to a new\nlease;\n(b) any valuation of the tenant's flat obtained for the purpose of fixing the\npremium or any other amount payable by virtue of Schedule 13 in\nconnection with the grant of a new lease under section 56;\n(c) the grant of a new lease under that section;\nbut this subsection shall not apply to any costs if on a sale made\nvoluntarily a stipulation that they were to be borne by the purchaser\nwould be void.\n2\n\n3\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) any costs incurred by a relevant person in\nrespect of professional services rendered by any person shall only be\nregarded as reasonable if and to the extent that costs in respect of such\nservices might reasonably be expected to have been incurred by him if the\ncircumstances had been such that he was personally liable for all such costs.\n(3) Where by virtue of any provision of this Chapter the tenant's notice ceases\nto have effect, or is deemed to have been withdrawn, at any time, then\n(subject to subsection (4)) the tenant's liability under this section for costs\nincurred by any person shall be a liability for costs incurred by him down to\nthat time.\n(4) A tenant shall not be liable for any costs under this section if the tenant's\nnotice ceases to have effect by virtue of section 47(1) or 55(2).\n(5) A tenant shall not be liable under this section for any costs which a party to\nany proceedings under this Chapter before a leasehold valuation tribunal\nincurs in connection with the proceedings.\n(6) In this section \"relevant person\", in relation to a claim by a tenant under\nthis Chapter, means the landlord for the purposes of this Chapter, any other\nlandlord (as defined by section 40(4)) or any third party to the tenant's\nlease.\nDecision\n8. The Tribunal’s determination took place on 26 June 2023 and was based\nsolely on the written representations filed by the parties. The Tribunal’s\napproach was to conduct what effectively amounts to a summary assessment\nof the costs.\n9. As stated earlier, this matter relates to the Respondent’s costs incurred in what\ncan be described as “standard” statutory lease extensions with no particular\ncomplication.\nAgreed Costs\n10. Valuation costs of £1,440 including VAT per flat (£2,880 in total) and Land\nRegistry fees £39.60 including VAT (Flat 72) and £14.40 (Flat 593).\nFee Earner & Hourly Rate\n11. The Applicant’s challenge to the reasonableness of the Respondent’s legal costs\nis based on the grade of fee earner and the hourly rate claimed.\n12. The majority of the work was carried out by a Partner at an hourly rate of £575\nwho was assisted by an Assistant Solicitor at an hourly rate of £425. The\n3\n\n4\noverall attendance claimed in respect of Flat 72 is 6.5 hours and 6.8 hours in\nrespect of Flat 593. The attendances claimed do not appear to be challenged\nby the Applicant.\n13. By reference to the current guideline hourly rates, the Applicant submitted\nthat the hourly rates claimed are unreasonable. In respect of both\ntransactions, the Applicant submitted that the work should have been carried\nout by a Grade B fee earner and for a firm located in the London Band 2 area, a\nreasonable hourly rate is £300-325 per hour.\n14. Unsurprisingly, the Respondent submitted that both the hourly rates claimed\nand grade of fee earner are reasonable and referred to other decided Tribunal\ncosts cases when this was approved.\n14. Whilst this may have appeared to be a relatively straightforward matter, the\nTribunal’s view was that this is a highly technical area of law conducted by the\nApplicant’s solicitors with the requisite knowledge and experience in this field\nof work.\n15. However, as stated earlier, these were relatively straightforward lease\nextension transactions and, therefore, the Tribunal concluded that the work\ndid not need to be carried out by a Partner. The Tribunal was satisfied that it\ncould have been carried out by a Grade B fee earner.\n16. As to the hourly rate, the Tribunal accepted the Applicant’s submission that\nthis should be calculated by reference to the guideline hourly rates for\nsolicitors. Whilst, the Tribunal notes that the rates are no more than guideline\nrates, they provide a useful starting point for assessment. In this instance,\nthere are no particular reasons to depart from them.\n17. The fact that the grade of fee earner and hourly rates claimed may have been\napproved in other Tribunal decisions does not provide the Respondent with\nany assistance in this instance for two main reasons. Firstly, each case is fact\nspecific. Secondly, other Tribunal decisions do not bind this Tribunal and they\ndo not establish a precedent.\n18. Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that the appropriate rate for a Grade B fee\nearner in the London Band 2 area is £300 per hour.

The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to be\nregistered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum fair\nrent."

It contains two residential blocks, Foundling Court and\nO’Donnell Court (“the Blocks”). Foundling Court contains 210 flats and\nsix office units. O’Donnell Court contains 185 flats and seven office units.\nIt also includes an upper basement NCP car park and a lower basement\ncomprising residential parking and service roads.\n(4) The Respondent (“Camden”) holds a head lease (“the Head Lease”) of\nFoundling Court and O’Donnell Court dated 26 February 1982, entered\ninto between (1) Marchmont Properties Limited and (2) The London\nBorough of Camden, for a term of 99 years from 5 December 1973.\nUnder the terms of the Head Lease, Camden is obliged to pay a service\ncharge of 25% of the total cost of items of expenditure referred to in the\nFourth Schedule of the Head Lease, as incurred by the Head Landlord, in\ndischarging its obligations under the Head Lease.\n2\n\n(5) Camden has granted three types of long leases to the residential lessees\nof flats in the Blocks, known respectively as ‘Type A’, ‘Type B’ and ‘Type\nC Leases’. On 23 May 1988, Camden granted Mrs Ramsaroop and her\nhusband (now deceased) a Type A Lease of the subject flat (“the Flat”)\nfor a term of 99 years from 5 December 1973.\n(6) The Type B and Type C Leases make express provision for the residential\nunderlessee to contribute towards the Head Landlord’s costs incurred in\ndischarging its obligations under the Head Lease. No equivalent\nprovision was made in the Type A Leases.\nMrs Ramsaroop’s Lease\n(7) In the Respondent’s Type A Lease, the lessee is referred to as “the\nTenant”, and Camden is referred to as “the Corporation”. The Head\nLandlord is referred to as “the Superior Lessor”.\n(8) The building is defined in Clause 1 as being the building “known as\nO’Donnell Court Brunswick Centre London WC1”.\n(9) By Clause 1, Flat 63 (“the Flat”) was demised to Mr and Mrs Ramsaroop\nfor a term of 99 years less 5 days upon payment of “a yearly rent of\n£10.00 and the further and additional rent hereinafter mentioned to be\npaid by equal quarterly payments in advance on the Corporations\nquarter days in every year………”.\n(10) By Clause 2(3) the Tenant covenants:\n“To pay to the Corporation without any deduction by way of further and\nadditional rent a proportionate part of the reasonable expenses and\noutgoings including all VAT incurred by the Corporation in the repair\nmaintenance renewal decoration and insurance and management of the\nsaid building and the provision of services therein and the other heads\nof expenditure as the same are set out in the Third Schedule hereto\nsuch further and additional rent (hereinafter called the “Service\nCharge”) being subject to the following terms and provisions….”\n(11) Clause 2(3)(a) concerns finalisation of the actual service charges for each\nyear and reads as follows:\n“(a) the amount of the Service Charge shall be ascertained and certified\nby a Certificate (hereinafter called “the Certificate”) signed by the\nCorporation’s Director of Finance acting as an expert and not as an\narbitrator annually and so soon after the end of the Corporation’s\nfinancial year as may be practicable and shall relate to such year in\nmanner hereinafter mentioned”.\n(12) The financial year is defined in Clause 2(3)(b) as being the period from 1\nApril in each year to the 31 March of the next year, or such other annual\nperiod as the Corporation determines.\n3\n\n(13) Clause 2(3)(c) states that a copy of the Certificate for each financial year\nis to be supplied by Camden to the tenant on written request and without\ncharge.\n(14) Clause 2(3)(d) specifies that the Certificate is to contain a summary of\nCamden’s expenses and outgoings incurred in the financial year to which\nit relates, together with a summary of the relevant details and figured\nforming the basis of the Service Charge and the Certificate.\n(15) Apportionment of the Service Charge is addressed in Clause 2(3)(e)\nwhich reads:\n“The annual amount of the Service Charge payable by the Tenant as\naforesaid shall be calculated either by\n(i) dividing the aggregate of the said expenses and outgoings\nincurred by the (Corporation in the year to which the Certificate\nrelates by the aggregate of the rateable values (in force at the end\nof such year) of all the flats the repair maintenance renewal\ninsurance or servicing whereof is charged in such calculation as\naforesaid and then multiplying the resultant amount by the\nrateable value (in force at the same date) of the flat or\n(ii) in the case of the items referred to in Clauses 5 10 and 11 of the\nThird Schedule hereto the provision of lighting to all communal\nareas the cost of repair and maintenance of any lift or lift shaft\nand the provisions of any refuse containers or sacks by dividing\nthe total cost of each of the services referred to in this sub-Clause\nby the total number of flats for which such service is provided.”\n(16) Clause 2(3)(g) obliges the Tenant, if required by Camden, to pay with\nevery quarterly payment of rent, “such sum in advance on account of the\nService Charge as the Corporation shall specify at its discretion to be a\nfair and reasonable interim payment”.\n(17) By Clause 3(2) Camden covenants, “subject to the same not being the\nresponsibility of the Superior Lessor under the terms of the Head Lease”\nto maintain repair decorate renew amend clean etc: (a) the structure of\nthe building; (b) service media in under and upon the building; (c)\nboilers, heating and hot water apparatus in the building except those\nserving exclusively the flat and not part of a general heating system; (d)\npassenger lifts, lift shafts and machinery and the passages landings and\nstaircases used by the Tenant in common with others; and (e) boundary\nwalls and fences of and in the curtilage of the building.\n(18) By Clause 3(3) Camden covenants to keep reasonably clean and lighted\nthe common parts of the building and to keep clean and tidy and to\nmaintain the gardens, forecourts, roadways, pathways (if any) used in\nconnection with the said building or adjoining or adjacent thereto being\nthe property of the Corporation.\n4\n\n(19) By Clause 3(4) Camden covenants to provide hot water for domestic\npurposes by means of the communal boiler and heating installations\nserving the Estate as well as heating to the radiators from 1 October to 30\nApril in each year.\n(20) By Clause 3(5) Camden covenants as follows:\n“Provided that the Superior Lessor shall not insure from time to time to\ncomprehensively insure and keep insured the said building and\nlandlord’s fixtures therein against loss or damage by fire and such other\nrisks as are usual in a comprehensive insurance policy for a property\nsuch as the Building….”\n(21) The Third Schedule is entitled “The Corporation’s Expenses and\nOutgoings and other Heads of Expenditure in respect of which the\nTenant is to pay a Proportionate Part by way of Service Charge”. It\ncomprises 13 paragraphs. Included are the costs of: (a) maintaining\nrepairing etc the building; (b) inspecting, maintaining, repairing etc. the\ndomestic hot water, electricity, gas and water pipes and cables as well as\nthe lifts serving the building; (c) insuring the building; (d) employing\nand providing accommodation for a caretaker in the building; carpeting,\nredecorating etc the common parts of the building; (e) any charges,\nassessments or other outgoings payable by the Camden in respect of all\nparts of the building; repairing etc and lighting all ways roads etc\nbelonging to or used by the building in common with other premises or\nadjoining thereto; the upkeep of gardens etc (if any) used in connection\nwith the building or adjoining or adjacent thereto; and Camden’s\nmanagement charges for the building and for general management of the\nestate in which the building is situated at the rate of 10% if all other\nitems included in the service charge.\n(22) Paragraph 1 of the Third Schedule allows for the recovery of:\n“The expenses of maintaining repairing redecorating and renewing\namending cleaning ….the said building and all parts thereof…..belonging\nand more particularly described in Clause 3(2) hereof”.\n(23) Paragraph 2 allows for the recovery of:\n“The cost of periodically inspecting maintaining overhauling repairing\nand where necessary replacing the whole of the heating and domestic hot\nwater systems and gas electricity and water pipes and cables serving the\nsaid building….”.\n(24) Paragraph 3 allows for the recovery of:\n“The cost (if any) of the gas oil electricity or other fuel required for the\nbuilder (sic) or boilers supplying the heating and domestic hot water\nsystems serving the said building…….”\n(25) Paragraph 4 allows for the recovery of “the cost of insuring and keeping\ninsured….the said building and all parts thereof….”\n5\n\n(26) Paragraph 9 allows for the recovery of:\n“The cost of the expense of making repairing maintaining rebuilding\ncleansing and lighting all ways roads pavements sewers drains pipes\nwatercourses party structures party fences walls or other convenience\nwhich may belong to or be used for the said building in common with\nother premises near or adjoining thereto”.\nPrevious Litigation\n(27) In application LON/00AG/LSC/2014/0661 some of the residential\nlessees with Type A Leases disputed their liability to contribute towards\ncosts payable by Camden to the Head Landlord and sought a\ndetermination under s.27A Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 as to the\npayability of service charges demanded from them by Camden (“the 2014\nService Charge application”).\n(28) Because of the scale and complexity of some of the issues raised in the\n2014 Service Charge Application, the application was transferred to the\nUpper Tribunal which, in a decision dated 10 August 2016 (Leaseholders\nof Foundling Court & O’Donnell Court v London Borough of Camden &\nOrs [2016] UKUT 366 (LC), determined several preliminary issues,\nincluding whether, when a tenant of a dwelling is obliged to pay a service\ncharge to his or her immediate landlord in respect of the cost of works\ncarried out by a superior landlord, the statutory consultation\nrequirements imposed by Part 2 of Schedule 4 of the Service Charges\n(Consultation Requirements) (England) Regulations 2003 must be\nsatisfied by the superior landlord or by the immediate landlord.\n(29) The parties to the 2014 Service Charge Application subsequently reached\na settlement in which the lessees who were a party to the application\nagreed to vary their Type A Leases to bring them in line with the\nprovisions of the Type B and C Leases as regards recovery of Head\nLandlord’s costs. After that settlement, several other lessees with Type A\nLeases, but not Mr and Mrs Ramsaroop, agreed to the variation sought\nby Camden when their leases were extended under the Leasehold\nReform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.\n(30) In response to the 2014 Service Charge Application, Camden issued an\napplication (LON/00AG/LVT/2015/0005) to this tribunal to vary the\nterms of the remaining 28 Type A Leases pursuant to section 35 of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1987, to make the same provision for recovery\nof the Head Landlord’s costs as provided for in the Type B and Type C\nleases (“the Lease Variation Application”). The only lessee who played an\nactive part in that application was Mrs Ramsaroop. Camden’s primary\nargument was one of construction. It argued that Mrs Ramsaroop was\nrequired to make the contributions sought, without the need for any\nvariation of her lease. The argument for a variation under section 35 was\na secondary argument, relevant only if the appellant failed on its primary\nargument.\n6\n\n(31) In a decision dated 12 August 2019, I rejected Camden’s primary\nargument, finding that unless there was express provision to the contrary\nin her lease, Mrs Ramsaroop’s obligation to contribute costs towards\nHead Landlord’s costs was limited to costs incurred in respect of\nO’Donnell Court, and not the wider Estate (as defined as defined in\nClause 4(e) of the Head Lease). Camden’s appeal against that decision\nwas refused by the Judge Cooke in London Borough of Camden v\nMorath [2019] UKUT 193 (LC).\nCurrent Proceedings\n(32) The first two applications listed above concern County Court claims\nissued by Camden which have been transferred to the tribunal. Because\nof those transfers, the tribunal is required to make determinations under\nsection 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 as to whether\nestimated service charges are payable by Ms Ramsaroop for the service\ncharge years ending 31 March 2014 (Claim F40YX953) and 31 March\n2016 (Claim C5DE906Q).\n(33) The third application referred to above (LON/AG/LSC/2019/0357) is a\ntribunal application issued by Camden on 16 September 2019, seeking a\ndetermination as to Mrs Ramsaroop’s liability to pay actual service\ncharge costs incurred for the service charge years 2013/14 to 2018/19\nand the estimated costs for 2019/20.\n(34) The consequence of these several sets of proceedings is that I am\nrequired to determine Mrs Ramsaroop’s liability to pay to Camden:\n(a) estimated service charge costs for the service charge years ending 31\nMarch 2014 and 31 March 2016;\n(b) actual service charge costs for the years ending 31 March 2014 to 31\nMarch 2019 inclusive; and\n(c) estimated service charge costs for the year ending 31 March 2020.\n(35) I previously issued directions regarding these applications on 12 August\n2019 [A609], 17 October 2019 [A620] and 13 February 2020 [A625].\nIn the 12 August 2019 directions, I directed that as the whole of the two\nCounty Court claims had been transferred to the tribunal, that the judge\nwho eventually heard the cases, would deal with all the issues in the\ntransferred claims that fall within the jurisdiction of the County Court\nalone, namely ground rent, interest and costs, under the tribunal’s\nDeployment Project, sitting as a County Court judge. However, at the\nCase Management Hearing (“CMH”) on 13 February 2020, I informed\nthe parties that I considered there were now difficulties with doing so, as\nthere are two sets of County Court claims and one tribunal claim to be\ndetermined. As costs were only claimed in one of the County Court\nclaims, apportionment of costs across the cases would be practically\ndifficult.\n7\n\n(36) I therefore directed that at the final hearing of these applications the\ntribunal would determine only the question of payability of service\ncharges, and the judge will sit only as a tribunal judge. I also indicated\nthat after issue of the tribunal’s decision, either party may request that\nthe judge, sitting as a judge of the County Court, separately determines,\nliability to pay ground rent, interest and costs. If no such application is\nmade, those issues will be remitted back to the County Court.\n(37) Following the 12 August 2019 directions, Camden served a statement of\ncase [A81], together with a Scott Schedule showing a breakdown of the\nannual service charge payable by Mrs Ramsaroop [A99], and Mrs\nRamsaroop served a Statement of Case in response [A308], together\nwith a copy of the Scott Schedule with her manuscript responses\n[A306]. At the 13 February 2020 CMH, an examination of Mrs\nRamsaroop’s Scott Schedule and Statement of Case led me to conclude\nthat the issues for the tribunal to determine were as follows:\n(a) have the service charge costs in question been properly demanded\nfrom Mrs Ramsaroop in accordance with the provisions of her lease,\nincluding whether Camden has complied with the certification\nrequirements in Clause 2(3)(a)?\n(b) have: (i) heating, hot water, and gas supply costs; and (ii) insurance\ncosts been apportioned according to the provisions of her lease.\n(c) are Camden contractually entitled to recover the following costs\nunder the provisions of Mrs Ramsaroop’s lease, as identified in the\nCamden’s service charge statements and in its Scott Schedule? Mrs\nRamsaroop’s position appeared to be that they are only payable by\nher to the extent that they can be attributed to O’Donnell Court, and\nnot the wider Estate:\n(i) Caretaking Services – Estate;\n(ii) Electricity charges – Estate;\n(iii) Fire Protection Equipment – Estate;\n(iv) Lighting Maintenance – Estate; and\n(v) Repairs and Maintenance – Estate.\n(d) whether costs in respect of (i) ‘Caretaking services – Block’ and\nheating; and (ii) ‘heating/hot water/gas supply’ were reasonable in\namount and whether caretaking services have been carried out to a\nproper standard. These were the only challenges made to the\namount of costs incurred or to quality of services; and\n(e) is Mrs Ramsaroop liable to pay the costs identified as (Head)\nLandlord’s costs in Camden’s Scott Schedule. Her case was that she\nis only liable where if costs were incurred for the benefit to\nO’Donnell Court.\n8\n\n(38) After the 17 October 2019 directions, Camden served an amended\nStatement of Case dated 8 November 2019 [A330] and an amended\nScott Schedule. Mrs Ramsaroop then served a revised Statement of Case\n[A510] and a revised Scott Schedule [A546]. Camden also served a\nwitness statement from Geraldine Littlechild, a Finance and Income\nManager employed by Camden, dated 24 April 2020 [A638] in which\nMs Littlechild responded to Mrs Ramsaroop’s revised Scott Schedule.\n(39) In an email to the tribunal dated 3 June 2020, Camden’s solicitor, Mr\nOakley, stated that Camden had “due to reasons of proportionality and\ncost, withdrawn its claim against Mrs Ramsaroop in respect of the\nFreeholder’s costs claimed through the Applicant’s service charge under\nthe heading “Landlord’s Costs”.\n(40) Mr Oakley went on to say that as several items of costs charged had not\nbeen challenged by Mrs Ramsaroop, and the fields for Mrs Ramsaroop's\nchallenge in the Scott Schedule had been left blank, Camden was\nproceeding, and its evidence was served, upon the basis that such items\nare not in dispute. The solicitor stated that when Mrs Ramsaroop was\nasked to confirm this replied she as follows\n“I apologise for responding so late to your email below. This\nis because I have been without legal representation from the\nlast CMC meeting. And due to the Covid 19 virus I have been\nin self isolation making matters even worst in addition to my\nmany underlying health issues. I hope you understand that I\nhave not been deliberately evasive but have done my best\nunder the challenging circumstances.\nThe items left blank in the Scott schedule are still contested by\nmyself to the extent that they fall within the issues set out in\nparagraph 6 of Judge Vance’s summary. In particular but\nnot limited to 6(a).”\n(41) Mr Oakley stated that in the absence of a challenge to the several of the\nservice charge costs, Camden was proceeding on the basis that such\nitems were only challenged under Mrs Ramsaroop’s generic challenge on\ncertification and form of demand.\n(42) Mrs Ramsaroop then provided a witness statement dated 17 July 2020\n[A716]. On 5 August 2020, the tribunal’s case officer wrote to the\nparties, at my request [A635], as follows:\n“Both parties have requested that this application be determined\non the documents provided and without an oral hearing. I\nwould not normally have agreed to this but given Mrs\nRamsaroop’s difficulties with attending an oral hearing during\nthis pandemic, whether in person, or by way of a remote\nhearing, and the length of time this dispute has been ongoing, I\nwill agree to the proposal. Having reviewed the witness\nstatements of the parties I agree with the Camden that the\n9\n\nfactual issues in dispute are limited in scope and that they can\nfairly be dealt with by way of written questions and answers,\nrather than formal cross examination.\nI therefore direct as follows:\n(a) by 28 August 2020:\n(i) Camden may write to the tribunal, by email, with\na list of questions that they wish to ask Mrs\nRamsaroop in respect of the evidence contained\nin her witness statement dated 17 July 2020 and\nmay ask her to produce any documents in her\npossession or control which relate to any issue in\nthe proceedings; and\n(ii) Mrs Ramsaroop may write to the tribunal, by\nemail, with a list of questions that they wish to\nask Ms Littlechild in respect of the evidence\ncontained in her witness statement dated 24 April\n2020 and may ask her to produce any documents\nin Camden’s possession or control which relate to\nany issue in the proceedings.\n(b) Upon receipt of any questions provided by the parties in\naccordance with the previous direction, I will consider\nmaking an order under Rule 20(1)(b) of the Tribunal\nProcedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules\n2013 and will issue further directions for the determination\nof the application.”\n(43) Mr Oakley wrote to the tribunal on 7 September 2020 [A595] raising\nfour questions. No questions were raised by Mrs Ramsaroop. On 18\nSeptember 2020 I made an order under Rule 20(1)(b) [A637] requiring\nMrs Ramsaroop to answer the four questions raised in Mr Oakley’s letter\nof 7 September 2020 by 2 October 2020, following which the application\nwould be determined based on the written documents provided by the\nparties. She did so by letter dated 2 October 2020 [A596].\n(44) When Camden lodged the bundle of documents for the tribunal’s\ndetermination it sought permission to rely upon a witness statement\nfrom Mr Dilip Shah, Acting Head of Caretaking & the Principal\nCaretaking Manager employed by Camden, dated 13 October 2020\n[A733], in which Mr Shah responded to Mrs Ramsaroop’s letter of 2\nOctober 2020. I gave that permission on 5 November 2020, and directed\nthat if Mrs Ramsaroop wished to make any written representations in\nresponse to Mr Shah’s statement, she should do so by sending these to\nthe tribunal and the Applicant by 16 November 2020. She responded on\n15 November 2020.\n10\n\nMrs Ramsaroop’s Case\n(45) These claims have progressed over several years and Mrs Ramsaroop\nhas, on various opportunities, been accorded the opportunity to set out\nher arguments against the payability of the service charges claimed by\nthe Applicant. It would not assist to set out in detail the historic\nchallenges raised. Instead, I proceed on the basis that her case, as\ncurrently pursued, is that articulated in her witness statement dated 17\nJuly 2020 (prepared with the assistance of the Bar Pro Bono Charity)\n[A716], her revised Statement of Case [A510] and her revised Scott\nSchedule [A546].\n(46) In her witness statement and revised Statement of Case, Mrs Ramsaroop\nargues as follows:\n(a) the Applicant cannot rely merely on the general words in Clause\n2(3) as founding the Service Charge liability. It must be able to\ndemonstrate that each item in respect of which the service charge\nis claimed (including Estate costs) also falls within at least one of\nthe paragraphs set out in the Third Schedule;\n(b) the Applicant has not demanded service charges in accordance\nwith the provisions of her Lease. She maintains that as Clause 1 of\nthe Lease obliges her to pay “the further and additional rent\nhereinafter mentioned by equal quarterly payments in advance on\nthe Corporation quarter days….” all service charge demands, both\nin respect of costs already incurred and sums demanded by way of\nadvance payments, should stipulate quarterly payments. She\ncontends that she has not received quarterly demands as required\nby her Lease and nor has the Applicant complied with Clause\n2(3)(a) of her Lease as she has not been provided with Certificates\nsigned by the Applicant’s Director of Finance;\n(c) with regard to heating, hot water, gas supply and insurance\ncharges, the Applicant has not apportioned the sums payable by\nher in accordance with the provisions of Clause 2(3)(e)(i) of her\nThe Applicant considers the apportionment method adopted by\nthe Applicant incorrectly divides the costs incurred by the rateable\nvalue of the Estate, and then multiplies the resulting figure by the\nproperty rateable value. She appears to be arguing that the costs\nincurred should be divided by the rateable value of O’Donnell\nCourt, as opposed to the whole Estate.\n(d) Although, in her Scott Schedule, she states that the sums\ndemanded for heating, hot water and gas supply are excessive, she\ndoes not expand on that bare statement in her statements of case\nor her witness statement. There is no evidence to support a\nchallenge that these costs are excessive in amount and, to the\nextent that such an argument is pursued, if at all, I reject it.\n(47) Her challenges to the individual heads of expenditure, as set out in her\nwitness statement, are:\n11\n\n(a) Caretaking (Block costs) – over a period of many years, the\nstandard of caretaking services has been poor, in particular, the\nhallway from the lift to her flat is covered in large amounts of bird\ndroppings. She also contends that: (i) communal hallways are\nsubject to regular flooding during rainfall due to poor drainage;\n(ii) there is a problem of mice and cockroach infestation in the\nblock due to the rubbish that is left near the communal rubbish\nchute and by the lifts which is rarely addressed by the Caretaker;\n(iii) the level of service provided does not justify the costs\nincurred; and (iv) apportionment of caretaking costs should be as\nper the rateable value calculation set out in her Lease.\n(b) Caretaking (Estate costs) – no Estate costs are payable by her,\nonly caretaking services in respect of her Block, O’Donnell Court,\nas per paragraph 5 of the Third Schedule\n(c) Electricity charges – (Estate costs) - no Estate costs are payable by\nher, only electricity costs in respect of her Block, O’Donnell Court.\nShe also suggests that lights are constantly blowing bulbs because\nlights are left running all day, incurring unnecessary electricity\ncosts;\n(d) Fire protection equipment – Estate costs - no Estate costs are\npayable by her, only the costs of equipment servicing her Block.\n(e) Lighting maintenance – Estate costs - no Estate costs are payable\nby her, only the costs of lighting maintenance regarding her Block,\nas per paragraph 1 of the Third Schedule, unless it can be shown\nthat the costs concern the lighting of “[...] ways roads pavements\n[etc] which may belong to or be used for the said building in\ncommon with other premises near or adjoining thereto” under\nparagraph 9 of the Third Schedule.\n(f) Repairs and maintenance – Estate costs - no Estate costs are\npayable by her, only the costs of repairs and maintenance in\nrespect of the Block, as per paragraph 1 of the Third Schedule. She\nidentifies certain specific costs that she argues are unrelated to\nO’Donnell Court, and therefore not payable by her.\n(g) Repairs and maintenance – Block costs – although initially\ndisputed, following breakdowns provided by the Applicant, Mrs\nRamsaroop concedes that these costs are recoverable as part of\nthe Service Charge in the amounts claimed in the invoices, subject\nto her arguments regarding the invalidity of the demands issued\nby Camden. Although, in her Statement of Case, Mrs Ramsaroop\nrefers to a potential disrepair claim concerning water leaks into\nher flat, she did not pursue a counterclaim in either of the two\nCounty Court claims and she has not advanced the argument that\ncosts demanded from her have arisen because of historic neglect\nof her building by Camden.\n12\n\nCamden’s case\n(48) In its amended Statement of Case the Applicant states that Mrs\nRamsaroop has paid nothing towards service charges since 8 March\n2012, and that between 27 November 2014 and 4 March 2015 the\nApplicant has written off the sum of £22,165.80 from her service charge\naccount.\n(49) Most of the contents of the Applicant’s amended Statement of Case dated\n17 October 2019 [A330] is devoted to an explanation as to how the Head\nLandlord seeks service charge payments from Camden and how part of\nthe sums that Camden must pay to the Head Landlord are passed down\nto the residential lessees. However, Head Landlord costs are no longer\nrelevant to these applications following Camden’s solicitor, Mr Oakley\nconfirming, on 3 June 2020, that Applicant was withdrawing its claim\nagainst Mrs Ramsaroop in respect such costs.\n(50) In her witness statement dated 24 April 2020 [A638], Mrs Littlechild, a\nFinance and Income Manager employed by Camden, provides an\nexplanation as to what services are provided by Camden in respect of the\nheads of expenditure challenged by Mrs Ramsaroop in her revised\nStatement of Case and witness statement. She has also indicated why\nshe considers some of those costs are payable by Mrs Ramsaroop by\nfalling within one of the paragraphs of the Third Schedule.\n(51) In his short witness statement dated 13 October 2020, Mr Shah, the\nActing Head of Caretaking & Principal Caretaking Manager at Camden\nresponds to some of the points raised by Mrs Ramsaroop in her in her\nletter of 2 October 2020.\nReasons for Decision\n(52) I will first address Mrs Ramsaroop’s submission that Camden has not\ndemanded service charges in accordance with the provisions of her Lease\nbecause Clause 1 requires the provision of quarterly service charge\ndemands. That submission reflects a misunderstanding of the terms of\nher lease. It is quite correct that Clause 1 and Clause 2(3)(g) stipulate\nthat her payments are due on the quarter days in every year. However,\nCamden’s practice, common to many local authorities, is to issue a\ndemand in respect of the estimated service charge for the forthcoming\nservice charge year, shortly before commencement of that year, with a\nfurther demand, or credit note, being issued once the actual costs for the\nyear are ascertained, and the costs for the year reconciled. Camden is\nperfectly entitled to adopt such an approach provided that its demands\nindicate that payments are due on the quarter days.\n(53) That is what Camden has done. Its annual demands for estimated service\ncharges contains the following wording:\n“Paying your bill: Under the terms of the lease quarterly payments of\n£[amount] are due on 31 March, 30 June 30th September and 31\n13\n\nDecember [year]. Alternatively, you can pay by instalments over 10\nmonths.”\n(54) As to Mrs Ramsaroop’s contention that Applicant has not complied with\nthe Certification requirements of Clause 2(3)(a) because she was not\nprovided with Certificates signed by the Applicant’s Director of Finance,\nthere is no obligation on Camden to do so unless, and until, she makes a\nwritten request for a copy of the Certificate in accordance with Clause\n2(3)(c). Her obligation to pay the service charges demanded is not,\ntherefore, conditional on provision of a copy of the Certificate.\n(55) In any event, both Camden’s estimated service charge demands, and its\nreconciliation statements, include provision for “Certification\nAccounting and Audit”. There is nothing to suggest that Mrs Ramsaroop\nmade written requests for copies of the annual Certificates, and given\nthat the cost of auditing and certification appears on the demands and\nthe reconciliation statements, I am satisfied, on the balance of\nprobabilities, that Camden complied with its certification requirements\nunder the Lease.\n(56) Turning to Mrs Ramsaroop’s arguments on apportionment, she contends\nthat heating, hot water, gas supply and insurance charges have been\nincorrectly apportioned as the costs incurred should be divided by the\nrateable value of O’Donnell Court, as opposed to the whole Estate before\nthe resulting figure is multiplied by the rateable value of her Flat. I do\nnot agree.\n(57) Under Clause 2(3)(e)(i), Mrs Ramsaroop’s contribution towards these\ncosts are to be apportioned by dividing the aggregate of the cost incurred\nby Camden by the aggregate of the rateable values of all the flats that are\ncharged for the service, and then multiplying the resulting amount by the\nrateable value her flat.\n(58) The problem with Mrs Ramsaroop’s argument is that heating, hot water,\nand gas are supplied through a communal system servicing all the flats\non the Estate and not just O’Donnell Court. As Ms Littlechild makes clear\nin paragraphs 6.13 to 6.16 of her witness statement [A641] Camden\ndivides the total system cost incurred in respect of the Estate by the\nEstate rateable value and multiplies it by the rateable value of the Flat.\n(59) The total system cost to the Estate is the aggregate of the costs incurred\nby Camden in providing the services to the flats on the Estate. The Estate\nrateable value is the aggregate of the rateable values of all the flats in\nrespect of which the service is charged. It would not be correct to use the\nrateable value of O’Donnell Court alone, as Mrs Ramsaroop suggests,\nbecause the services are not just provided to her Block, they are provided\nto all the flats on the Estate, including the lessees of Foundling Court.\nThe requirements Clause 2(3)(e)(i) are therefore met, and the costs have\nbeen correctly apportioned.\n(60) The same is true in respect of the costs of insurance. As Ms Littlechild\nexplains at paragraph 7 of her witness statement, the insurance premium\n14\n\nconcerns only the residential units on the Estate. Camden therefore takes\nthe premium for insuring the Estate and divides it by a reduced rateable\nvalue which omits the commercial units on the Estate. It then multiplies\nthe resulting figure by the property rateable value. I consider this too\ncomplies with the requirements of Clause 2(3)(e)(i).\n(61) Mrs Ramsaroop’s challenges individual heads of service charge\nexpenditure, I agree with her that for a head of expenditure to be payable\nby her it needs to fall within at least one of the paragraphs set out in the\nThird Schedule. Camden’s case, as set out in Ms Littlechild’s witness\nstatement is that they do. It should be noted that except for block\ncaretaking costs, Mrs Ramsaroop has not disputed the services provided\nfor the costs in issue. Her argument is that the costs are not recoverable\nunder the terms of her Lease. I first consider the Estate costs that Mrs\nRamsaroop has disputed.\n(62) Caretaking (Estate costs) – Camden contends that these costs are\nrecoverable under paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule which provides for\nthe recovery of:\n“The cost of the expense of making repairing maintaining\nrebuilding cleansing and lighting all ways roads pavements\nsewers drains pipes watercourses party structures party\nfences walls or other convenience which may belong to or\nbe used for the said building in common with other\npremises near or adjoining thereto”.\n(63) At paragraph 9 of her witness statement, Ms Littlechild explains that\nrefuse placed in rubbish chutes is deposited in refuse bins at located in\nthe basement area. She states that the caretaker’s duties in respect of\nEstate cleaning include rotating the full refuse bins; sweeping and\nwashing the refuse areas in the basements; managing the storage of bulk\nitems to the basement areas; moving refuse bins/bulk items to\ndesignated collection points in the access road; cleaning passageways in\nthe basement areas leading to/from refuse chambers. These duties, she\nsays are distinct from Block caretaking costs which, at paragraph 8, she\nstates are set out in a schedule to be found at page [A684].\n(64) I agree with Camden that the Estate caretaking services described by Ms\nLittlechild at paragraph 9 of her witness statement fall within the ambit\nof paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule. As she explains in paragraph 3 of\nher witness statement, the basement areas of the Estate comprise an\nupper basement NCP car, as well as lower basement residential parking\nand service roads. Cleaning and maintaining the rubbish bins and the\npassageways leading to the refuse chambers in those basement areas, in\nmy judgment, constitute costs of maintaining or cleansing ways, roads,\nor pavements used by the residents of O’Donnell Court in common with\nother premises near or adjoining it.\n(65) Electricity charges – (Estate costs) – at paragraph 10 of her witness\nstatement Ms Littlechild describes the costs included in the Estate\n15\n\nlighting charge as comprising lighting to the basement corridors, refuse\nrooms, exit ramps and roads, to enable caretakers to undertake Estate\ncleaning to these areas. Camden contends that these costs are\nrecoverable under paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule. I agree, they\ncomprise the costs of lighting ways, roads and pavements or other\nconveniences which belong to the building or used in common with other\npremises near or adjoining it.\n(66) I do not consider it likely, as Mrs Ramsaroop suggests, that lights\nservicing the Estate are constantly blowing bulbs because lights are left\nrunning all day. There is no evidence to support that contention, nor her\nassertion that unnecessary electricity costs are being incurred because\nlights are left on all day. The assertion is vague and unparticularised and\nI reject it.\n(67) Fire protection equipment – Estate costs – at paragraph 11 of her witness\nstatement Ms Littlechild describes the costs included in this charge as\nbeing the carrying out of planned preventative maintenance, and repairs\nto fire protection installations and appliances located in the intake\ncupboards in the basement area, including monthly inspections to\nensure that the appliances are in proper position, and that any appliance\nwhich is damaged or discharged is replaced. She states that all\nextinguishers are inspected annually and each extinguisher and fire\nblanket is maintained, charged and replaced in accordance with\nstandards and statutory regulations.\n(68) Mrs Ramsaroop contends that she is only liable to contribute towards the\ncosts of equipment that serve O’Donnell Court, for which she is asked to\npay a separate contribution. I disagree. In my determination they are\nrecoverable as costs of maintaining ways roads pavements used by the\nresidents of O’Donnell Court in common with other premises near or\nadjoining it. The lower basement includes residential parking and service\nroads and regardless of whether Mrs Ramsaroop uses the residential\nparking area, it is clearly an area serving O’Donnell Court as well as\nneighbouring buildings, including Foundling Court.\n(69) Lighting maintenance – Estate costs - Ms Littlechild’s evidence, at\nparagraph 12 of her statement, is that this head of expenditure covers the\ncost of Planned Preventative Maintenance, and the carrying out of\nrepairs, to communal estate lighting and electrical installations. This\nincludes sensor elements, time switches voltage relays, as well as lighting\nto basement areas, corridors, bin rooms, access roads, car parks/covered\nareas lighting, and landlord’s plant room lighting, across the wider\nBrunswick Centre Estate.\n(70) In my determination, these costs described are recoverable under\nparagraph 9 of the Third Schedule as costs of maintenance or repairs to\nways, roads, pavements, or other conveniences that used for O’Donnell\nCourt, in common with other premises near or adjoining it on the wider\nEstate.\n16\n\n(71) Repairs and maintenance – Estate costs - at paragraph 13 of her witness\nstatement Ms Littlechild describes the costs included in this charge as\nbeing the cost of repairs and maintenance work to the Brunswick Estate,\ninclude the clearing of main drains/sewers, repairs to estate lights,\nrepairs in the basement area, repairs to boiler house, electrical switch\nroom repairs etc. Camden argues that these items are rechargeable under\nparagraph 9 of Third Schedule which allows for the recovery of costs that\ninclude the repairing, maintaining, cleansing and lighting etc of ways,\nroads, pavements, sewers, drains and pipes that belong to or are used for\nthe benefit of O’Donnell Court, in common with other premises near or\nadjoining it.\n(72) She describes these repairs as set out below:\n“2013/14\nRectify blockage to main stack at O’Donnell Court which leading (sic) to\nmain drainage in basement area.”.\n2014/15\n“Electrical testing to switch rooms located in basement area. Each switch\nroom supply (sic) electricity to the lifts; door entry systems; lighting to\ncommunal entrances, corridors and terraces; car park lighting; lighting\nto refuse rooms, exit ramps and roads; power to plant rooms, sewage\npumps, risers, CCTV, extractor fans etc. Costs relating to all meters are\naggregated and apportioned based on the number of lights connected to\neach meter.\nRectify blockage to communal waste pipes at Foundling Court leading to\nservice road and NCP car park.\nLegionella testing to cold water storage system.”\n2015/16\n“Repairs to sump pump in boiler room.”\n2016/17\n“Replace lock to boiler room.\nAsbestos testing.\nElectrical testing to switch rooms located in basement area. Each switch\nroom supply (sic) electricity to the lifts; door entry systems; lighting to\ncommunal entrances, corridors and terraces; car park lighting; lighting\nto refuse rooms, exit ramps and roads; power to plant rooms, sewage\npumps, risers, CCTV, extractor fans etc. Costs relating to all meters are\naggregated and apportioned based on the number of lights connected to\neach meter.”\n17\n\n2017/18\n“Unblock drain in Portpool Lane. Under this item, Ms Littlechild says as\nfollows “awaiting info from VS, Portpool Lane is nowhere near the\nBrunswick Centre”.\nReplace lock to boiler room.\nRepairs to broken step at entrance to Foundling Court from shopping\ncentre.”\n2018/19\n“No estate repairs recharged.”\n(73) In my determination, with one exception, all the costs referred to in the\nprevious paragraph are costs payable from Mrs Ramsaroop under\nparagraph 9, as costs incurred for the benefit of O’Donnell Court, in\ncommon with other premises near or adjoining it.\n(74) The schedule exhibited to Ms Littlechild’s statement at [A688-A715]\nprovides a breakdown of the costs allocated by Camden to Estate Repairs\nand maintenance. Almost all concern O’Donnell Court. A very small\nnumber refer to the wider Estate, such as the jet washing of a communal\nwaste services pipe from the service road to the NCP car park in in June\n2014 [A689]. However, the evidence indicates that the drainage,\nsewerage, water, heating/hot water, and electrical systems serving the\nEstate are all single communal systems, rather than separate services\nserving each Block. As such, the jet washing of the communal waste\nservices pipe in my judgment is a cost recoverable from Mrs Ramsaroop.\n(75) Similarly, the pavement and steps serving the Estate benefit both\nO’Donnell Court in common with other premises near or adjoining it.\nTherefore, the costs of repairing the broken step and entrance between\nFoundling Court and the shopping centre in June 2017 [A692] are\nproperly recoverable as Estate costs. I note that although Mrs\nRamsaroop objects to paying towards this cost, the cost incurred is\n£213.94, and, once apportioned, her contribution will be negligible.\n(76) The one exception is the cost of unblocking the drain in Portpool Lane,\nwhich appears to have been incorrectly allocated. As Ms Littlechild\nidentifies, Portpool Lane is nowhere near the Brunswick Centre. It is\nlocated about a mile away. The cost incurred, in the sum of £141.58, is\ntherefore not payable by Mrs Ramsaroop. However, given that her\ncontribution will be a matter of pennies it is not proportionate or\nnecessary for me to disallow this single item of expenditure.\n(77) Caretaking (Block costs) – I am not persuaded, on the evidence\nprovided, that the standard of caretaking services has been unreasonable\nor that the costs incurred have been excessive. The photographs\nexhibited to Mrs Ramsaroop’s witness statement are generally poor in\nquality and, from what I can ascertain, do not demonstrate that the\n18\n\nhallway between the lift and her flat is covered in substantial amounts of\nbird droppings, or that there is a problem of mice and cockroach\ninfestation.\n(78) In his witness statement, Mr Shah accepts that weekly sweeping\nbalconies and landings may have temporarily slipped in the early months\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, when Camden was operating a reduced\nservice, with priority given to more serious Health & Safety issues. He\npoints out that sometimes the sheer volume of droppings can cause a\nmess, and that when this occurs it should be reported to the Camden’s\nPest Control team who can take measures such as arranging a specialist\nclean or placing anti-pigeon spikes on ledges. It also appears from\nCamden’s solicitor’s letter to Mrs Ramsaroop dated 7 September 2020\n[A595] that one of her neighbours has been asked by Camden to stop\nfeeding the pigeons.\n(79) I do not doubt Mrs Ramsaroop’s evidence that there is a problem with\npigeon droppings, which would obviously have been exacerbated by her\nneighbour feeding them. I appreciate that this, and seeing mouse\ndroppings, would have been a source of distress for her. Whilst she has\nprovided some photographs of rubbish items left for collection by the\nrubbish chute, I obviously cannot ascertain from the photographs how\nlong these had been present when the photographs were taken.\n(80) However, outside of documents created for the purposes of this\nlitigation, there is no documentary evidence in the hearing bundle of Mrs\nRamsaroop, or other residents, complaining to Camden about these\ncaretaking issues. If this was a long-standing problem, as Mrs\nRamsaroop’s suggests, I would have expected to see evidence of such\ncomplaints. Certainly, there is no evidence before me to suggest that\nCamden has failed to act on complaints made by residents.\n(81) On balance, I see no reason to doubt, and accept as true, Mr Shah’s\nevidence that apart from in the early days of the current pandemic,\nsweeping of the balconies and landings took place weekly. I also accept\nas true his assertion that the caretaker checks the block daily, apart from\nat weekends, and removes rubbish from the communal areas.\n(82) The actual costs demanded by Camden from Mrs Ramsaroop amount to\napproximately £189 per annum, equivalent to about £3.65 per week.\nThat is a very modest amount and I do not agree with her that such costs\nare excessive, or that the level of service provided does not justify the\ncosts incurred. I determine that the costs in question are payable by her\nfor each of the service charge years in dispute.\nCalculation and determination of sums payable by Mrs Ramsaroop\nEstimated service charge costs for the service charge years ending 31 March\n2014\n(83) Camden’s demand appears at [A441]. The total sum demanded from\nMrs Ramsaroop was £3,053.01 plus a management charge of 10%. From\n19\n\nthat figure needs to be deducted the following costs, no longer being\npursued by Camden:\n(a) Head Landlord’s Estate charges of £843.41; and\n(b) Mobile Security Patrol charges of £41.01.\n(84) The estimated costs for this service charge year, payable by Mrs\nRamsaroop is therefore £2,168.59 plus a 10% management charge,\ntotalling £2,385.45.\nEstimated service charge costs for the service charge years ending 31 March\n2016;\n(85) Camden’s demand appears at [A458].

From\nthat figure needs to be deducted the following costs, no longer being\npursued by Camden:\n(c) Head Landlord’s Estate charges of £482.45; and\n(d) Mobile Security Patrol charges of £0.37\n(98) The actual costs for this service charge year, payable by Mrs Ramsaroop\nis therefore £1,849.77 plus a 10% management charge, totalling\n£2,034.75.\nEstimated service charge costs for the year ending 31 March 2020.\n(99) Camden’s demand appears at [A486]. The total sum demanded from\nMrs Ramsaroop was £2,482.07 plus a management charge of 10%. From\nthat figure needs to be deducted the following costs, no longer being\npursued by Camden:\n(c) Head Landlord’s Estate charges of £498.63; and\n(d) Mobile Security Patrol charges of £2.93.\n(100) The estimated costs for this service charge year, payable by Mrs\nRamsaroop is therefore £1,980.51 plus a 10% management charge,\ntotalling £2,178.56.\nRemaining Matters\n(101) As stated above, I previously directed that after issue of the tribunal’s\ndecision, either party may request that I, sitting as a judge of the County\nCourt, separately determines, Mrs Ramsaroop’s liability to pay ground\nrent, interest and costs and that if no such application is made, those\nissues will be remitted back to the County Court.\n(102) When considering whether to make such an application Camden should\nhave consideration to the fact that at a relatively late stage in these\nproceedings it elected to abandon its claim against Mrs Ramsaroop\nseeking Head Landlord costs amounting to roughly 30% of the service\ncharges sought. That was after a substantial amount of work had been\ncarried out in seeking to justify its entitlement to such costs. As a social\nlandlord it will no doubt also wish to have regard to the question of\nwhether it wishes to pursue a costs order against one of its more elderly\nlong leaseholders.\nName: Amran Vance Date: 19 April 2021\n22\n\nANNEX - RIGHTS OF APPEAL\nAppealing against the above tribunal decision\n1.

The Applicant leaseholders appealed against notices served on them by the\nLondon Borough of Merton (‘Merton’) under section 36(1) of the Building\nAct 1984 (‘section 36 Notices’) (‘the Act’), requiring the leaseholders to\neither pull down and remove, or effect alterations to, works said to be in\ncontravention of Building Regulations in force at the time of the\ncompletion of Vertex Apartments, consisting of a number of flats and\ntownhouses on a new-build development completed in or around March\n2015 (‘the premises’).\n2. The developer of the premises was Mizen Design Build Limited (‘MDB’).\nOn 13 March 2015, the LHA provided a completion certificate to MDB.\n3. The freehold was then held by Mountfield Road Developments LLP, who\nat some point transferred ownership to Mizen Developments Limited\n(‘Mizen’), without rights of first refusal being given to leaseholders. Mizen\nis the current Freeholder. Vertex Apartments RTM Company Ltd has since\nobtained the right to manage the Premises. It is understood that Mizen has\nalso been given a section 36 notice.\n4. The section 36 Notices were given on or around 17 February 2025 (under a\nmonth before the ten-year limitation in section 36(4) expired). They\nrequired each of the leaseholders, as “owners” to either pull down and\nremove, or effect alterations to, the following contraventions. It is\nunderstood that the report referred to is one that was commissioned and\nobtained by the leaseholders themselves and shared with the LHA:\nDrainage and waste disposal\nH1 (1) An adequate system of drainage shall be provided to carry foul\nwater from an appliance within the building to a public sewer.\nThe Guidance would suggest that it should have adequate falls with\nadequate access for cleansing at changes of gradient and direction.\nReport Item 1.4\nThe drainage installation has not been constructed to satisfy the\nrequirement of Building Regulation H1\n2\n\nMeans of Warning and Escape\nB1. The building shall be designed and constructed so that there are\nappropriate provisions for the early warning of fire and appropriate\nmeans of escape to a place of safety outside the building capable of being\nsafely and effectively used at all material times.\nIt is noted that there is provision for disabled people to gain access to the\nbasement but there is no provision for evacuating them from the\nbasement area safely and effectively at all material times.\nB1 The building shall be designed and constructed so that there are\nappropriate provisions for the early warning of fire and appropriate\nmeans of escape in case of fire from the building to a place of safety\noutside the building capable of being safely and effectively used at all\nmaterial times.\nThe entrance doors and frames within the structural openings of the\napartments do not achieve the required FD30S standard to protect the\nhallway stairway from a fire in any one of the apartments.\nInternal fire spread (structure)\nB3 (3) Where reasonably necessary to inhibit the spread of fire within\nthe building, measure shall be taken to an extent appropriate to the size\nand intended use of the building, compromising either or both of the\nfollowing:- Subdivision of the building with fire resistant construction:\nThe service areas and service ducts have not been provided with fire\nresistant separation including the openings into the service ducts\nproviding a minimum of 30 minutes fire resistant separation adequately\nsmoke sealed.\nProtection from falling\nK1 Stairs, ladders, and ramps, shall be designed and installed to be safe\nfor people moving between different levels in or about the building.\nThe Concrete stairway leading to the basement has variation in the\ndimension between consecutive risers and goings and do not provide safe\nmovement between levels for people in and around the building.\nBuilding Regulation 7 Materials and workmanship\nBuilding work shall be carried out-\n(a) With adequate and proper materials which-\n(1) are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used\n(2) Are adequately mixed and prepared, and\n3\n\n(3) Are applied used or fixed so as to adequately perform the functions\nfor which they are designed, and\n(b) Used in a workmanlike manner.\nI consider that the aluminium coping does not comply with this\nrequirement including the jointing of that coping.\n5. By letter dated 12 March 2025, I identified a number of issues, including:\nSave, perhaps, for the doors to the flats in the property (and of course,\nsubject to seeing the leases to establish whose responsibility the stated\nareas are), it would appear to Judge N Carr that the individual\nleaseholders could not meet the definition of 'owner' in section 126 of the\nBuilding Act 1984 (nor indeed could the RTMCo) since the\ncommon/shared areas and structure/exterior would not ordinarily be\ndemised to them (and so they would not be entitled to receive a rack rent\n(or any rent) in respect of them).\n6. The other matters were difficulties brought about by misidentification of\nthe correct Applicants to the appeal (the reference to the RTMCo is to\nVertex Apartments Right To Manage Company (‘VARTM’), in whose name\nthe appeals were brought), which led to a series of correspondence with Mr\nPhilpott in respect of correct identification of the persons with standing to\nbring the appeal in accordance with sections 40 and 126 of the Act, and\nbasic principles of agency.\n7. The parties were invited to provide position statements addressing the\nmatters raised. Merton did not do so. A case management hearing (‘CMH’)\ntook place on 9 April 2025. Merton did not attend.\n8. As part of the CMH bundle, at the Tribunal’s request, the Applicants\nprovided a sample lease (of Flat 23). The following definitions and clauses\nwere relevant to the issue identified by the Tribunal:\n“the Block” means the block of apartments known as 117-\n123 Kingston Road, London SW19 1PB…\n“the Common Parts” means such parts of the Block as are for the\ntime being not comprised or intended in due\ncourse to be comprised in any lease grated or\nto be granted by the Landlord\n“the Demised Premises” means the Apartment TOGETHER WITH the\nappurtenant rights set forth in the Second\nSchedule hereto BUT EXCEPTING AND\nRESERVING and SUBJECT TO the rights set\nforth in the Third Schedule hereto\n“the Apartment” means the apartment numbered 23 on the\nfourth floor of the Block…and edged red on\nthe Floor Plan including for the purpose of\n4\n\nobligation as well as grant those parts\ndescribed in the First Schedule hereto as\nincluded but excluding those parts therein\ndescribed as excluded\nTHE FIRST SCHEDULE\nDescription of the Apartment\nThe Apartment INCLUDES:\n(a) The internal plastered coverings and the plasterwork of the walls\nbounding the Apartment and the doors and door frames and window\nframes fitted in such walls (other than the external surfaces of such\nwalls doors frames and window frames) and the glass fitted in such\nwindow frames.\n9. Those parts edged red on the plan are ambiguous as to what is supposed to\nbe demarcated within or outside the demise. Mr Philpott’s position at the\nCMH was simply that it would be “unfair” and “inequitable” for the\nleaseholders to have responsibility for the entrance doors and frames\nwithin the structural openings of the apartments, since they did not build\nthe apartments.\n10. Discussion was had over leaseholders’ potential redress, including under\nthe Building Safety Act 2022, against the developer/landlord, should the\nlessees be found to have the obligation in respect of the flat entrance doors\nand frames.\n11. In directions given after that CMH (‘the Preliminary Issue Directions’),\nJudge N Carr identified that whether the leaseholders fell within the\ndefinition of “owner” to be found in section 126 of the Act should be\ndetermined prior to any more substantive issues in the case.\n12. By the Preliminary Issue Directions, Merton was to provide its statement\nof case first, by 4pm on 24 April 2025.\n13. At 12:24pm on 24 April 2025, Mr Philpott make ‘a cost application’\n(internally dated 17 April 2025) seeking a rule 13 order under the Tribunal\nProcedure (First Tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013 (‘the\nrules’), using form order1. Set out there was an assertion that the\nApplicants had incurred £11,132 in legal fees, £360 in managing agent fees,\nand £6,250 for the fees for VARTM’s directors’ fees (Mrs Gillian Stewart\nand Mr Francois-Xavier Basselot). Mr Philpott asserted that because of its\nfailure to attend at the CMH, Merton should pay all of the Applicants’ fees\nto that date, because:\n“Merton has failed to co-operate with the Tribunal such that the Tribunal\ncannot deal with the proceedings fairly and justly. The manner in which\nMerton has conducted the proceedings is frivolous and vexatious and an\nabuse of the process of the Tribunal”.\n5\n\n14. By email received by the Tribunal at 4:08pm on 24 April 2025, and copied\nto Mr Philpott, Mr McIntosh provided the Respondent’s “Position\nStatement” on the preliminary issue. In that statement of case, Mr\nMcIntosh set out the reasons for failing to attend at the CMH, as follows:\n1. Apologies to the Tribunal for not attending the Case Management\nHearing on 9th April 2025 or complying with the request to serve a\nPosition Statement made in a letter dated 12th March 2025.\n2. Firstly, dealing with the letter of 12th March 2025, this was not\nreceived by the Respondent. The first the Respondent became aware\nof such a letter was in a letter dated 17th March 2025 that the\nRepresentative of the Applicant had sent to the Tribunal. The letter of\n12th March 2025 and the Respondent, erroneously as it transpires,\nassumed that that letter was sent to the Applicants only.\n3. Secondly, the Respondent did not receive any formal notification from\nthe Tribunal advising the Respondent of a Case Management Hearing\non 9th April 2025.\n4. Thirdly, and as stated in paragraph J of the Preliminary Issue\nDirections issued by Judge Carr on 9th April 2025: “On making\nenquiries with Mr Philpott, who attended for the leaseholders, he was\nable to show me email correspondence that demonstrated that Mr\nMcIntosh had acknowledged both bundles provided for use at the\nCMH by Mr Philpott.” The Respondent does not dispute that it\nacknowledged the Bundle. The heading of the email set at 17.37 on 4th\nApril 2025 providing a link to the Applicant’s bundle did state:\n“Bundle for CMH 9 April 2025”. As the Respondent had not received\nany communication from the Tribunal, it had, erroneously as it\ntranspires, assumed that that the attendance at the CMH was for the\nApplicants only.\n15. Mr McIntosh further set out Merton’s position. That culminated in the\nfollowing paragraphs:\n13. As to the Applicant’s Position Statement, the following observations\nare made:\n• Paragraph 16 – The Respondent has never asserted that the\nLeaseholders are owners of the common parts. It is accepted that\nthey are not….\n14. Simply put, the Respondent fully accepts that the Applicants have no\npowers to effect repairs to the common parts. There is, however, a\ndebatable issue as to whether the contravention of B1 applies to the\nLeaseholders, i.e. the entrance doors and frames within the\nstructural openings of the apartments do not achieve the required\nFD30S standard to protect the hallway stairway from a fire in any\none of the apartments.\n6\n\n15. This is very much dependent upon the terms of the respective Leases\nof the Applicants and what responsibilities they have in relation to\nthe entrance doors to their respective properties.\n16. Four days later, on 28 April 2025, Merton withdrew the section 36 Notices\nagainst the leaseholders.\n17. By email of 2 May 2025 sent to the Tribunal and Mr Philpott, Mr\nMcIntosh denied that Merton should be liable for rule 13 costs, largely\nreiterating paragraphs L(2)-(4) above, as follows:\nI make the following observations regarding you claim for costs\nregarding this case for the Tribunal to consider\n1. It is not considered that the respondent be ordered to pay the full costs\nor, indeed, any costs.\n2. The reasons being:\n(a) The letter of 12th March 2025 was not received by the Respondent.\nThe first the Respondent became aware of such a letter was in a letter\ndated 17th March 2025 that the Representative of the Applicant had\nsent to the Tribunal. The Respondent, mistakenly in hindsight,\nassumed that that letter of 12th March 2025 was sent to the\nApplicants only as from the nature of the response from the\nApplicant, they were replying to specific questions being asked of\nthem.\n(b) Further, the Respondent did not receive any formal notification from\nthe Tribunal advising the Respondent of a Case Management\nHearing on 9th April 2025.\n(c) Also, as stated in paragraph J of the Preliminary Issue Directions\nissued by Judge Carr on 9th April 2025: “On making enquiries with\nMr Philpott, who attended for the leaseholders, he was able to show\nme email correspondence that demonstrated that Mr McIntosh had\nacknowledged both bundles provided for use at the CMH by Mr\nPhilpott.”. The Respondent does not dispute that it acknowledged the\nBundle. The heading of the email set at 17.37 on 4th April 2025\nproviding a link to the Applicant’s bundle did state: “Bundle for CMH\n9 April 2025”. As the Respondent had not received any\ncommunication from the Tribunal, it had again, mistakenly in\nhindsight, assumed that that the attendance at the CMH was for the\nApplicants only.\n18. By email at 12.19pm on 14 May 2025, sixteen days after the section 36\nNotices were withdrawn, Mr Philpott filed a six page Reply to Merton’s\n24 April 2025 statement of case. Inter alia, that statement alleges a\nnumber of things that it is appropriate to deal with at this point:\n7\n\n- Merton’s statement was unsigned, and it was not clear the statement\nwas from Mr McIntosh: since the statement came from Mr McIntosh\ndirectly, it is unclear what point is being taken.\n- It was sent by an email dated 25 April 2025 at 8:14am: the Tribunal’s\nrecords show that this is not correct, as referred to above.\n- Merton did not reply to a (draft) costs application sent (only) to it by\nMr Philpott on 17 April 2025, and that may be the only reason that\nMerton’s statement was made: This submission is not understood.\nThe Preliminary Issue Directions provided for Merton to send its\nstatement of case by 4pm on 24 April 2025. Correlation is not\ncausation.\n- The email on which the Tribunal’s letter of 12 March 2025 was sent to\nMr Philpott was also copied to Mr McIntosh. Mr Philpott accepts that\nmaybe the email ended up in a spam folder, but says it was for Mr\nMcIntosh to be vigilant. Mr Philpott submits that it was in any event\nunreasonable for Mr Mcintosh to believe that a CMH would be held\nwith only one party, and Mr McIntosh ought to have sought\nclarification from Mr Philpott or the Tribunal. These points will be\ndealt with below.\n- A further 2.5 pages are spent on the Respondent’s statement of case.\nIn particular, Mr Philpott says this\n13. … Merton has discretion whether to recover its expenses for works in\ndefault, and that such discretion would apply to whom Merton decides\nto charge. This seems to go to the heart of the matter. The modus\noperandi of Merton is to give notices to the freeholder and the lessees\ninitially and use its largesse as discretion to not enforce against the\nlessees as it sees fit.\n“If such is the case, then the Respondent could seek to recover from the\nfreeholder only if it considers that they bear full responsibility for the\nworks. The Respondent has made clear that it will not enforce against the\nLeaseholders.”\nThis is unreasonable, frivolous and vexatious. Merton has no basis to\ncharge the lessees with enforcement following the section 36 notices as\nthere is no ownership and no control over the works. It was never a\nquestion of discretion of enforcement as liability did not exist. All that\nMerton has done with this lazy modus operandi is to create worry for the\nlessees and unnecessary appeal costs, and implied to the freeholder that\nthe lessees will pay for the section 36 latent defects to the common areas\nif the freeholder did not do so.\n14. The confusion is further compounded at paragraph 13 of the\nStatement. Paragraph 13 says:\n‘The Respondent has never asserted that the Leaseholders are owners of\nthe common parts. It is accepted that they are not.’\n8\n\nMerton has asserted that the lessees are owners of the common parts by\nits very actions. By issuing section 36 notices to the lessees, which can\nonly be issued against an owner, Merton have said that the lessees are\nowners. This statement is therefore contradictory. Further, the\nacceptance has no context. Is it Merton’s position now, or when the\nsection 36 notices were issued?\n15. Paragraph 14 of the Statement accepts that the lessees have no\npowers to effect repairs to the common parts. It does not accept that the\nsection 36 notices should not have been issued. Indeed, it seems to imply\nthat the section 36 notices apply to the entrance doors of the flats and the\nframes.\n16. So therefore in summary of Merton’s position, the section 36 notices\nto the lessees will not be enforced by Merton, do not apply to the common\nparts, still stand according to the Statement as they are not explicitly\nwithdrawn, and may apply to the entrance doors and frames,\ndepending on the lease. This is a confused position. Further, there is no\nacceptance of unreasonable behaviour or liability for the lessees’ appeal\ncosts.\n17. To add to the confusion, in a letter dated 28 April 2025 and after the\nStatement had been issued, Merton wrote to Mr Francois-Xavier\nBassecot [sic] of flat 16 referring to the section 40 BA appeal, saying the\nMerton withdraws the section 36 notices. Please see Exhibit 1 to the\nReply. It says:\n“You are advised that the Council have decided to withdraw the notice\nserved on each of the leaseholders of the estate. The notice to the\nfreeholder remains in place.”\nThis withdrawal is appreciated. However, there is no reason given for\nthe withdrawal, no apology for Merton’s conduct or compensation for\nthe section 40 appeal costs. To-date I understand that Ms Gillian\nStewart has also received the letter, but am unaware of any other lessees\nreceiving it, and this needs to be confirmed by the managing agent Red\nRock. The appeal must remain until all of the Applicants have confirmed\nreceipt. Further, I am unaware of any notification given to the FTT by\nMerton. The application for costs remains with the FTT.\nThis argument will be dealt with below.\n19. Mr Philpott states at the end of the Reply that he will make a further\napplication for costs. A further rule 13 costs application was in fact made\non the same day by form order1, in the further sum of £2,254.00 for legal\nfees and £1,250.00 for the VARTM directors’ fees, on the basis that\nMerton had “failed to make a reasoned case in its statement of case”.\n20. In the week of 14 May 2025, I was preparing with a view to making a\ndecision in this case the following week. In light of the above, and in\nparticular the letter exhibited by Mr Philpott, I notified that the Tribunal\nhad no remaining jurisdiction to make any order on the appeal if the\n9\n\nnotices had been withdrawn. I invited the Applicants to withdraw the\nappeal, and stated that any rule 13 directions (if the application was\npursued) would be given separately.\n21. The appeal was withdrawn with the Tribunal’s consent. It should be noted\nthat, due to the fact that the First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber) Fees\nOrder 2013 has not been amended since 25 July 2016, this is one of a large\nnumber of jurisdictions subsequently conferred on the Tribunal in which\nthere is no application fee, and so rule 13(2) is inapplicable.\n22. Rule 13 costs directions were given on 2 June 2025. By those directions\nthe Applicants were required to set out their full statement of case on\nrespect of the costs, including:\nwhy it was said that the Respondent has acted unreasonably in\nbringing, defending or conducting proceedings and why this behaviour\nis sufficient to invoke the rule, dealing with the issues identified in the\nUpper Tribunal decision in Willow Court Management Company (1985)\nLtd v Mrs Ratna Alexander [2016] UKUT (LC), with particular reference\nto the three stages that the Tribunal will need to go through, before\nmaking an order under rule 13...\n23. Full details of the costs sought, including a schedule and supporting\ninvoices, were required. Provision was made for a response from Merton\nby 7 July 2025, and an optional reply from the Applicants by 14 July 2025.\n24. By email of 21 July 2025 the Tribunal received the Applicant’s 82-page\nbundle for the rule 13 costs application. The bundle, and separately the\ncovering email, contained a further form order1 seeking rule 13 costs,\nitself dated 15 July 2025. In that application, Mr Philpott seeks a further\n£5,635 in legal fees and £848.35 in VARTM directors’ costs, on the basis\nthat:\n“Merton has failed to amicably settle or make a reasoned response to the\nApplicants’ costs statement of case… The manner in which Merton has\nconducted the proceedings is frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the\nprocess of the Tribunal.”\n25. The Tribunal contacted Mr Philpott several times to “confirm that any\nresponse from Merton is in the bundle (regardless of whether\nit is the Applicant’s case that it was in time or not, and\nregardless of whether it met the formal requirements of the\ndirections) please? If there was no response, he needs to\nconfirm that explicitly.” A response was said to have been sent to the\nprevious case officer’s email address on 22 July 2025, but despite\nrequests to do so that email was not forwarded to/received by the new\ncase officer. Finally, by email of 6 August 2025, Mr Philpott stated:\n“I have received automated acknowledgements to my emails to Merton\nwhich you should now have. These are not in the bundle and I apologise\nif they should have been. Merton received my emails with the bundle for\nagreement plus the third cost application but did not respond save for\n10\n\nthese automated acknowledgements. I do not have a detailed response\nfrom Merton to the statement of case to add to the bundle.”\n26. The above responses from Merton, in particular regarding the failure to\nattend at the CMH incorporated into its statement of case on 24 April\n2025, and its email of 2 May 2025, were not included in the bundle. It was\nonly in the course of preparing this decision, in particular the relevant\nbackground above derived from the papers on the Tribunal’s file and not\nin the costs bundle, that I appreciated that Merton made a response (at\nleast to the first costs application) not once but twice, both on 24 April\n2025 in its Position Statement and subsequently on 2 May 2025 by email.\nMr Philpott took the opportunity to address those matters in the optional\nreply of 14 May 2025. It would neither be fair nor just to omit to have\nregard to them.\n27. To the extent that is required by Mr Philpott’s ‘application’ to debar the\nRespondent from further participation in this application, asserted in the\n“Applicants’ note to the bundle” on the page before the Index, it is made\nneither by the required form order1 nor properly notified to the\nRespondent with sufficient time to reply. The Tribunal in any event\nrefuses to bar the Respondent. The Applicants are not prejudiced by the\ninclusion of Mr McIntosh’s submissions above, which they have in fact\nresponded to, and on which the Tribunal can make findings. The\nRespondent would be prejudiced because it is clear that those\nsubmissions were in direct response to the first rule 13 application, and\nin response to an email from a case officer on 24 April 2025 asking for the\nRespondent’s comments on that application by 4pm on 8 May 2025.\n28. The total claim for rule 13 costs is in fact misstated in paragraph 1 of the\nApplicants’ statement of case, because of the third application. Tallying\ntogether the sums in the three applications, the Applicants seek:\nLegal costs £19,021.00\nManaging Agents Fees £360\nVARTM directors’ fees £8,348.35\nTotal: £27,729.35\nLaw\n29. Rule 13 sets out, so far as relevant, as follows:\n13 Orders for costs, reimbursement of fees and interest on costs\n(1) … the Tribunal may make an order in respect of costs only –\n… (b) if a person has acted unreasonably in bringing, defending or\nconducting proceedings…\n30. The now well-trodden test in Willow Court Management Co (1985)\nLimited v Alexander [2016] UKUT 290 (LC) sets out as follows:\n11\n\n28. At the first stage the question is whether a person has acted\nunreasonably. A decision that the conduct of a party has been\nunreasonable does not involve an exercise of discretion but rather the\napplication of an objective standard of conduct to the facts of the case. If\nthere is no reasonable explanation for the conduct complained of, the\nbehaviour will properly be adjudged unreasonable, and the threshold\nfor the making of an order will have been crossed. A discretionary power\nis then engaged and the decision maker moves to a second stage of the\ninquiry. At that stage it is essential for the tribunal to consider whether,\nin light of the unreasonable conduct it has found to be demonstrated, it\nought to make an order for costs or not; it is only if it decides that it\nshould make an order that a third stage is reached when the question is\nwhat the terms of the order should be.\n31. In Ridehalgh v Horsefield & Anr [1994] Ch 205 (CA) (itself dealing with\nwasted costs), at paras E-G 232 it was said that the question of whether\nconduct is unreasonable turns on whether it permits of a reasonable\nexplanation:\n“Unreasonable” also means what it has been understood to mean in this\ncontext for at least half a century. The expression aptly describes\nconduct which is vexatious, designed to harass the other side rather than\nadvance the resolution of the case, and it makes no difference that the\nconduct is the product of excessive zeal and not improper motive. But\nconduct cannot be described as unreasonable simply because it leads in\nthe event to an unsuccessful result or because other more cautious legal\nrepresentatives would have acted differently. The acid test is whether\nthe conduct permits of a reasonable explanation. If so, the course\nadopted may be regarded as optimistic and as reflecting on a\npractitioner's judgment, but it is not unreasonable.\n32. In Lea & Ors v GP Ilfracombe Management Company Limited [2024]\nEWCA Civ 1241, it was noted that for conduct to be unreasonable it did\nnot have to also be vexatious or designed to harass (¶9 and 10), though it\ncould include such conduct. They are but ways in which unreasonable\nconduct can be described or established, and the terms are not to be\nelided. The Tribunal’s discretion, as read together with section 29\nTribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, is wider than that:\n11. To that extent, therefore, the UT in Assethold Limited v Lessees of\nFlats 1-14 Corben Mews [2023] UKUT 71 (LC); [2023] L.&T.R.12, at [62],\nwas wrong to suggest that an order for costs under rule 13(1)(b) will only\nbe made where the paying party’s behaviour has been vexatious, and\ndesigned to harass the other party rather than to advance the resolution\nof the case. Moreover, although any citation of Ridehalgh in this context\nmust bear in mind that there are three overlapping requirements to be\nmet for a wasted costs order, of which unreasonable conduct is only one,\nthat makes no material difference to the applicable test for unreasonable\nconduct, which is that articulated by Sir Thomas Bingham MR.\n12. The Ridehalgh approach was expressly approved and applied in\nDammerman v Lanyon Bowdler LLP [2017] EWCA Civ 269; [2017] CP\n12\n\nREP 25, at [30]-[31], which was concerned with the similar jurisdiction\nunder CPR 27.14(2)(g) to award costs in small claims litigation where\nthere had been unreasonable conduct. The Court of Appeal confirmed at\n[30] and [31] that the test to be applied when considering unreasonable\nconduct in the context of small claims was that set out in Ridehalgh.\n13. Ridehalgh and Willow Court emphasise the fact-specific nature of the\ntest for unreasonable conduct. It is therefore not appropriate for this\ncourt to give more general guidance as to what does or does not\nconstitute unreasonable behaviour, a point also made in Dammerman.\nThat is also consistent with the policy that the courts should avoid going\nbeyond the CPR to identify rules, default positions, presumptions,\nstarting points and the like, when addressing costs disputes: see\nExcelsior Commercial & Industrial Holdings Ltd v Salisbury [2002]\nEWCA Civ 879 at [32] and Thakkar v Mican [2024] EWCA Civ 552 at\n[20].\n…\n15. Subject to what I have said above, sufficient guidance in respect of\nrule 13(1)(b) is set out in Ridehalgh and Willow Court. A good practical\nrule is for the tribunal to ask: would a reasonable person acting\nreasonably have acted in this way? Is there a reasonable explanation for\nthe conduct in issue?\nDecision and Reasons\nStage one “Unreasonable” conduct, capable of “reasonable explanation\n33. The Applicants rely on the following submissions:\n(a) The first application is predicated on Merton having acted\nunreasonably in defending the case as there was no case to answer\n(by which the Tribunal assumes that Mr Philpott means that the\nRespondent had no prospect of success);\n(b) VARTM never received a satisfactory explanation for the basis on\nwhich the section 36 Notices were given, which Mr Philpott says is\na breach of natural justice.\n(c) Mr Philpott reproduces emails he sent to Mr McIntosh on 6\nFebruary 2025 and 11 February 2025, and asserts an email was\nsent by VARTM on 24 February 2025, in all of which Mr Philpott\nasserts to Mr McIntosh that there “is no legal basis to issue a\nsection 36 notice to a leaseholder” and requiring Merton to justify\nits stance.\n(d) Mr Philpott then makes submission about three points in a letter\nsent to VARTM by Mr McIntosh on 8 May 2025, after the section\n36 notices had been withdrawn. He relies on the responses, as he\nsays that they establish that the serving of the section 36 Notices\nwas unreasonable. VARTM has raised a stage 2 complaint to\nMerton in consequence.\n13\n\n(e) Mr Philpott relies on his position statement provided for the CMH,\nin which he asserted that it would be “inequitable” for the lessees\nto be seen as owners in the common parts, and asserts that Merton\nacted unreasonably by failing to provide a position statement for\nthe CMH as directed so that “[t]he lessees … prepared the bundle\nof documents for the CMC… not being able to fully understand the\ncase against the lessees”.\n(f) Mr Philpott relies on my identification of the preliminary issue in\nthe Preliminary Issue Direction preambles, and maintains that\nMerton should have cancelled the section 36 Notices on 10 April\n2025 when Mr Philpott emailed Mr McIntosh requiring him to do\nso.\n(g) Mr Philpott refers to Merton’s Position Statement of 24 April 2025\nin which it gave its reasons for failing to attend at the CMH or\nprovide a position statement, but does not include them in the\nbundle or exhibit them in the costs bundle or repeat the responses\nmade earlier as set out above.\n(h) Mr Philpott asserts that Merton’s case as set out in that Position\nStatement is confused, and fails to make a reasoned case.\n(i) Mr Philpott asserts that on 28 April 2025 Merton withdrew the\nsection 36 Notices as confirmed in the letter to Mr Basselot, but\ndid not apologise, offer compensation, or notify the Tribunal.\n(j) The second application is further costs incurred in drafting the\nReply to Merton’s Position Statement (received by the Tribunal on\n14 May 2025). Mr Philpott asserts that as Mr McIntosh did not\n“immediately inform” Mr Philpott the extent of the withdrawal of\nthe section 36 Notices, he was forced to draft the Reply, incurring\nunnecessary fees.\n(k) Mr Philpott relies, for the third application, on Merton’s failure to\nengage in settlement negotiations in respect of the rule 13 costs\nsought.\n34. In answer to the first question to be addressed as identified in Willow\nCourt, Mr Philpott relies on the following grounds (though they are said\nnot to be exhaustive):\ni. Issuing a section 36 Notice without giving a legal basis;\nii. Not advising lessees competently of the appeals process;\niii. Failing to attend the CMH;\niv. Asserting the section 36 Notice was justified but that it\nwould not enforce against the lessees;\nv. Not checking the leases;\n14\n\nvi. Withdrawing the section 36 Notices at a late stage\nwithout consultation;\nvii. Not communicating to settle the costs applications; and\nviii. Continuing to justify its actions in its complaints\nprocedure.\nDecision\n35. The threshold for rule 13 costs is high; the conduct complained of must\nbear of no reasonable explanation from an objective point of view. As\nstated in Lea, context is everything in a rule 13 application, which is why\nthe background above is important. It is within that context that the\nTribunal must consider the Applicants’ submissions.\n36. It is also specifically unreasonableness of the defence or conduct of the\nproceedings with which the Tribunal’s discretion is concerned in this case.\n(i) ‘Defence’ objectively unreasonable?\n37. Dealing firstly with the ‘defence’ – in this case the document labelled\nPosition Statement received from the Respondent on 24 April 2025, I find\nthat objectively analysed, the Respondent’s asserted position is not\nwithout foundation or unmeritorious.\n38. As the Tribunal identified, both in its first letter dated 12 March 2025, and\nsubsequently orally at the CMH on 9 April 2025, the lease makes\nprovision about the apartment doors. Objectively, and being careful not\nto resolve the issue which is no longer before me and on which other\ndisputes may turn, the lease provisions are at least capable of being read\nas demising the doors and frames to the leaseholders. Merton had a\nrealistic prospect of that issue being resolved in its favour. That was\nsomething I raised with Mr Philpott at the CMH specifically, which led to\nthe further discussion surrounding leaseholders’ remedies, were I so to\nfind.\n39. This was not a case in which the issue was so clear that the section 36\nNotices were therefore fundamentally ill-founded, although Mr Philpott\nhas throughout the correspondence and proceedings demonstrably\napproached the point as if that is an established fact. Regardless,\ntherefore, of the view Mr Philpott has clearly taken of the remainder of\nthe Position Statement (and in reality, there are good points and bad\npoints on both parties’ sides, as is the norm in al but the rarest disputes),\nthere was merit to the contents of it.\n40. Nor does the Tribunal consider that the Position Statement is as\n‘confused’ or ‘contradictory’ as Mr Philpott asserts in the Reply on 14 May\n2025. Though it could have been worded better (and it is important to\nnote that Mr McIntosh is not a lawyer, unlike Mr Philpott), it is clear that\nMerton does not accept Mr Philpott’s forcefully put criticism that the\nsection 36 Notice had no legal foundation. There was sufficient evidence\nto legitimately argue the point (whether, ultimately, the Tribunal had\n15\n\nresolved the preliminary issue one way or the other – and of course as\nMerton has withdrawn the section 36 Notices, the Tribunal has not done\nso).\n41. Mr Philpott’s position simply fails to recognise the vulnerability in his\nown clients’ case in respect of the doors and frames. While Mr Philpott\nmight have decided to adopt a hyperbolic litigation strategy in an effort to\nobtain settlement, it was for the Applicants in the appeal to demonstrate\nthat the section 36 Notices should be set aside. It appears that the\nApplicants’ conduct of this case was driven by its litigation strategy rather\nthan the objective reality – i.e. that the Applicants had to demonstrate\nthat none of the matters in the section 36 Notices were leaseholder\nobligations, which required them to successfully argue that their leases\ncould be so construed as not to demise the doors and frames to each of\nthem.\n42. Dealing briefly with i. and ii. in paragraph 36 above, these were not\nmatters with which the Tribunal was dealing in the preliminary issue. If\nthey are assertions as to the validity of the section 36 Notices, linked to\nthe appeal application box 15 ground (b), the issue had not yet arisen and\nit would not be appropriate to, in effect, determine that the section 36\nNotices were invalid when this question was not before the Tribunal (it\nbeing one that was to be resolved after resolution of the preliminary\nissue).\n43. As to iv., for the reasons above, it is inappropriate to look at that\nparagraph of the Respondent’s Position Statement in isolation from the\ndoors and frames issue. While there might have been mistaken or indeed\nbad points in the Position Statement, that does not mean that the\nRespondent’s position as a whole was unmeritorious or vexatious.\n44. In those circumstances, I find that the Position Statement – and decision\nto defend the application more generally – was objectively reasonable and\nnot, as Mr Philpott asserts, vexatious or an abuse of the Tribunal’s\nprocess.\n(ii) ‘Conduct’ objectively unreasonable?\nFirst application\n45. Dealing first rule 13 application, based on the failure by Merton to attend\nat the CMH, Mr Philpott asserts by the first costs application that failure\nto attend meant that “the Tribunal cannot deal with the proceedings\nfairly and justly. The manner in which Merton has conducted the\nproceedings is frivolous and vexatious.” In the rule 13 statement of case,\nMr Philpott expands that submission to add that “[t]he lessees …\nprepared the bundle of documents for the CMC… not being able to fully\nunderstand the case against the lessees”.\n46. Mr McIntosh apologised for his non-attendance and provided an\nexplanation for it. He describes the continuing source of his\nmisunderstanding being that the Tribunal did not contact him directly.\n16\n\n47. The Tribunal’s folder shows that an email dated 12 March 2025 timed at\n3.15pm forwarded the 12 March 2025 letter to both Mr Philpott and Mr\nMcIntosh. It is that same letter than contains the directions for the\nparties’ Position Statements, and lists the CMH. There was therefore no\nsubsequent notice of the CMH given.\n48. Sending is not, however, proof of receipt, and receipt is not proof of\ncomprehension. Mr Philpott accepts that it is possible that the Tribunal’s\nemail did not get to Mr McIntosh. Mr McIntosh accepts Mr Philpott sent\nit to him subsequently.\n49. Mr McIntosh gave his explanation of the circumstances in which he drew\nthe conclusion that the CMH was not for both parties, but for the\nApplicants only, as set out in the “Background” above. When he read the\ncopy of the 12 March 2025 letter provided by Mr Philpott, he assumed\nthat the directions in it applied only to the Applicants given the nature of\nthe queries in it (the issues around correct Applicants etc). That\nmisunderstanding was carried through to the email that Mr Philpott sent\nwith the Bundle for the CMH, as Mr McIntosh had not received any\nformal notification of the CMH from the Tribunal.\n50. Mr Philpott suggests it was nevertheless for Mr McIntosh to “be vigilant”\nand seek advice from either Mr Philpott or the Tribunal.\n51. As to seeking advice from Mr Philpott, in the position as representative of\nMerton’s opponent, one might understand why Mr McIntosh did not do\nso in the context of Mr Philpott’s correspondence with Merton generally\n(which would not indicate a flexible or conciliatory approach). The\npotential conflict arising from any such approach is only underscored by\nthe fact that in his email of 10 April 2025 to Mr McIntosh, Mr Philpott\nrepresents my view at the CMH was “the lessees do not have liability for\nremediation work to the common parts under the section 36 notices, as\nthey do not have ownership”, but did not also highlight the lease\nconstruction issue in respect of the doors and frames.\n52. It should be noted that the Tribunal, while it sometimes walks the ringside\nto ensure fairness, flexibility and parity of arms in pursuit of the\noverriding objective, cannot enter the that arena to give advice to parties.\nNevertheless, in this case simple clarification of the requirement of\nMerton’s attendance could have been given on enquiry. Naturally\nhowever, a precondition of seeking ‘advice’ is an understanding that one\nneeds it. I accept that due to his misunderstanding, Mr McIntosh did not\nknow what he did not know.\n53. Although Mr McIntosh’s explanation is based in misunderstanding and\nlack of comprehension of the Tribunal’s practices – and indeed, had Mr\nMcIntosh read the 12 March 2025 letter with an understanding of those\nprocesses, he might have comprehended that the letter was a reflection of\nthe Tribunal’s ambition to agree the next steps in the litigation with both\nparties at a CMH – poor comprehension is not, without more,\nunreasonable conduct. Parties – particularly lay parties, and again it must\nbe borne in mind Mr McIntosh is not a lawyer – often misunderstand the\n17\n\nTribunal’s process. If every non-attendance due to misunderstanding was\nunreasonable conduct, the threshold for rule 13 costs would be\nsignificantly eroded.\n54. I reject the contention that Merton’s failure to attend caused any difficulty\nto the Tribunal. At the CMH, the Tribunal did as it had been intending to\ndo – decided whether the ownership issue should be taken as a\npreliminary issue, and directed both parties’ evidence/submissions on the\nquestion in order to make a determination.\n55. I also reject the contention that the Applicants’ preparation of the bundle\nfor the hearing was affected by the Respondent’s failure to file a Position\nStatement as ‘they did not know what case to answer’. Mr Philpott puts\nthe parties in the wrong positions in that regard – it was the Applicants’\ncase to prove. No case had yet been set out by the Applicants, beyond their\ninitial appeal. Nor did my directions mandate Merton to provide a\nPosition Statement, precisely because the Applicant had yet to set out its\nfull case. The provision was: “The parties are invited to exchange position\nstatements on the above matters no later than 7 days in advance of the\nCMH.”\n56. In light of the documents provided by the Applicant at the CMH (per my\ndirections, including a sample lease), I was able to deem the Applicants’\nappeal application and those documents together be the Applicants’ case\non the preliminary issue. That in fact curtailed the timetable and avoided\nthe need for the Applicant to do more work before the Respondent’s\nresponse. It laid the foundations for the case the Respondent had to\nanswer. Preparation of the Bundle, with the Applicants’ documents\n(only), was in fact the benefit of the Applicants and not a wasted step or\none in which the Applicants were disadvantaged.\n57. Most importantly, the CMH was listed for a CMH, not for consideration\nof strike out/debarring or full hearing of the preliminary issue. The\nTribunal would not have been in a position on that day to make any\ndecision on either matter.\n58. In those circumstances, I reject the Applicants’ contention that the\nRespondent’s failure to attend at the CMH was unreasonable behaviour\nmeeting the Willow Court test, and refuse the first rule 13 costs\napplication.\nSecond application\n59. The second costs application is made on the basis both on the\n‘unreasonable defence’ basis, already dealt with above, and on the basis\nthat because Mr McIntosh did not contact Mr Philpott directly, or inform\nthe Tribunal that the section 36 Notices had been withdrawn on 28 April\n2025, Mr Philpott had to provide the Reply and incurred further costs in\ndoing so.\n60. As set out above, the facts are that the section 36 Notices were withdrawn\non 28 April 2025. Mr Basselot, whose withdrawal notice Mr Philpott\n18\n\nprovided with that Reply, was one of the directors at the VARTM\nproviding instructions to Mr Philpott on behalf of the leaseholders. Mr\nPhilpott does not make it clear when he was provided that letter by his\nclient’s representative, but the contents clearly put him on notice that all\nof the section 36 Notices given to leaseholders had been withdrawn, as\nspecifically stated.\n61. If Mr Philpott was not content with the instructions from his clients’\nrepresentatives, the correct party from whom to seek clarification as their\nsolicitor, then he could himself have emailed Mr McIntosh for\nconfirmation. Instead, he embarked on a six page statement of case, again\nin hyperbolic terms, seeking such redress as an apology and\ncompensation from Merton which are outside the bounds of the\nTribunal’s jurisdiction and not a legitimate reason to maintain the\nproceedings. While that statement of case engages in significant criticism\nof the Respondent’s rationale for giving the section 36 Notices, it\ncontinues to fail to engage with the Applicants’ position as regards the\ndoors and frames in the lease terms.\n62. Most importantly, withdrawal of the section 36 Notices was the outcome\nsought by the appeal, and it is inexplicable that, as a consequence of their\nwithdrawal, the Applicants continued to pursue the appeal. I find the\nreasons as set out in the Reply justifying that approach spurious. The\nReply was not a mandatory step, and Mr Philpott ought to have\nappreciated that the Tribunal had no remaining jurisdiction to affirm,\nvary or quash the notices, since there remained no such notice in force,\nlet alone order an apology or compensation.\n63. Nor is it for Mr Philpott to rely on conduct as if in the position of the\nTribunal. It is for the Tribunal, and the Tribunal only, to suggest to a party\nthat it is being prevented from the fair administration of justice and so\nforth. Mr Philpott’s putting the application as if the Tribunal was in some\nway inconvenienced by Merton failing to tell it the section 36 Notices had\nbeen withdrawn\n64. One might conclude that in this instance, it was Mr Philpott (or, if\ninadequately instructed, his client’s) conduct that left much to be desired.\nNone of the matters relied on were insurmountable problems in the\ncourse of a solicitor’s ordinary conduct of a case.\n65. I find that Mr McIntosh’s conduct, amounting to setting out Merton’s case\nas permitted by the directions, and subsequently taking a view on that\ncase and withdrawing the section 36 Notices, is entirely in accordance\nwith proper litigation conduct and bears of an entirely reasonable\nexplanation in context. That conduct is by no means ‘objectively\nunreasonable’.\n66. I dismiss the second rule 13 costs application.\n19\n\nThird Application\n67. The third application was made to the Tribunal at the same time as the\ncosts bundle was sent to the Tribunal. Merton was not therefore even\ngiven the opportunity to answer it. It relies on Mr McIntosh ‘not engaging\nto settle the costs’ of the Applicants as ‘unreasonable conduct’, and\ntherefore seeks additional sums for the preparation of the costs\nsubmission and bundle (including the witness statement of Mrs Stewart).\n68. I will deal with that matter shortly. Firstly, it was always for the Applicants\nto meet the burden of establishing any conduct of the Respondent met the\nhigh threshold of unreasonable conduct. The Tribunal is generally non-\ncosts shifting (save where indicated otherwise by statute), and there was\nno automatic presumption that costs would follow the event.\n69. It was not incumbent on the Respondent to simply roll over in the face of\nMr Philpott’s multiple applications. Whilst it might have been convenient\nfor the Applicants if Merton had agreed some or all the costs sought,\nMerton not doing so is not ‘unreasonable conduct’. The inconvenience for\nthe Applicants is that, there being no automatic entitlement to costs, the\nrule requires them to establish their case on the rule 13 costs. That is the\nsimple legal position, not brought about by anything Merton did or not do\n(in the context of the findings above).\n70. The Respondent was entitled to leave the matter to the Tribunal to decide.\nI have done so, unhindered by the lack of response from Merton on the\nsecond application, and in circumstances where the Applicants’ own\nconduct has left something to be desired, failing as they did to include in\nthe bundle Merton’s responses to the first rule 13 application, and issuing\nthe third application after the direcitons for responses to the previous\napplications had closed. I have had to rely on previous papers not\nenclosed in the bundle by Mr Philpott, despite my best efforts to cajole\nhim to revisit the bundle (and being unaware at the time I did so the\nextent to which the assertion that the Merton had not responded was\nincorrect).\n71. I dismiss the third rule 13 costs application.\nStages two and three of Willow Court\n72. Since I am not satisfied that the conduct complained of amounts to\n“unreasonable” conduct, these stages do not require findings.\n73. I limit my observations in regard to Willow Court stage two to say that I\nwould not have been satisfied that an order should be made. Had I not\nfound as a fact that failure to attend at the CMH was not unreasonable\nconduct, I would nevertheless have found, for the reasons stated, that\nconduct had no impact on the Applicants.\n74. At stage three, I therefore further limit my observations to state that, in\nany event, the amount of costs claimed by Mr Philpott is unreasonably\nhigh, given that the application was made on 10 April 2025, one CMH\n20\n\noccurred, and the section 36 Notices were withdrawn on 28 April 2025\nbefore any further steps were required by the Applicants. For the reasons\nabove, much of the work incurred by Mr Philpott in the course of the\napplication was through his own basic misunderstandings and an\nexcessive veal.\n75. The schedules provided by Mr Philpott do not identify his grade, though\nhe has included his retainer with VARTM. It is not therefore possible to\nascertain whether the rate he charges at is within the guidelines and\nreasonable.\n76. For example, the first schedule indicates that he spent 10.9 hours of time\nin drafting the appeal to the Tribunal (including corrections and reviews\n(both his own and after feedback from VARTM) etc), billing £2,507.00 (at\na rate of £230 per hour, which appears to be VAT exclusive).\n77. The grounds set out in box 15 of the application occupy less than half a\ntyped page (though it is acknowledged the font is smaller than 12). The\ncovering letter is but two pages (that do not add to the grounds). The list\nof leaseholders that accompanied it is 25 lines long (including headings)\nand presumably prepared by or in collaboration with Red Rock (the\nManaging Agent) or VARTM’s directors. One cannot help but observe that\ntime spent on the document described appears unreasonable.\n78. That disproportionate approach is reflected across all of the schedules\nprovided by Mr Philpott, as borne out by the section dedicated to the\nReply above.\n79. As for the VARTM directors’ costs, I note the contents of Mrs Stewart’s\nwitness statement dated 14 July 2025, presumably intended to be in\nsupport of the further costs requested for her and Mr Basselot’s director\ntime. I do not doubt that the leaseholders have been left in an invidious\nposition by the poor construction practices and conduct of the\ndeveloper/landlord. However, in reflection of Mr Philpot’s own approach,\nthat statement goes far beyond the issues in the preliminary issue, or even\nin the section 36 Notices appeal. The vast array of matters relied on\nobscure the key point that there was a discrete preliminary issue before\nthe Tribunal, and that there was indeed a case to answer on that\npreliminary issue i.e. the leaseholders’ demise in respect of the doors and\nframes.\n80. Nor is any explanation given why the directors should be awarded costs\nin anything other than a litigant in person capacity (and particularly\nbecause each of them is a leaseholder with the right to and interest in\npursuing their own appeal at proportionate cost) when there is an\ninstructed legal representative.\nConclusion\n81. For all of the reasons above, the costs applications are dismissed.\nName: Judge N Carr Date: 14 August 2025\n21\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013, the Tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of\nappeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber),\nthen a written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal\nat the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within\n28 days after the Tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person\nmaking the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with\nthe 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide\nwhether to allow the application for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not\nbeing within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the Tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n22"

The date\nof acquisition will be three months after this determination\nbecomes final (section 90(4) of the 2002 Act.\nSenior President of Tribunals Practice Direction: Reasons for\nDecisions 4 June 2024\n1. This Practice Direction states basic and important principles on the\ngiving of written reasons for decisions in the First-tier Tribunal. It\nis of general application throughout the First-tier Tribunal. It\nrelates to the whole range of substantive and procedural decision-\nmaking in the Tribunal, by both judges and non-legal members.\nAccordingly, it must always be read and applied having regard to\nthe particular nature of the decision in question and the particular\ncircumstances in which that decision is made (paragraph 1).\n2. Where reasons are given, they must always be adequate, clear,\nappropriately concise, and focused upon the principal\ncontroversial issues on which the outcome of the case has turned.\nTo be adequate, the reasons for a judicial decision must explain to\nthe parties why they have won and lost. The reasons must enable\nthe reader to understand why the matter was decided as it was and\nwhat conclusions were reached on the main issues in dispute. They\nmust always enable an appellate body to understand why the\ndecision was reached, so that it is able to assess whether the\ndecision involved the making of an error on a point of law. These\nfundamental principles apply to the tribunals as well as to the\ncourts (paragraph 5).\n3. Providing adequate reasons does not usually require the First-tier\nTribunal to identify all of the evidence relied upon in reaching its\nfindings of fact, to elaborate at length its conclusions on any issue\nof law, or to express every step of its reasoning. The reasons\nprovided for any decision should be proportionate, not only to the\nresources of the Tribunal, but to the significance and complexity of\nthe issues that have to be decided. Reasons need refer only to the\nmain issues and evidence in dispute, and explain how those issues\nessential to the Tribunal’s conclusion have been resolved\n(paragraph 6).\n2\n\n4. Stating reasons at any greater length than is necessary in the\nparticular case is not in the interests of justice. To do so is an\ninefficient use of judicial time, does not assist either the parties or\nan appellate court or tribunal, and is therefore inconsistent with the\noverriding objective. Providing concise reasons is to be encouraged.\nAdequate reasons for a substantive decision may often be short. In\nsome cases a few succinct paragraphs will suffice. For a procedural\ndecision the reasons required will usually be shorter (Paragraph 7).\nApplication\n5. On 20 February 2024 Applicants 1 & 2 applied jointly under section\n84(3) of the 2002 Act for a decision that, on the relevant date,\nApplicant 1 was entitled to acquire the right to manage Walsham\nCourt, Perkins Gardens, Ickenham, Uxbridge UB10 8FZ (Premises\n1) and Applicant 2 was entitled to acquire the right to manage\nHinds Court, Perkins Gardens, Ickenham, Uxbridge UB10 8FQ\n(Premises 2).\n6. On 21 November 2023 Applicant 1 served a claim dated 14\nNovember 2023 giving notice that it intended to acquire the right to\nmanage Premises 1 on 25 March 2024.\n7. On 21 November 2023 Applicant 2 served a claim dated 14\nNovember 2023 giving notice that it intended to acquire the right to\nmanage Premises 2 on 25 March 2024.\n8. On 18 December 2023 Respondent 1 (the Freeholder) served a\nseparate counter notice for each Premises admitting that the\nApplicants were entitled to acquire the right to manage their\nrespective premises.\n9. On 22 December 2023 Respondent 2 (the Manager) served a\nseparate counter notice for each Premises denying that the\nApplicants were entitled to acquire the right to manage their\nrespective premises. The reason given for the denial was the same\nfor both Premises, which was that each Premises was not a self-\ncontained building or part of a building by reason section 72(1) to\n(5) of the 2002 Act but in particular subsections (4) and (5).\n10. On 27 February 2024 Respondent 2’s Property Manager requested\nfurther details of the Applicants’ cases. The Applicants supplied a\ncopy of Counsel’s opinion on whether the buildings were\nstructurally detached for the purposes of section 72 of the 2002 Act.\nIn Counsel’s opinion each Premises was structurally detached,\nnotwithstanding the shared used of the utilities provided by the\nheating system, and that the heating plant itself was located in the\nHinds Building.\n3\n\n11. Around May 2024 Respondent 2’s solicitors contacted the\nApplicant’s representative by telephone indicating that Respondent\n2 would be withdrawing its opposition to the RTM claim in the light\nof Counsel’s opinion.\n12. From May 2024 to March 2025 the Applicants and Respondent 2\nwere in discussions about the Right to Manage and a way forward\nin respect of the shared services. Unfortunately no agreement was\nreached.\n13. On 18 March 2025 the Applicants’ representative contacted the\nTribunal about the Application. The Tribunal advised that the fee\nwhich had been paid on 28 March 2024 had not been reconciled to\nthe account. This was rectified.\n14. On 18 March 2025 the Tribunal directed that the Application\nshould be determined on the papers without an oral hearing unless\na party requested a hearing by 22 April 2025. No such request was\nmade. The Tribunal agreed that the Application by each Applicant\ncould be heard together. The Tribunal stated that the Applications\ntogether with the enclosures would constitute the Applicants’ cases.\nThe Respondents were required to supply their cases by 14 April\n2025, and various rights of reply were given to the parties. The\nTribunal required the Applicants to provide the hearing bundle by 9\nJune 2025. The Tribunal indicated that it would decide the\nApplication during the seven days commencing 23 June 2025 using\nthe document bundle provided.\n15. The Tribunal has considered the documents in the hearing bundle\nwhich was supplied by the required date. Louisa Myatt, the\nApplicants’ representative, provided a detailed witness statement\non behalf of the Applicants dated 9 June 2025. The bundle\nincluded, amongst other matters, photographs of the estate and\nbuildings and the opinion of Counsel.\n16. On 20 March 2025 Respondent 1 (the Freeholder) informed the\nTribunal that it had admitted the Applicants’ rights to manage their\nrespective premises, and that it would be taking no further part in\nthe proceedings.\n17. Respondent 2 did not respond to the Tribunal directions despite\nvarious emails from the Applicants’ representative encouraging it to\neither respond or reach agreement.\nConsideration\n18. The sole issue in this case is whether the respective premises are\nself-contained buildings within the meaning of section 72 of the\n2002 Act.\n19. The Tribunal finds the following facts:\n4\n\n1) Walsham Court is a detached purpose built block of flats\ncomprising 66 self-contained flats. Hinds Courts is a\ndetached purpose built block of flats comprising 39 self-\ncontained flats.\n2) Specimen leases were exhibited for one flat in each block.\nThe Tribunal understands that the leases of the other flats in\nthe two blocks are in the same form. The leases have been\ngranted for a term of 125 years commencing on 1 January\n2016.\n3) Walsham Court and Hinds Court are located on a\ndevelopment which was completed around 2017. The estate\nincludes the two blocks of flats which are the subject of this\napplication, private roads and amenity areas together with\nother flats and some freehold houses.\n4) Walsham Court and Hinds Court share a combined heat and\npower system that serves the two blocks but no other part of\nthe estate. The two blocks have been managed together since\nthey were built, and budgets have included a combined\nservice charge budget for both blocks which apportioned\ncosts between the 105 flats.\n20. Section 72 subsection (2) states that a building is a self-contained\nbuilding if it is structurally detached. Subsections (4) and (5) add\nthe “relevant services test” which only applies if the RTM\napplication refers to a self-contained part of a building. In this\nApplication the Tribunal is dealing with two whole buildings not a\nself-contained part of a building. Thus the Tribunal only has to be\nsatisfied that Walsham Court and Hinds Court are structural\ndetached in order to meet the requirement of self-contained\nbuildings.\n21. The Tribunal has found that Walsham Court and Hinds Court are\ndetached buildings which is supported by the Applicants’ witness\nstatement and photographs. Respondent 2 has not submitted a case\nexplaining why it does not consider that the Premises meet the self-\ncontained building test.\n22. The Applicants have proceeded on the basis that Respondent 2’s\nobjection is related to the shared heating system. Counsel in her\nopinion relied on the Upper Tribunal case in CQN RTM Co Limited\nv Broad Quay North Block Freehold Limited [2018] UK UT 183 for\nthe meaning of “structurally detached”. Counsel referred\nspecifically to paragraph 54 of the decision where HH Judge Hodge\nKC set out a range of propositions on the meaning of structurally\ndetached. Counsel placed emphasis on the propositions: “\n‘Structural’ in this context means ‘appertaining or relating to the\nessential core fabric of the building’ ”, and “a building can be\n5\n\n‘structurally detached’ even if it cannot function independently”.\nCounsel considered that the combined heat and power plant cannot\nbe described as part of or relating to the essential or core fabric of\nthe building. Counsel concluded that in her opinion the Walsham\nCourt and Hinds Court buildings are structurally detached\nnotwithstanding their shared use of utilities provided by the\ncommon heating system located in the Hinds Building. The\nTribunal adopts Counsel’s opinion and agrees that the shared\nheating system has no relevance to the question of whether the\npremises are structurally detached.\n23. The Tribunal decides that Walsham Court and Hinds Court are\nstructurally detached and meet the definition of self-contained\nbuildings. As there are no other objections to the Applicants’ claim\nfor right to manage the Premises, the Tribunal is satisfied that they\nare entitled to acquire the right to manage Walsham Court and\nHinds Court.\n24. The Supreme Court in FirstPort Property Services Ltd v Settlers\nCourt RTM Co Ltd, [2022] 1 W.L.R. 519 established that “where a\nright to manage company took over the management of a block of\nflats which formed part of a larger estate containing other blocks,\nthe Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 Pt 2 Ch.1 did not\nprovide for the RTM company to manage estate facilities shared by\nthe blocks. The RTM company was concerned only with\nmanagement of the relevant premises, namely the relevant building\nor part of a building, together with any appurtenant property,\nwhich meant nearby physical property over which the occupants of\nthe relevant building or part had exclusive rights”.\n25. The Applicants in their witness statement set out a range of\nconcerns with the management of the shared heating system and\nhave sought to strike a separate agreement without success to\nmanage the system on behalf of Respondent 2. The Applicants\naccept that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction regarding the making of\na separate agreement and that the shared heating system remains\nthe responsibility of Respondent 2.\n26. The Tribunal concludes that the scope of the Applicants’ right to\nmanage applies to the buildings of Walsham Court and Hinds Court\nand appurtenant property which exclusively serve each block\nincluding the demised parking spaces. Any areas serving both\nblocks, such as the communal bin store and cycle stores will remain\nunder the management of Respondent 2, along with the shared\naccess road, green space and shared heating system.\n27. The Applicants have requested a new acquisition date of 1 July\n2025 given the efforts that they have made to reach agreement with\nRespondent 2 and the delays already experienced including the fact\nthat the payment of the Tribunal fee for the hearing was not\nallocated to the case until March 2025. Although the Tribunal is\n6\n\nsympathetic to the Applicants’ request, the Tribunal considers that\nit is bound by the wording of section 90(4) of the 2002 Act, namely\nthe acquisition date is the date three months after the\ndetermination becomes final. The Applicants have pointed to no\nauthority which permits the Tribunal to depart from the\nrequirements of section 94(4).\nDecision\n28. The Tribunal determines that Applicant (1) was on the 21\nNovember 2023 entitled to acquire the right to manage\nWalsham Court, Perkins Gardens, Ickenham, Uxbridge\nUB10 8FZ. The date of acquisition will be three months\nafter this determination becomes final (section 90(4) of\nthe 2002 Act.\n29. The Tribunal determines that Applicant (2) was on the 21\nNovember 2023 entitled to acquire the right to manage,\nHinds Court, Perkins Gardens, Ickenham, Uxbridge UB10\n8FQ. The date of acquisition will be three months after\nthis determination becomes final (section 90(4) of the\n2002 Act.\n7\n\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application\nto the First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing\nwith the case.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the\nTribunal sends to the person making the application written reasons for\nthe decision.\n3. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28 day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to\nappeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide\nwhether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to\nappeal to proceed.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state\nthe result the party making the application is seeking.\n8"

Ellis.\nTribunal Member R P Cammidge FRICS.\nDate of Hearing : 3 December 2018\nDate of Decision : 2 January 2019\n__________________________________________________\nDECISION\n__________________________________________________\nCrown Copyright © 2018\n\nThe new rent determined by the Tribunal with effect from 8 October\n2018 is £183.00 per week.\nIntroduction\n1. The Applicant Mrs Christine Thompson has occupied 14 North Gate Harborne\nBirmingham B17 9EP (the Property) since 6 April 1992 pursuant to an\nagreement between the Applicant and Harborne Tenants Limited. At a date\nnot relevant to these proceedings the Respondent BPT(Residential\nInvestments)Limited of First Floor, Citygate, St James Boulevard, Newcastle\nupon Tyne NE1 4JE (the Respondent) acquired the Property but did not issue\na new tenancy agreement to the Applicant. It is not disputed that the Property\nis let to the Applicant on an assured periodic tenancy.\n2. On 6 September 2018 the Respondent served the Applicant with a notice in\nprescribed form proposing a new rent of £190.00per week in place of the\nexisting rent of £175.00per week. The proposed new rent is to take effect from\n8 October 2018.\n3. On 24 September 2018 the Applicant issued these proceedings referring the\nRespondent’s notice to the Tribunal for determination under s14 Housing Act\n1988 (the Act).\n4. On 3 December 2018 the Tribunal inspected the Property and made its\ndetermination. The Respondent has now asked for the Tribunal’s reasons for\nits determination.\nInspection\n5. The Property is a two storey three bedroom terraced house constructed of\nbrick and tile with gardens front and rear. The front entrance door opens onto\na lobby with staircase to upper floor. The ground floor comprises a front\nsitting room with gas fire and radiator. To the rear is a dining room with galley\nkitchen off it. A rear door from the dining room leads outside to the rear\ngarden via a small lobby. A sitting room on the ground floor was converted to\na bathroom before the Applicant took up residence.\n\n6. All carpets and curtains and white goods were supplied by the Applicant.\n7. On the upper floor there is a large front bedroom with a radiator. There is a\nsecond bedroom presently furnished with a single bed but large enough for a\ndouble bed. The third bedroom is small but sufficient for a single bed. A w/c is\nlocated on the upper floor. The gas boiler is in the toilet room.\n8. The windows are single glazed and many of the frames are showing signs of\nrot. The house has been rewired recently but at the tenant’s request\nredecoration has not yet taken place.\n9. Exterior inspection revealed the need for some repair and maintenance work\nincluding roof repairs to ridges and replacing slipped and missing tiles and\nmaintenance to the rainwater goods.\nStatutory Framework\n10. S14 of the Housing Act 1988 provides that the Tribunal shall determine the\nrent at which the Property might reasonably be expected to be let at the\nvaluation date in the open market by a willing landlord under an assured\ntenancy which (in this case) is an assured periodic tenancy on the same terms\n(except as to rent) as those of the subject tenancy, but disregarding (a) any\neffect on the rent attributable to the granting of a tenancy to a sitting tenant;\n(b) any increase in the value of the dwelling house attributable to a relevant\nimprovement carried out by the tenant otherwise than in pursuance of an\nobligation to his immediate landlord; and (c) any reduction in value due to a\nfailure by the tenant to comply with any terms of the tenancy. Under\nsubsection (4) the rent does not include any service charge as defined under\nsection 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.\nSubmissions\n\n11. The Applicant did not present any comparables. Her knowledge of other\nproperties in the area was limited to the occasional social visit to near\nneighbours’ houses.\n12. The Respondent is an experienced landlord well used to the principles of rent\ndetermination. The Respondent asserted the property is in good condition\ngiven its type and age in a sought after location within Harbourne. The\nRespondent asked the Tribunal to take into account Spath Holme Ltd v\nGreater Manchester and Lancashire Rent Assessment Committee QBD\n(Times 13-Jul-94, (1994) 27 HLR 243) and Curtis v London Rent Assessment\nCommittee [1997] EWCA Civ 2453, [1999] QB 92 and one other case when\nmaking its determination.\n13. It then made submissions regarding some comparable properties within the\nsame geographical location and comparable market tenancies available\nthrough local agents. The comparable evidence was two properties both on\nWest Pathway a short distance away. One of the comparables was a mid\nterraced property the other an end terrace property both with three bedrooms.\n14. The mid terrace property was offered at £1200pcm (£276.92pw), the end\nterrace property offered at £1250pcm (£288.46 pw).\n15. The Respondent conceded that there were differences between the\ncomparables and the subject Property in that they had:\na. Modernised kitchen\nb. White goods and appliances\nc. Conservatory\nd. Floor coverings\ne. Feature fireplaces\nf. Modernised first floor bathroom\ng. Loft conversion\nh. General modernisation throughout.\n\n16. The Respondent used a theoretical figure of £10pw for the modernisation of\nthe kitchen, conservatory, modernised first floor bathroom, loft conversion\nand a general modernisation throughout and the theoretical figure of £7 pw\nfor the white goods/appliances, floor coverings and feature fireplaces in order\nto support a contention that the rent proposed of £190.00pw was £15.92pw\ncheaper than the lowest market tenancy within ½ mile of the Property.\nDecision\n17. The Applicant was unable to provide any information regarding rents in the\nnear neighbourhood of the Property. The information given by the\nRespondent was of limited help because the properties referred to were in\nbetter condition and incorporated superior layouts than the subject Property\nby reason of recent improvements. The Respondent conceded as much in its\nsubmission.\n18. The Tribunal identified other properties within ¼ mile of the Property at\nWentworth Gate offered at £995pcm and Highbrow offered at £1000pcm.\n19. Inspection of the Property indicated it was in need of substantial\nmodernisation. It had been rewired within the last two years but the Tribunal\nwas satisfied the rewire was needed as a matter of maintenance rather than\nimprovement.\n20. The Respondent is proposing an increase of £15.00 per week which represents\nan increase of between 8.5 and 9%. Although the Property is in a sought after\narea the Tribunal is not satisfied that a tenant would offer £1200.00pcm as\nasserted by the Respondent. Moreover, the property even if modernised\nsuffers from a poor layout having a ground floor bathroom and also a small\ngalley style kitchen. In the view of the Tribunal these factors would have a\nnegative impact on the rental value of the property.\n\n21. Having regard to the condition and layout of the Property but recognising its\nsituation in a sought after area the Tribunal has determined market rent for\nthe Property is £970.00pcm. From that sum the Tribunal has allowed\nDouble Glazing 45.00\nWhite goods for kitchen 20.00\nKitchen refurbishment 17.00\nBathroom refurbishment 12.50\nRepairs 11.00\nFittings carpets and curtains 35.00\nTotal before liability for decorations 140.50\nAdd 5% existing rent for decorations 38.00\nTotal deductions per month 178.50\n22. The market rent is determined by the Tribunal as £970.00pcm less\n£178.50. That is £791.50pcm or £182.65 rounded to £183.00pw\nwith effect from 8 October 2018.\nAppeal\n23. If either of the parties is dissatisfied with this decision they may apply to this\nTribunal for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\nAny such application must be received within 28 days after these written\nreasons have been sent to them under 9 rule 52 of The Tribunal Procedure\n(First-tier Tribunal)(Property Chamber) Rules 2013.\nTribunal Judge PJ Ellis"

This is an application made by the applicant leaseholder pursuant to\nsection 48 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development\nAct 1993 (“the Act”) for a determination of the premium to be paid for\nthe grant of a newly extended lease of 7 Goodwyn Avenue London\nNW7 3RJ (the “subject property”).\n2. By a notice of a claim served pursuant to section 42 of the Act, the\napplicant exercised the right for the grant of a new lease in respect of\nthe subject property. At the time, the applicant held the existing lease\nof the subject property. The applicant subsequently proposed to pay a\npremium of £25,000 for the new lease.\n3. The respondent freeholder served a counter-notice admitting the\nvalidity of the claim and subsequently counter-proposed a premium of\n£71,750 for the grant of a new lease.\nThe issues\n4. Many aspects of the claim and valuation were agreed by the parties other\nthan the matters listed below. The following matters have been agreed:\n1. Date of valuation 4 January 2022\n2. unexpired term 54.22 years\n3. capitalisation rate for the ground rent income 6%\n4. deferment rate for calculation of the value of landlord’s reversions\n5%\n5. relativity 74.10%\n6. The flat is to be valued as a one-bedroom flat disregarding the\nexistence of the single storey kitchen extension at the rear. The flat\nis valued with the benefit of a rear garden and there is a dispute\nbetween the parties as to whether there is a right to park at the front\nof the property.\nMatter not agreed.\n5. The following matters were not agreed:\n(a) New lease terms and\n2\n\n(b) Premium payable\nThe hearing\n6. The hearing in this matter took place on 10 May 2023. The applicant\nwas represented by their Chartered Surveyor, Mr Eamonn Sonner and\nthe respondent by their Chartered Surveyor, Mr Peter Morgan.\n7. This has been a remote hearing which has been consented to by the\nparties. The form of remote hearing was coded as CVPREMOTE - use\nfor a hearing that is held entirely on the Ministry of Justice Cloud Video\nHearing platform with all participants joining from outside the court. A\nface-to-face hearing was not held because it was not possible due to the\nCovid -19 pandemic restrictions and regulations and because all issues\ncould be determined in a remote hearing. The documents that were\nreferred to are in one bundle of many pages, the contents of which we\nhave recorded, and which were accessible by all the parties. Therefore,\nthe tribunal had before it one electronic/digital trial bundle of\ndocuments prepared by the applicant and by the respondent, in\naccordance with previous directions. Valuation reports from both\nsurveyors were the core element of the bundle.\n8. Neither party asked the tribunal to inspect the subject property and the\ntribunal did not consider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection\nto make its determination.\n9. The applicant confirmed that the only reasons the dispute was before\nthe Tribunal were because the parties could not agree on the basis for\nthe valuation for the consideration to be paid for the newly extended\nlease and the new lease terms.\nMr Sonner’s evidence\n10. Mr Sonner describes the flat is a converted ground floor flat of traditional\nconstruction with a single-story extension to the rear with a felt flat roof.\nThe rear garden is enclosed and on street parking is available with daytime\nrestrictions. Accommodation is agreed as 1 bedroom, reception room,\nkitchen, bathroom and entrance hall. He measures the floor area at 56.77\nm². The rear extension is to be disregarded for valuation purposes.\n11. Mr Sonner adopts the definition of value set out in the international\nvaluation standards taking into account the requirement of the Act and the\nterms of the existing lease. In particular the tenant will not erect any\nbuilding on the garden and will use the garden as a garden only and will\nnot convert the same to any use whatever.\nComparable evidence\n3\n\n12. 49a Goodwyn Avenue is a converted one-bedroom first-floor flat in\naverage condition but with the benefit of off-street parking. The lease has\n143 years unexpired. The property was placed on the market in May 2022\n4 £375,000 with the asking price reduced to £335,000 in October 2022.\nMr Sonner gave evidence that he had spoken to the selling agent within the\npast few days who confirmed that the property was still under offer at\n£320,000 with a mortgage offer received and exchange expected shortly.\nAlthough this is not a completed transaction as it is a flat in the same street\nand currently firmly under offer the tribunal places considerable weight on\nthis transaction.\n13. 2b Langley Park NW7 is a one-bedroom apartment with 92 years\nunexpired on the lease and no car parking or garden. It is on the market at\nan asking price of £350,000. No sales particulars are exhibited, and no\nevidence was given of the length of time it has been on the market. The\ntribunal places little weight on this evidence.\n14. Westmere Drive NW7 is a 1st floor one-bedroom flat with a re-fitted\nkitchen currently on the market at £325,000 with 123 years left unexpired\non the lease. Again no sales particulars are exhibited and with no\nmarketing history the tribunal places little weight on this comparable.\n15. Hammers Lane NW7 is a 1st floor one-bedroom flat currently on the\nmarket at £325,000. There are 123 years left on the lease. Again there are\nno marketing particulars or marketing history and the tribunal places little\nweight on this evidence.\n16. Additionally, several two-bedroom flats are included to illustrate the\ndifference between one and two-bedroom flats.\n17. Flat 2, 5 Millway NW7 is a two-bedroom flat which sold for £420,000 on\n10 June 2022. Property had 111 years remaining on the lease and off-street\nparking. The flat is described as being in excellent condition.\n18. 10 Millway NW7 is a two-bedroom ground floor flat described by the\nselling agents as being immaculately presented. It benefits from off-street\nparking and sold in April 2022 4 £448,000.\n19. Flat 2, 4 Lewy House 1 Langley Park NW7 is a converted 2-bedroom 2-\nbathroom apartment with parking. It is available at an asking price of\n£430,000 and previously sold in November 2018 for £395,000.\n20. 6b Flower Lane NW7 a two-bedroom flat available for sale at an asking\nprice of £400,000 photograph appears to show parking at the front of the\nproperty.\n21. No sales particulars or marketing history of any of these 4 properties has\nbeen provided and as they are two-bedroom flats the tribunal does not find\n4\n\nthem of direct relevance in valuing the subject property. They are of\nlimited benefit as context in the market.\nMr Sonner’s valuation\n22. Mr Sonner places the greatest weight on the proposed sale of 49a Goodwyn\nAvenue at £320,000 being one-bedroom flat of similar style and in the\nsame road. It is in similar condition.\n23. Mr Sonner acknowledges that parking exists in the former front garden,\nbut this is excluded specifically under the terms of the lease in paragraph\n12 of the schedule. In his view therefore parking should be excluded in\naccordance with the terms of the lease. The landlord has other remedies if\nhe chooses to use them, and a prospective hypothetical purchaser would do\nso with the benefit of a mortgage and ambiguities in the lease would be\npointed out. The property would not be sold with the benefit of parking.\nFor these reasons he adjusts the sale evidence of 49a Goodwyn Avenue by\n£20,000 to get to an adjusted value of £300,000. Using the Nationwide\nHouse Price Index, he considers that the value would have increased from\nthe valuation date to the present day by 4.09%. However, he adopts the\nfigure of £300,000 as the vacant possession value.\n24. Mr Sonner considers that the tenant’s improvements of replacement\ndouble glazed windows, new bathroom and heating system with a new\nfitted kitchen should be disregarded, and he assesses the value of these\nimprovements at 5% or £15,000. The starting point for his valuation is\n£285,000 for the long leasehold interest.\n25. In commenting on this valuation Mr Morgan reminded the tribunal that\nthe valuation date was January 2022 which predates the significant rise in\nmortgage interest rates during the latter part of 2022 which has had an\nundoubted effect on the property market since then. This should be taken\ninto account in considering current transactions.\n26. In response to a question from the tribunal, Mr Sonner did not consider\nthat the rear garden added any value as compared with a 1st floor flat.\nMr Morgan’s evidence\n27. Mr Morgan lists the accommodation of the property as a two-bedroom flat\nwith the benefit of sole use of the patio and rear garden. The existence of\nthe garden has enabled the leaseholder to build an extension housing the\nkitchen.\n28. In relation to the rear extension, the statutory formula requires authorised\ntenant’s improvements to be disregarded but he considers that the value of\nthe right to make those improvements should be included. Given that the\nleaseholder has the use of the rear garden and is able to build an extension\n5\n\nthat value needs to be included. The fact the freeholder has given\npermission to build the extension constitutes a variation to the terms of the\nlease which might otherwise have prevented it.\n29. The extension has a floor area of 189 ft.² and valuing this at £800 per\nsquare foot comes to £151,200. The building cost at £200 per square foot\nis about £37,800 and allowing for fees and finance and the margin for time\nand trouble he considers that a total cost of £75,000 would be correct\nleaving about £75,000 for the land value or write to extend.\n30. In considering the question of car parking, Mr Morgan wrongly states that\nthe ground floor lease does not prohibit car parking in the front garden\nunlike the 1st floor flat lease which he exhibits. The tribunal pointed out to\nhim that clause 12 of the schedule prohibits parking. In practice the\nfreeholder of the ground floor flat is parking in the forecourt and the\nfreeholder has never made any attempt to prevent him from doing so.\nComparable evidence\n31. Mr Morgan relies on 6 comparables which he says were sold between\nJanuary 2019 and July 2022 or having a floor area similar to the subject\nproperty of between 506 ft.² and 690 ft.²\n32. 19a Goodwyn Avenue is the primary comparable on which Mr Morgan\nrelies. He considers it is a smaller flat being on the upper floor with no\nopportunity to extend. Updating the selling price to the valuation date\ngives a price of £501,357. Applying the same rate per square foot to the\nsubject property gives a value for the subject flat £596,582 plus the value\nof the right to extend taking the full value to £671,582.\n33. Relying on one comparable is not good valuation practice so taking into\naccount all his comparables he arrives at a value of £450,000 for the\nfreehold interest. He then deducts £10,000 as the value of the\nimprovements leaving £440,000 as the unimproved freehold value.\n34. The statement of case on behalf of the leaseholders includes 2 comparable\nsnapshots from Rightmove Plus relating to 19a Goodwyn Avenue. They\nshow the flat as either having 1 bedroom or 2 bedrooms and a floor area of\neither 47 m² or 85 m². Mr Sonner considers that as Mr Morgan has no\nfirst-hand knowledge of this or any further information the evidence is\nunreliable.\n35. 21 Goodwyn Avenue is a ground floor flat which is said to be similar to the\nsubject property with an extension in the rear garden. The flat sold for\n£471,000 in May 2015 and updating this using land registry data gives a\nfigure in January 2022 of £553,310. Mr Morgan acknowledges that it\nwould normally be too long ago to be a useful comparable but is indicative\nof the value added by an extension. He considers it support his approach.\n6\n\n36. 7 Hale Grove Gardens sold for £465,000 in May 2019. No other\ninformation is available.\n37. 15 Brockenhurst Gardens is a one-bedroom flat which sold in June 2021 4\n£375,000. No further information is available.\n38. 15a Brockenhurst Gardens is a one-bedroom flat which sold for £385,000\nin August 2021. No further particulars or details of be provided.\n39. 27 Millway is a two-bedroom ground floor flat sold for £370,000 in June\n2020. No further particulars of been provided.\n40. Flat B, 1 Millway sold in September 2021 for £448,000. No further details\nare given. Land registry titles have been provided for these properties\nconfirming the selling price.\n41. The tribunal’s determination\n42. The tribunal determines that the premium to be paid will be £50,159.\nFurthermore, the Tribunal approves the form of draft lease with the\nexclusion of the disputed clauses inserted by the applicant.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\nThe valuation issue\n43. As will be apparent from the list of items not agreed as set out above there\nwas a significant difference in the valuations. In making the valuation we\nare considerably hampered by the lack of information relating to any of the\ncomparables. There are no sales particulars, EPC reports or other\nvaluation reports and neither valuer seems to have any knowledge of the\ncomparables.\n44. Bearing in mind the limited information available to it, the tribunal\nconsiders the most useful comparable is 49a Goodwyn Avenue which is a\nconverted 1st floor flat with one-bedroom and having the benefit of\nparking but no garden. Applying that to the subject property, the tribunal\nconsiders that the lack of parking for the subject property is\ncounterbalanced by the presence of the garden and therefore makes no\nadjustment for either of these factors. The tribunal accepts Mr Morgan’s\npoint that the market today is not the same as in January 2022 due to\nchanges in mortgage conditions, but the evidence is inconclusive as to the\namount by which the value may have changed. Any increase in the value of\nthe property in the early part of 2022 will be offset by the decline in the\nmarket in the later part of the year. Relying on its knowledge and\nexperience the tribunal therefore makes no adjustment.\n7\n\n45. The valuers discussed the question of improvements being the replacement\nof the heating system, replacement of windows with UPVC double glazing\nand alterations to the kitchen and bathroom. On balance the tribunal\nprefers the evidence Mr Morgan that the adjustment is £10,000 with the\nwindows being the major improvement.\n46. The tribunal places little weight on the evidence of properties on the\nmarket in the absence of any sales particulars or information relating to\nthe marketing history. It also does not place any reliance on two-bedroom\nflats which are a different market.\n47. Turning to the parking issue, the tribunal agrees with Mr Sonner that the\nlease prohibits car parking and while the freeholder has taken no\nenforcement action there is no right to which a value can be ascribed.\n48. The statutory valuation formula requires the tribunal to disregard the\nvalue of the rear extension. Mr Morgan considers there is additional value\nto come from the right to carry out the works and relies in particular on the\ndecision of the High Court in Lewisham Investments Ltd v Morgan, a\ncommercial rent review case. As the court pointed out in that case, each\nlease turns on its own merits and the tribunal derives no assistance from a\ncommercial rent review case dealing with the valuation of a residential unit\nunder the statutory formula. Any such extension is likely to be built under\npermitted development rights so there is no planning permission to\nconsider for this property as opposed to any other and in addition upper\nfloor flat have the rights to extend into the roof space where this is\npossible. The tribunal therefore considers that the possibility of utilising\npermitted development rights is already reflected in values.\n49. The tribunal values the leasehold interest at £310,000 with the freehold 1%\nhigher.\nThe Tribunal’s decision\n50. The premium payable is £50,159 as set out in the attached calculation.\nThe lease issue\n51. The latest version of the lease extension deed was produced to the\nTribunal at tab B page 45 of the Bundle. The point in dispute relates to\ninsurance. The Tribunal was able to see in redline the changes\nsuggested by the applicant/tenant and that they have been struck\nthrough as not agreed by the respondent/landlord.\n52. The tenant considers that the current insurance clause should be\nmodified and/or that it is defective because the landlord is only obliged\nto insure the building against “loss or damage by fire and aircraft”.\nFurther the applicant asserts that there is nothing at all in the lease\n8\n\nrequiring the landlord to claim the insurance proceeds in the event of\ndamage by a risk against which it has insured, let alone to lay out those\ninsurance proceeds in remedying any damage caused. The applicant\nsays that this is clearly an error in the drafting and or an unreasonable\nterm that should be corrected.\n53. Under s57(6)(b) of the Act the tenant is seeking to modify a term which\nis allowed where it shows that is reasonable to do so. In the alternative,\nthe tenant submits that the lease should be amended under s57(6)(a)\nbecause it is defective.\nThe effect of statute\n54. The broad principle is that “the new lease … shall be a lease on the same\nterms as those of the existing lease”, as they apply on the date that the s42\nNotice is given to the landlord (s.57(1)), see below for the wording of this\nsection. Gordon v Church Commissioners (LRA/110/2006): \"the starting\npoint is firmly based in the terms of the existing lease\" (at [34]).\n55. Section 57 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act\n1993 provides that: -\nTerms on which new lease is to be granted.\n(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter (and in particular\nto the provisions as to rent and duration contained in\nsection 56(1)), the new lease to be granted to a tenant under\nsection 56 shall be a lease on the same terms as those of the\nexisting lease, as they apply on the relevant date, but with\nsuch modifications as may be required or appropriate to\ntake account—\n(a)of the omission from the new lease of property included in\nthe existing lease but not comprised in the flat;\n(b)of alterations made to the property demised since the grant\nof the existing lease; or\n(c)in a case where the existing lease derives (in accordance with\nsection 7(6) as it applies in accordance with section 39(3)) from\nmore than one separate leases, of their combined effect and of\nthe differences (if any) in their terms\n56. Section 57(6) of the 1993 Act provides that: -\n(6) Subsections (1) to (5) shall have effect subject to any\nagreement between the landlord and tenant as to the terms of\nthe new lease or any agreement collateral thereto; and either of\nthem may require that for the purposes of the new lease any\nterm of the existing lease shall be excluded or modified in so far\nas—\n9\n\n(a)it is necessary to do so in order to remedy a defect in the\nexisting lease; or\n(b)it would be unreasonable in the circumstances to include, or\ninclude without modification, the term in question in view of\nchanges occurring since the date of commencement of the\nexisting lease which affect the suitability on the relevant date of\nthe provisions of that lease.\n57. Accordingly, in order for a party to require the terms of the existing lease\nto be modified the party must satisfy the tribunal that either of the grounds\nin 57 (6) (a) or (b) are made out.\nThe Tribunal’s decision\n58. The tribunal carefully considered submission from both parties. The core\nof the dispute is about what the amendments sought by the applicant are\ntrying to do.\n59. The tribunal determines that what the applicant seeks to insert in the new\nlease is entirely new. There is no such covenant to modify because the\ninsurance arrangements are already dealt with in the existing insurance\nprovisions. The proposed clauses are entirely new to the lease. The tribunal\nhas no jurisdiction pursuant to section 57(6) of the 1993 Act to require a\nnew term in the format of the proposed insertions proposed by the\napplicant. In the case of Gordon v Church Commissioners LRA/110/2006\nit was made clear that wholly new terms cannot be inserted in the new\nlease under the terms of section 57(6) of the 1993 Act. The decision makes\nit plain that in the absence of agreement between the parties, statute will\nnot include new terms under this section. Paragraph 41 of that decision\nconfirms this clear interpretation of the section where Judge Huskinson\nwrites “In my judgment there is no power under section57(6) for a party\nto require that there is added into the new lease a new provision which is\nnot to be found in the old lease”. The tribunal noted that the case of\nGordon was applied by the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal in Cadogan v\nChelsea Properties Limited (No 2) (Unreported 2008).\n60. The current lease is, in the Tribunal’s view, not defective in that there is an\nexisting mechanism to insure the property. To make changes would create\nanomalies with the lease of the other flat in the building. The legislation\ncontemplates the correction of existing defects, statute talks about\nremedying a defect in the existing lease. However, there is no such existing\ndefect in the existing lease, in that it does provide insurance provisions\nalbeit not to the liking of the applicant, but that is not something the\nTribunal can remedy.\n61. Accordingly, the Tribunal approves the form of draft lease with the\nexclusion of the disputed clauses inserted by the applicant.\n62.

The form of remote hearing was P: PAPERREMOTE. A face-to-\nface hearing was not held because it was not practicable, and all issues could be\ndetermined in a remote hearing on paper. The documents that the Tribunal\nwere referred to are included in a number of separate documents with a\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nseparate Index (not a single indexed and paginated hearing bundle) the\ncontents of which have been noted.\nThe tribunal’s summary decision\n(1) The tribunal finds that the respondent’s reasonable costs amount to\n£3,106.80 of which £1,406.80 remains to be paid by the applicant.\nThe application\n1. This an application pursuant to section 6o of the Leasehold Reform,\nHousing and Urban Development Act 1993 (‘the 1993 Act’) seeking the\ntribunal’s determination as to the reasonable costs, payable in respect of\na deemed withdrawn ‘Notice of Intent’ to seek a lease extension of the\nsubject premises situated at 15B Pownell Gardens, Hounslow TW3 3SU\n(‘the premises’).\nBackground\n2. The applicant served a Notice of Claim dated 19 February 2020, and the\nrespondent served a Counter-Notice dated 13 October 2020. For reasons\nthat are not entirely clear to the tribunal, the applicant failed to proceed\nwith his intended acquisition of a new lease. Consequently, on or about\n4 May 2021, the Notice was deemed withdrawn in accordance with s.53\nof the 1993 Act. Consequently, the applicant is liable to pay the\nrespondent’s reasonable costs of the failed transaction.\nThe issues\n3. The respondent has stated that costs of £3,106.80 (including VAT) are\npayable by the respondent. This is made up of £950 plus VAT for the\nsurveyor’s fees and £1,630.20 plus VAT for the legal costs of JPC Law.\nThe respondent accepts that the applicant has paid £1,700 as a security\ndeposit which will be offset against these costs and asserts that\n£1,406.80 remains outstanding.\nThe applicant’s case\n4. The applicant relied on a written Statement of Case and Submissions\ndated 8 October 2021 and disputes the reasonableness of these costs. As\nwell as relying upon his own personal circumstances of being elderly and\nunwell, asserts that the surveyors fee should be in the region of £450 (no\nVAT) as quoted by his surveyor BANCO Surveyors Limited and that the\nlegal costs should be in the region of £800 as quoted by his own legal\nrepresentatives, AMJ Legal. The applicant asserts that little work was\n2\n\ndone by or on behalf of the respondent in this matter and that the costs\nhave been unreasonably inflated.\nThe respondent’s case\n5. The respondent relies upon the invoice of Jason Mellor of Maunder\nTaylor Surveyors dated 11 August 2020 and accompany breakdown in an\nemail dated 23 August 2021 in the sum of £950 plus VAT) in respect of\nthe surveyor’s fees. The respondent also provided the tribunal with a\nbreakdown of the legal costs incurred in respect of the s42 Notice dated\n10 November 2020 in the sum of £1,966.80.\nThe tribunal decision and reasons\n6. The tribunal determines that the claim for surveyor’s fees is reasonable\nand payable in the sum of £950 (plus VAT). The tribunal also determines\nthat legal costs of £1966.80 are also reasonable and payable by the\napplicant.\n7. The personal circumstances of the applicant are not relevant to this\napplication as the tribunal can only consider the reasonableness of the\ncosts incurred under the provisions of the 1993 Act. Although the\napplicant may not have chosen to use the services of the surveyor or legal\nfirm relied upon by the respondent, the tribunal finds that it was not\nunreasonable for the respondent to choose to do so.\n8. Therefore, the tribunal determines that the applicant is liable to pay to\nthe respondent s.60 costs in the sum of £3,106.80 of which £1,406.80\nremains outstanding.\nName: Judge Tagliavini Dated: 26 October 2021\nRights of appeal from the decision of the tribunal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\n3\n\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e., give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n4"

By way of Directions issued on 12 October 2018, the Respondent was invited to\nadvise the Tribunal by 30 October 2018 if the application was opposed and on\nwhat grounds.\n3. No response was received. The Tribunal therefore proceeded to make its\ndetermination on the basis that the Applicant did not object to the application.\nThe Law\n4. Paragraph 28 (1) of the Mobile Homes Act 1983 sets out the requirements to be\nmet by an association.\n28(1) A residents’ association is a qualifying association in relation to a\nprotected site if –\n(a) it is an association representing the occupiers of mobile homes on that site;\n(b) at least 50% of the occupiers of the mobile homes on that site are members\nof the association;\n(c) it is independent from the owner, who together with any agent or\nemployee of his is excluded from membership;\n(d) subject to paragraph (c) above, membership is open to all occupiers who\nown a mobile home on that site;\n(e) it maintains a list of members which is open to public inspection together\nwith the rules and constitution of the residents’ association;\n(f) it has a chairman, secretary and treasurer who are elected by and from\namong the members;\n(g) with the exception of administrative decisions taken by the chairman,\nsecretary and treasurer acting in their official capacities, decisions are\ntaken by voting and\nPage 2 of 4\n\n(h) the owner has acknowledged in writing to the secretary that the\nassociation is a qualifying residents’ association or, in default if this, the\nTribunal has so ordered.\nDetermination\n5. Following an initial review of the application, the Tribunal requested additional\ninformation in order to ascertain if the provisions of Paragraph 28 (1) had been\nmet.\n6. Following a further review of the information supplied, and in the absence of an\nobjection by the Respondent Site Owner, the Tribunal considers that the\nApplicant has met the requirements of Paragraph 28 (1) of the Mobile Homes Act\n1983 and accordingly finds that Castlewood Residents’ Association should be\nafforded qualifying residents’ association status under the Mobile Homes Act\n1983.\nAppeal\n7. Any appeal against this decision must be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber). Prior to making such an appeal an aggrieved party must apply in\nwriting to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to appeal within 28 days of the\ndate specified below stating the grounds on which that party intends to rely in\nthe appeal.

The form of remote hearing was V: CVP VIDEO HEARING REMOTE.\nA face-to-face hearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues\ncould be determined in a remote hearing. The documents that the Tribunal was\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nreferred to are in a bundle of 218 pages and in the Respondent’s expert report\nand list of comparable properties (which were provided separately), the\ncontents of which we have noted. The order made is described below.\nThe Tribunal’s decision\nThe Tribunal determines that the price payable on the collective\nenfranchisement of Shere Lodge, 48 Harewood Road, London NW19 2HD is\n£76,232.\nBackground\n1. This application concerns a collective enfranchisement claim made\nunder the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993\n(“the 1993 Act”).\n2. The claim is made in respect of a property known as Shere Lodge, 48\nHarewood Road, London NW19 2HD (“Shere Lodge”). The Applicant is\nthe nominee purchaser and the Respondent holds the reversionary\ninterest in Shere Lodge.\n3. Shere Lodge is a three storey, purpose-built 1970s block containing nine\nflats which is situated close to the Colliers Wood underground station.\nThere are garden areas, a car parking area with allocated parking spaces,\nand two garages. The freehold of one of the garages is demised to Flat 3\nShere Lodge and the other is separately owned and not within the\nproperty which the Applicant seeks to acquire.\n4. Shere Lodge is situated in a residential area which comprises Edwardian\nand Victorian housing, together with a few more modern blocks.\n5. The claim was initiated by an initial notice given by the Applicant\npursuant to section 13 of the 1993 Act on 27 October 2020, which is the\nagreed valuation date. A counter-notice was served on 5 January 2021.\n6. The price payable for the freehold on an acquisition pursuant to a notice\nserved under section 13 of the 1993 Act is governed by Schedule 6 to the\n1993 Act, applied by section 32.\n7. The only issue in dispute is whether the price payable for the freehold\nshould include a sum to reflect development value. The parties have\nconfirmed that there is no dispute as to the law and that the sole areas of\ndispute concern the expert valuation evidence.\n8. The parties’ respective valuers have agreed that, apart from any value\nattributable to any right to construct new flats at Shere Lodge, the\n2\n\npurchase price payable by the Applicant for the freehold interest is\n£76,232.\nThe hearing\n9. The hearing of this application took place by CVP video on 8 March 2022.\nThe Applicant was represented at the hearing by Mr Bredemear of\nCounsel, instructed by ZGRP Limited, and the Respondent was\nrepresented by Mr Bromilow of Counsel, instructed by Kloosmans\nSolicitors.\n10. The Tribunal heard oral expert evidence on behalf of the Applicant from\nMr White BSc MRICS, and oral expert evidence on behalf of the\nRespondent from Mr Deacon BSc FRICS. Both experts had submitted\nwritten reports. The hearing was also attended by Mr Curtis, the\nApplicant’s solicitor, and by Mr Kloosman, the Respondent’s solicitor.\n11. On 7 March 2022, an application on the part of the Respondent to\nadjourn the hearing was refused by a Procedural Judge. The documents\nrelied upon by the parties were then served shortly before the hearing.\n12. Insofar as is necessary, the Tribunal extends time under the Directions\nwhich have been given in this matter pursuant to rule 6(3)(a) of the\nTribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013\nto enable the parties to rely upon the documents which were referred to\nat the hearing. These documents are relevant to the issues in dispute and\nno objection was taken by either party to the late service of the other\nparty’s documents.\n13. During the course of the hearing, the Tribunal was referred to plans and\ncolour photographs of Shere Lodge and no inspection was requested. In\nall the circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is not necessary to\ncarry out an inspection.\nThe Tribunal’s determination\n14. Mr White gave oral evidence confirming the opinion which is set out in\nhis expert report dated 3 March 2022. At paragraphs 6 and 7 of his\nreport, he states:\n“6. … In my opinion, this is not a property which is suitable for\ndevelopment. The principal reason is that the property has a shallow\npitched roof formed of a timber truss and therefore in order to add an\nadditional storey it would be necessary to remove the trussed roof\nwhich supports the ceilings for the three flats on the second floor. I do\nnot consider that it would be reasonable to carry out works which are\nso disruptive to the occupation of the upper flats and there is little doubt\nthat the occupiers of these flats would object strongly to any such\n3\n\nscheme. Whilst the structure may technically be adequate to support an\nadditional storey it would be necessary to acquire the interests of the\nlessees of the top floor flats or, at least, to pay compensation to those\nlessees for the disturbance caused. In my view this would render any\nproposed scheme unviable.\nThe other principal reason for this property being unsuitable for\ndevelopment is that it is located in an area where all properties in the\nimmediate surrounding area are of two or three storeys in height but\nnone are any higher than this. Initial discussions with the planning\ndepartment at Merton Borough Council suggest that the impact upon\nthe street scene of an upward extension is such that it would be unlikely\nto receive prior approval regardless of whether or not the property\nqualifies for extension under permitted development rules.\nI am therefore of the opinion that a prospective purchaser of the\nfreehold interest acquiring the freehold with a view to extending the\nproperty would find the engineering and planning risks so great as to\npreclude any bid for this property. A prudent buyer would undoubtedly\nassess the level of profit after allowing for planning and engineering\nrisks to be insufficient. It is perhaps not surprising that at the date of\nvaluation there had been no indication from the current freeholder of\nany intention to develop the property despite owning it for many years.\nThere are no plans or drawings in existence outlining any prospective\nscheme and there is no record of any planning application for a scheme\nof any kind at this property.\nIn response to the freeholder's late attempt to attribute an additional\nsum to the agreed premium in respect of loss of development value, I\nhave obtained a report from a local architect, Andrew Catto AADip\nACArch, President of the Association of Consultant Architects. This\ndescribes the issues surrounding any prospective scheme at this\nbuilding.\n…\nI am, of course, aware that previous cases have been heard by the First-\ntier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal where residual valuations have\nproduced a positive figure for the price payable in respect of\ndevelopment hope value. One example of this is Francia Properties\nLimited v St James House Freehold Limited 2018 UKUT 79 LC. In that\ncase, a discount of 65% was applied to the residual amount to reflect\nplanning and engineering risks. This despite the fact that the local\nPlanning Officer had indicated, before the valuation date, that some\nform of development might be acceptable and a planning application\nhad been lodged. Furthermore, there were taller buildings in the\nimmediate vicinity and the existing building had a flat roof. In the case\nof Shere Lodge there had been no planning applications or discussions\nsurrounding a potential development. There are no taller buildings in\n4\n\nthe immediate vicinity and the property has a pitched, trussed roof. The\ndegree of planning and engineering risk facing a potential purchaser\nwould therefore, logically, be far greater than in the Francia Properties\ncase.\nSummary & Conclusions:\n7. For the reasons given at 6 above, I am of the opinion that it is not\nappropriate to attribute an additional sum in respect of loss of potential\ndevelopment value. The current structure may or may not be suitable\nfor one or more additional floors. The likelihood of achieving sufficient\nprofit to merit undertaking a scheme is too remote to attract a third-\nparty purchaser of the freehold. The absence of planning consent and\nthe likelihood of obtaining planning consent or prior approval is\nsufficiently remote that no prospective purchaser would consider\npaying an additional sum in the hope of carrying out a development at\nthis property.”\n15. Mr Deacon relies upon a structural engineer’s report from Mr Daniel\nClaydon of Barker Associates and upon a planning report from Mr Kevin\nChitty. He states under the heading “Valuation” at pages 7-8 of an expert\nreport which appears to be undated:\n“The valuation is based on the Feasibility Report and comparables of\nRightmove new build properties for sale, these are appended. The last\nsale at 8 Shere Lodge, a one bedroom flat, completed on 15th March\n2021 at £322,500.\nNew build units will obtain a premium and new build flats will be\nsubject to a new build premium with newly constructed building\nenvelope and fittings, especially in an established developed area, close\nto transport links including Collier Wood underground station. Those\nflats constructed above the existing flats will have the benefits of views\nof the surrounding area.\nNo allowance for a lift has been made in respect of a lift installation.\nThe presence of lifts in the attached Rightmove comparables is not\nmentioned for any of the blocks which range up to 5 stories in height.\nCOMPARABLES:\n1. Flat 8, Shere Lodge, 48, Harewood Road, London, London SW19 2HD\nSecond floor flat – Leasehold – 15th March 2021 at £322,500\n2. New flats – There are 29 flats for sale/under offer within ½ mile of\nthe subject property in the price range starting at £400,000 for a one\n5\n\nbedroom flat to £500,000 for a two bedroom flat. Please find attached\nthe twenty pages of comparables obtained from Rightmove.\n3. The values placed on the 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom flats fall within\nthe range of the flats for sale.”\n16. Mr Deacon then sets out residual valuations and explains the various\nfigures and discounts which he has applied. In oral giving evidence Mr\nDeacon confirmed, on being pressed to specify a figure, that in his\nopinion the development value of Shere Lodge is £421,161.\n17. The Tribunal has considered the expert reports and exhibits in full and\nnotes that, as stated by Mr Bromilow, the difference between the two\nvaluers is primarily due to the different values they have attributed to the\nflats in the proposed completed development and to their assessment of\nthe level of compensation which will have to be paid to the\nowners/occupiers of the three upper flats at Shere Lodge to persuade\nthem agree to vacate their flats whilst the proposed development work is\ncarried out.\n18. In his report, Mr Deacon has considered the possibility of adding both a\nthird and a fourth floor and the possibility of only adding a third floor to\nShere Lodge. However, in giving oral evidence, he stated that it is most\nlikely that a hypothetical purchaser would only take into account the\npotential to add a third floor to Shere Lodge.\n19. In Mr Deacon’s opinion, this proposed additional floor would comprise\ntwo one-bedroom flats valued at £365,000 per flat and one two-bedroom\nflat valued at £500,000. Mr Deacon considers that there is also potential\nto carry out a side development above the car parking area containing\ntwo two-bedroom flats which he values at £550,000 per flat. Mr White\nvalues the proposed one-bedroom flats at £325,000 per flat and the\nproposed two-bedroom flat at £425,000.\n20. As regards the level of compensation which would be likely to be payable\nto the owners/occupiers of the three upper flats at Shere Lodge to\npersuade them agree to vacate their flats whilst the proposed\ndevelopment work is carried out, Mr White puts forward a figure of\n£50,000 per flat and Mr Deacon puts forward a figure of £10,000 per\nflat.\n21. It is common ground that three flats on the upper floor of Shere Lodge\nwould need to be vacated in order for the proposed development work to\ntake place and that the owners/occupiers of these flats cannot be\nrequired to leave in the absence of an agreement. Mr White is of the\nopinion that the proposed development works would be likely to take in\nthe region of 12 months to complete and that the flats would need to be\nvacant for the entirely of this period. Mr Deacon is of the view that a\n6\n\ncrash deck could be installed above each flat and that the flats would only\nneed to be vacated for 14 days to enable this to happen following which\nthe development work could proceed above occupied flats.\n22. The Tribunal prefers the expert opinion of Mr White to that of Mr Deacon\nfor the following reasons:\n(i) Mr Deacon’s oral evidence concerning whether or not\nhe was attributing value to a potential fourth floor\nlacked clarity with incorrect figures initially given\norally, whereas Mr White was clear and consistent in\nhis conclusions.\n(ii) In assessing the likely value of the new flats in the\nproposed development, Mr White provided evidence\nof sale prices and made clear and reasoned\nadjustments in a table at appendix 8 to his report. He\ndid not rely upon new build comparables but he made\nan upwards adjustment to reflect the fact that the new\nflats would be in a new structure situated above a\n1970s block. Save in respect of Flat 8 Shere Lodge,\nMr Deacon relied upon asking prices rather than\nsales evidence and, in respect of properties which\nwere under offer, he made no investigations to\nascertain the proposed purchased price. None of Mr\nDeacon’s new build comparables included one-\nbedroom flats and he did not provide any analysis of\nhis comparables showing the nature of any\nadjustments made for time and for favourable and\nunfavourable features relative to the proposed new\nflats.\n(iii) Mr Deacon’s evidence concerning the allowance a\nhypothetical purchaser would be like to make for the\ncost of securing vacant possession of the three upper\nflats on a temporary basis was based upon the\nerroneous assumption that, under the flat leases,\nthere is a right to undertake the proposed\ndevelopment works unless the lessees can mount a\ncogent case against the proposed development.\nFurther, in our view Mr Deacon’s evidence that the\nsecond-floor flats would only need to be vacant for a\nperiod of 14 days and that the hypothetical purchaser\nwould allow £10,000 per flat is unrealistic. Even if it\nis possible to put down a crash deck, the level of\ncompensation would still have to reflect the fact that\nowners and/or occupiers of the upper flats would\nthen live directly below a building site for a period of\napproximately 12 months whilst the development\n7\n\nwork was carried out (or might well insist upon being\nrelocated for 12 months in order to avoid this). The\ncompensation would have to cover the fact that,\nfollowing the completion of the proposed\ndevelopment work, the second-floor flats would have\nother flats above them with the risk of noise and leaks\nfrom above. The hypothetical purchaser would also\nhave to take account of the risk that one or more of\nthe relevant people might be firmly opposed and\nblock the proposed development.\n(iv) We accept the evidence of Mr White that he spoke by\ntelephone to the duty planning officer who stated that\nhe thought it unlikely that planning consent would be\nobtained for the proposed development, although he\nwas not prepared to rule it out. Having considered\nthe nature of surrounding area, which predominantly\ncomprises two storey period properties, and applying\nour general knowledge and experience as an expert\ntribunal, we consider it likely that there would be\nresistance to the proposed development (which\nwould result in Shere Lodge becoming taller than any\nother building in the vicinity).\n(v) We also note that Mr Deacon’s residual valuation for\na proposed development with two additional storeys\nresults in a figure only approximately £5,000 higher\nthan his residual valuation for a proposed\ndevelopment consisting of one additional storey and\nthat Mr Deacon has not produced any evidence of\nsales of or offers for airspace in the vicinity of Shere\nLodge.\n23. Where the evidence of Mr Deacon differs from that of Mr White, we\nprefer the evidence of Mr White. Mr White explained that he did not\nconsider the possibility of a side development above the parking area\nbecause he was not aware that this was being contended for by the\nRespondent when he prepared his report. However, having accepted Mr\nWhite’s evidence concerning the likely value which would be attributed\nto proposed new flats at Shere Lodge, we are satisfied that a hypothetical\npurchaser would be unlikely to consider the proposed side development\nto be viable.\n24. On the basis of the evidence of Mr White, the Tribunal finds on the\nbalance of probabilities that a hypothetical purchaser would not pay any\nadditional sum in the hope of carrying out a development at Shere Lodge.\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that the price payable on the\ncollective enfranchisement of Shere Lodge is £76,232.\n8\n\nName: Judge N Hawkes Date: 4 April 2022\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, Cambrai Court and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n9"

The costs incurred for repairs to or renewal of conservatory roofs at\nBudgenor Lodge in the service charge years 2016/2017 and 2017/2018\nare not payable as service charges under the Leases of Budgenor Lodge\non the evidence presented to the Tribunal.\n2. The £1788.30 claimed as service charges in a written demand\naddressed to Mr. and Mrs. Cooper as lessees of 1 Budgenor Lodge dated\n31 10 2017 is not payable as a service charge under the terms of their\nLease.\n3. The Tribunal is unable to determine whether if costs were incurred in\nthe future for repair, maintenance or renewal of conservatory roofs in\nBudgenor Lodge, such costs would be recoverable as service charges\nunder paragraphs 7 or 10 of the First Schedule and clauses 2.2 and the\nSeventh Schedule to the Lease, as it does not have specific proposals or\ncosts which it is asked to rule upon.\n4. None of the costs of these Tribunal proceedings or management costs\nrelating to these Tribunal proceedings are relevant costs for the\npurpose of service charges, under section 20C of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985.\n5. The Tribunal makes no order for reimbursement of application or\nhearing fees incurred by the Applicants.\nReasons for the Final Decision\nScope of the Final Decision\n6. Broadly, the conclusions reached in the Interim Decision of 24th May\n2018 hold good. This Final Decision should not be read or understood\nas concluding that works to conservatory roofs could never be charged\nto service charge under the Lease. This Final Decision concludes that\nupon the particular evidence put before the Tribunal and the service\ncharge demands made available after the Interim Decision, the costs of\nconservatory works claimed in the Service Charges Demands at pages\n252-262 of the Hearing Bundle, are not payable as service charge by\nany of the Lessees who are parties to this application.\n7. This Final Decision does not act as a binding precedent. It does not\ndetermine whether costs of conservatory works can or cannot be\ncharged to service charge in the future for the reasons given below. Nor\nis this Final Decision, a decision upon whether in other service charge\nyears, the costs of conservatory works were properly charged to service\ncharge. The Tribunal has not been asked to determine that issue.\n2\n\n8. If there is doubt about whether such costs could be properly charged to\nservice charge, an application to the Tribunal could be made in advance\nof the costs being incurred and before the service charge demand is\nissued under section 27A(3) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the\nAct”). That has not been done in this case.\n9. To clarify. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide whether\nthe conservatory owners such as 1 Budgenor Lodge are liable for those\ncosts or some other cost of works to the conservatories, unless those\ncosts are claimed as service charges. There may be other legal grounds\nupon which conservatory owners are liable for those costs, assuming\nthe costs have been incurred by the First Respondent. The issue of what\nthat liability might be is not within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to\ndetermine.\nThe application\n10. The Applicants seek a determination pursuant to Section 27A(1) of the\nAct as to the amount of service charges payable by the Applicants in\nrespect of the service charge years 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 for\nrepairs to conservatory roofs at 1 Budgenor Lodge. This application was\ntaken in addition to refer to the cost of renewal of the conservatory\nroof.\n11. At the hearing on 20th February 2019, it became apparent that the\napplication was also intended to seek guidance generally for all Lessees\nat Budgenor Lodge whether the costs of repairs to conservatory roofs\nwould be payable as service charges under the terms of the Leases if\nsuch costs were incurred in addition to the question whether the cost\nincurred in the specified service charge years. The application had not\nbeen drafted with professional assistance. All parties treated the\nhearing as dealing with the wider question of whether the costs of\nrepairs to conservatory roofs would be payable as service charges under\nthe terms of the Leases. The Tribunal accordingly treated the\napplication as addressing that issue under section 27A(3) of the Act as\nwell as the question of whether the costs incurred for such works in the\nservice charge years 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 were payable.\n12. The Tribunal’s decision is only binding upon those lessees who were\nparties to this application.\n13. No specific costs or proposals were available for future works to\nconservatory roofs. Accordingly the Tribunal has been unable to\ndetermine the question whether the future costs of repairs to\nconservatory roofs would be payable as service charges under the terms\nof the Lease. The provision of section 27A (3) of the Act require the\nTribunal to make a determination upon specific costs: see Jarowicki v\nFreehold Managers (Nominees) Limited v Prokhorov [2016] UKUT\n435 (LC). However the Tribunal considered argument on this issue in\n3\n\nthe context of the costs incurred for service charge years 2016/2017 and\n2017/2018 and its conclusions are recorded in these reasons.\n14. The relevant legal provisions are set out in Appendix A to this decision.\nProcedure\n15. The Tribunal issued directions on 10th November 2017 (“the Initial\nDirections”) indicating this application was to be determined without a\nhearing in accordance with rule 31 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier\nTribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013/1169 (“the 2013 Rules”),\nunless any party objected to that procedure within 28 days of receipt of\nthe Initial Directions.\n16. The Initial Directions recorded that the Applicants consented to a\ndetermination without a hearing by e-mail of 20th October 2017. No\nparty indicated that a hearing was required.\n17. At that stage the statements and letters from other lessees included\nwithin the Determination bundle at section 4 (Colin Sanderson and\nEnny Sanderson of 10th December 2017, Jacob GP Roell of 5th\nDecember 2017, Kate Henderson of 5th December 2017, TS Manns of\n12th December 2017) did not indicate that a hearing was requested or\nrequired.\n18. The Tribunal reached an Interim Decision 24th May 2018 and in that\nDecision issued directions requiring further evidence to be provided to\nthe Tribunal for its Final Decision. Those directions invited the\nRespondent Budgenor Lodge Limited (then the only Respondent) to\nprovide that copies of the Interim Decision to each lessee at Budgenor\nLodge and to seek their consent to being bound by the final decision of\nthe Tribunal. That consent was not forthcoming.\n19. On 31st October 2018 the Tribunal ordered Mrs Carole Moller, Mr\nMitchell Burman, Mrs J Halpin, Mr R Slade and Mr Douglas\nShakespeare to be joined as Respondents to the application. It\nappeared to the Tribunal Judge at that stage that it was appropriate to\ndo so in the light of correspondence from them commenting upon the\nInterim Decision.\n20. On 15th November 2018 earlier directions were varied at their request\nto enable the Second, Third, Fifth and Sixth Respondents to seek\nprofessional advice.\n21. On 3rd January 2019 the Tribunal Judge considered that the letters and\ndocuments that had been filed meant that the application was not\nsuitable for determination without a hearing. The hearing on 20th\nFebruary 2019 (“the hearing”) was then arranged.\n4\n\nAttendance at hearing on 20th February 2019\n22. At the hearing Mr Deadman director attended and represented the\nFirst Respondent Budgenor Lodge Limited. He was assisted by Mr\nBarrett, the lessee of 26 Budgenor Lodge. Each of the other\nRespondents attended save for Mrs Jenni Halpin who was said to have\nbeen absent abroad. No request to adjourn\nthe hearing was made by her or on her behalf and she was not\nrepresented at the hearing but, had sent a written statement at page\n263 of the Hearing Bundle which the Tribunal takes into account.\n23. In addition, Mr Peter Moller the joint lessee of 38 Budgenor Lodge\nand a director of the First Respondent until his resignation about a\nyear ago, attended and spoke in support of his wife’s (Carole Moller)\nposition. Mrs Rosalind Davies of 2 Budgenor Lodge and Miss Kathryn\nHenderson of 30 Budgenor Lodge also attended.\nThe Hearing bundle\n24. The Hearing Bundle consisted of 303 pages and was considerably\nlarger than the Determination Bundle utilised for the Interim Decision.\nThe Hearing Bundle was supplemented by coloured copies of plans\ndesignated as plans A, B, C and D in the Lease (monochrome copies of\nwhich were at pages 66-70 of the hearing bundle). Service charge\naccounts for Budgenor Lodge for the year ending 31 January 2017\ndated September 207 and draft service accounts for the year ended 31\nJanuary 2018 dated March 2018 were, at the request of the Tribunal,\nalso introduced into evidence.\nTerminology\n25. References to page numbers in these Reasons are to the Hearing\nBundle. Some of the correspondence and statements in the Hearing\nbundle contains use of terminology which might give rise to confusion.\nIn these Reasons references to lessees include lessees who have 125\nyear leases and 999 leases. References to “freehold owners” or\nfreeholders are to those owners who are not lessees. References to\n“shareholders” in this Decision or the Interim Decision are to those\nmembers of the First Respondent who have rights as members of that\ncompany, which is a company limited by guarantee without shares. As\nMr Moller correctly noted, the members are not shareholders in the\nlegal sense.\nStatus of these reasons\n26. Many of the issues were the subject of extended debate. These reasons\nsummarise the key points which the Tribunal thought were of\nrelevance. They do not rehearse every single argument or piece of\nevidence.\n5\n\nThe background - Budgenor Lodge\n27. All parties agreed Budgenor Lodge is a Grade II Listed building in\nEaseborne built in the late 18th century as a workhouse (Midhurst\nUnion workhouse). In 2007 it was redeveloped into private residential\ndwellings together with other buildings now known as Budgenor Lodge.\nThe main building (“the Main Lodge”) faces east and has a hipped tiled\nroof. The First Respondent landlord is a company whose members are\nrestricted to those who are leasehold owners and whose directors are\nalso members. The First Respondent appears to have acquired the\nfreehold of Budgenor Lodge (as defined below) in 2015. The First\nRespondent was not the original landlord at the time of the\nredevelopment in 2007. The original landlord appears to have been a\ncommercial entity.\n28. Budgenor Lodge consists of 42 dwellings, some of which were added as\n“new build” at the time of the redevelopment in 2007. At the relevant\ntimes the development comprised 21 apartments in the Main Lodge\nBuilding, 11 houses and 3 apartments in two wings, 4 apartments in a\nseparate building and 3 “freehold” new build cottages. This was\ncommon ground.\n29. There are only 39 leasehold properties governed by the relevant Lease,\nalthough the freehold owners (that is those who are not lessees) also\ncontribute to the costs of the Budgenor Lodge estate. Some 12 of the\nlessees at Budgenor Lodge hold 125 year leases and are not members or\nofficers of Budgenor Lodge Limited the landlord. The remaining lessees\nare members of Budgenor Lodge Limited the landlord.\n30. A schematic representation of the development known as Budgenor\nLodge can be found in the plans incorporate into the Lease labelled A,\nB, C, D and E at pages 66 - 70. The Tribunal has assumed these plans\nare the same as the supplemental plans referred to in the official copy\nof the freehold title held by Budgenor Lodge. None of the parties took\nissue with the validity or authenticity of the plans, colour copies of\nwhich were provided to the parties who attended the hearing.\nThe topography of the conservatories\n31. A colour photograph of Unit 1’s “conservatory” is at page 14 and at the\nfar left of the photographs at pages 14A and 14B. Six of the\nconservatories are on the southern external elevation of the Budgenor\nLodge (to the left of page [66]) and are depicted on page [14C]. It was\nnot disputed that the “conservatory” for each of the 11 apartments was\nnot a later addition but an integral structure to the conversion of\nBudgenor Lodge with a brick partition wall between the dwellings and\nthe conservatories. The letter of 14 December 2017 from William\nCooper the First Applicant makes this clear.\n6\n\n32. The photographs show that the conservatories are a ground floor\nstructure with a sloping glass roof. It was asserted and the Tribunal\nfinds, that the only glass roofs in Budgenor Lodge at the date of the\nhearing are the conservatory roofs. Skylights in the development were\nsaid to be perspex. The Tribunal finds that photographs and\ndescription to be typical of the layout of the conservatories at Budgenor\nLodge.\n33. Plans A, B and C (pages 66-68) incorporated into the specimen Lease\ndepict the conservatory as a ground floor structure named as “Garden\nRoom” in the legend to the plans. Mr Deadman at the hearing agreed\nthat garden room on the plans represented the location of the\nconservatories. None of the parties disagreed with this.\n34. Plan B (the first floor plan) depicts the conservatory roofs. It is unclear\nfrom the red edging in Plans A and Plan B whether those roofs were\nintended to fall within the demise (the grant) to the Lessees of the units\nwith the conservatory. The red edging is expressed to be “for the\npurpose of identification only” in the definition of “the Unit” in clause\n1.1 on page 5 of the Lease. Accordingly, the presence or absence of red\nedging around the conservatory roofs is not conclusive of whether the\nroofs are part of the structure demised for the reasons given below.\nThe leasehold structure\n35. In the light of documents supplied since the Interim Decision it is clear\nthe Applicants hold a long lease of the property for a term of 999 years\nfrom 25th March 2015 and the Lease described in the Interim Decision\nhad been surrendered and replaced by a new Lease granted on 11th June\n2015: see pages 97-101. All parties agreed the material provisions of the\n125 year and 999 year leases are the same. The Lease requires the First\nRespondent Landlord to provide services and the Lessee to contribute\ntowards their costs by way of a variable service charge. The specific\nprovisions of the lease will be referred to below, where appropriate.\n36. All parties agreed that all the leases (including those dwellings which\ndo not have a conservatory) are in substantially the same form as the\nLease at pages 26-70 except that the percentage contributions for\nvarious categories of service charges at pages 9- 12 of the Lease varied\nbetween leases. Some lessees placed emphasis upon the fact that the\npercentage in their Lease for the “Conservatory Charge Percentage” at\npage 11 said “nil”. Mr Deadman noted that the percentages as between\nvarious conservatory owners for the Conservatory Charge varied\naccording to square footage. This was illustrated by the photograph at\npage 14A where it was apparent that the eastern most conservatory was\nsmaller than other conservatories in that photograph.\n37. Clause 1.1 of the Lease contains a large number of definitions. One of\nthe key definitions for the purpose of understanding the service charge\nprovisions of the Lease is “the Units”. This phrase is defined on page 12\nof the Lease to mean:\n7\n\n“the Premises and all the other units contained in the\nBuilding and sold or intended to be sold on long leases\nand \"Unit\" shall mean any one of them”.\nThe phrase “the Building” is defined on page 6 of the Lease in clause 1.1\nto mean:\n“all that the land and buildings (including the Units the\nInternal Common Parts and the Main Structure) intended\nto be known as Budgenor Lodge Dodsley Lane\nEasebourne Midhurst West Sussex as the same are shown\nfor the purpose of identification only coloured brown\nmauve and red on Plan D” (emphasis added)\nThe significance of this definition is that “the Units” for this purpose do\nnot include any freehold units or units not coloured brown mauve and\nred on Plan D (“the Estate plan”) (page 69). It has been long settled\nthat emphasised words “for the purpose of identification only” mean\nthat the plan is not determinative or conclusive of whether a piece of\nland is within a “parcels clause” (a clause defining what is transferred\nor conveyed) or demise but the plan may be looked at provided it does\nnot contradict an explicit verbal description. Wigginton & Milner Ltd\nv Winster Engineering Ltd [1978] 1 W.L.R. 1462 is an example of an\napplication of this principle.\nThe scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction\n38. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Act does not extend to\nconsidering the payability or interpretation of any covenants or other\nobligations imposed upon freehold owners in respect of any\ncontribution to the costs under consideration in this Decision. Nothing\nin this Final Decision should be read as determining that issue directly\nor indirectly. As some of the owners of the dwellings might be\nfreeholders, the Tribunal occasionally uses the words owner or dwelling\nowners where it is not necessary to distinguish between lessees and\nsuch owners for the purpose of ascertaining the significance of\napportionment of costs of the Budgenor Lodge development.\n39. The Tribunal is required to determine the answer to the statutory\nquestion posed by section 27A(1)(c) of the Act (the amount payable) by\ndetermining the amounts payable as service charges for conservatory\nroofs as service charges: see Jarowicki v Freehold Managers\n(Nominees) Limited v Prokhorova. Alternatively, if the costs have not\nyet been incurred, the Tribunal is able to determine whether those costs\nwould be payable under the analogous provisions of section 27A(3) of\nthe Act. The Tribunal is not empowered to decide those issues “in\nprinciple” or without providing a determination upon specific amounts\npayable by the Applicants.\n8\n\nLegal principles governing interpretation of Leases (and\nother contracts)\n40. The Tribunal adopts and incorporates into these reasons, the reasons\ngiven in paragraphs 29 -38 of the Interim Decision.\nDefinition and extent of the conservatory within the Lease\n41. The Tribunal adopts and incorporates into these reasons, the reasons\ngiven in paragraphs 39 -45 of the Interim Decision.\nThe service charge provisions in the Lease – initial\nallocations of contribution and percentages\n42. The Tribunal adopts and incorporates into this Decision the reasons\ngiven in paragraphs 46-55 of the Interim Decision.\nThe “Conservatory Charge”\n43. The Tribunal adopts and incorporates into this Decision, the reasons\ngiven in paragraphs 56-62 of the Interim Decision.\nAre repairs to conservatory roofs within the scope of “the\nBuilding Charge”?\n44. The Tribunal addressed this issue in paragraphs 62 -63 of the Interim\nDecision. It is a key issue for deciding whether repairs to conservatory\nroofs can be recovered under Schedule 1 of the Lease.\n45. The “Building Services” which are the subject of “the Building Charge”\nare defined by reference to “the Annual Building Expenditure” and the\nFirst Schedule to the Lease: see the definitions of those terms in clause\n1.1 on page 8 of the Lease (page 35). “Annual Building Expenditure” in\nclause 1.1 is defined to mean:\n“(a) all costs expenses and outgoings whatever incurred\nby the Landlord during a Financial Year in or incidental\nto the provision of all or any of the Building Services and\n(b) any VAT payable on such sums costs expenses and\noutgoings\nbut excluding any expenditure in respect of any part of\nthe Building for which the Tenant or any other tenant is\nwholly responsible and excluding any Annual Building\nExpenditure that the Landlord recovers under any policy\nof insurance maintained by the Landlord pursuant to its\nobligations in this Lease”\n(emphasis added)\n9\n\n46. As far as relevant to conservatory roof repairs, the “Building Services”\nare defined by the First Schedule to the Lease (at pages 60-61) as the\nLandlord’s obligations (subject to the terms of clause 4.3) to mean:\n1. “To maintain in good and substantial repair and\ncondition and renew or replace the Main Structure in\ncompliance with any statutory requirement provided\nthat the Landlord shall not be liable for any disrepair\nuntil the Landlord has had written notice of it from the\nTenant and a reasonable time to remedy it\n2. When necessary but not more often than every 3 years\nand not less often than every 5 years to decorate in a\ngood and workmanlike manner the external parts of the\nBuilding\n3. As and when the Landlord shall consider it necessary to\nclean the windows of the Building (where such windows\nare not included in this demise or in the demise to\nanother tenant)\n4. To pay and discharge any rates (including water rates)\ntaxes duties assessments charges impositions and\noutgoings assessed charged or imposed on the Building\nas distinct from any assessment made in respect of any\nUnit\n5. ……………\n6. …………..\n7. To do or cause to be done all works installations acts\nmatters and things as in the discretion of the Landlord\nmay be considered necessary or desirable for the proper\nmaintenance safety amenity and administration of the\nBuilding including without limitation to the generality\nof the foregoing the provision of security fire safety and\nfire prevention equipment\n8. …….\n9. ………………….\n10. To do all further acts as the Landlord in its discretion\nmay consider necessary or advisable for the proper\nmaintenance safety amenity and administration of the\nBuilding” (emphasis added)\n47. To understand the scope of the landlord’s duty to provide “Building\nServices” it is necessary to return to the definition of “the Building” in\nclause 1.1 on page 6 of the Lease which provides that term means:\n“all that the land and buildings (including the Units the\nInternal Common Parts and the Main Structure) intended\nto be known as Budgenor Lodge Dodsley Lane\nEasebourne Midhurst West Sussex as the same are shown\nfor the purpose of identification only coloured brown\nmauve and red on Plan D”\n10\n\n48. Plan D (on page 69) shows the Units and the conservatories (as well as\nother parts) to be shaded brown. That colouring is consistent with the\nconservatories falling within the meaning of the term “the Building” as\ndefined in clause 1.1 of the Lease.\n49. The phrase “the Units” is defined by clause 1.1 on page 12 of the Lease\nto mean “the Premises and all the other units contained in the Building\nand sold or intended to be sold on long leases and \"Unit\" shall mean\nany one of them”. The term “the Premises” is defined by clause 1.1 on\npage 6 of the Lease to mean “the Unit”.\n50. The phrase “the Unit” is further defined in clause 1.1 on page 5 of the\nLease as follows:\n“all that ground, first and second floor Unit in the\nBuilding shown for the purpose of identification only\nedged red on Plans A, B and C includes:\n(a) the internal non-structural walls within the Unit\n(b) the inner half severed medially of all internal non¬\nstructural walls shared with any other Unit or with the\nCommon Parts\n(c) the floors (including the floor screeds and floor\nfinishes but not any floor joists or slabs) of the Unit\n(d) the ceilings and ceiling finishes but not the beams\njoists or slabs above or forming any part of the ceilings\n(e) the doors door frames windows window frames and\nthe glass in the doors and windows\n(f) the plaster work of all structural walls within or\nbounding the Unit\n(g) all Pipes that exclusively serve the Unit\n(h) all the Landlord's fixtures and fittings and fixtures of\nevery kind that shall from time to time be in or on the\nUnit (whether originally affixed or fastened to or upon\nthe Unit or otherwise) including (without limitation)\nall central heating and air conditioning and water\nventilation and sanitary plant equipment and\napparatus exclusively serving the Unit\n(i) all additions and improvements made to the Unit\nother than Tenant's fixtures and fittings therein at any\ntime during the Term\n(j) All stairs and staircases situated within the Unit and\nall other internal surf aces and partitions therein\n(k) The tiles and surface finishes and boundaries of the\nroof terrace or balcony (if any) forming part of the\nUnit\n(l) The conservatory (if any) and the garden (if any)\nappurtenant to the Unit” (emphasis added)\n11\n\n51. As indicated above, the use of the term “for identification purpose only”\nrelegates the red markings on plans A, B and C, in importance to give\npriority to the verbal description of the Unit.\n52. During the course of the hearing the debate also focused upon the\nmeaning of “the Main Structure” in paragraph 1 of the First Schedule to\nthe Lease. That phrase is defined in clause 1.1 of the Lease at page 33 to\nmean\n“….the whole of the Building excluding the Units and\nthe Internal Common Parts which shall for the\navoidance of doubt but without limitation to the\ngenerality of the foregoing include a(l roofs at all\nlevels of the Building (including all glass roofs or\nskylights) and the foundations of the Building and its\nmain walls (including party walls) and timbers and the\njoists beams and floor slabs supporting the floors in\nthe Building and all other structural parts together\nwith all alterations and additions thereto from time to\ntime”\nSubmissions\n53. The submissions made by or on behalf of Mrs Moller and other\nRespondents who opposed the repairs to conservatory roofs being paid\nfor out of service charge can be summarised, in legal terms, in the\nfollowing ways:\na. The roofs to the conservatories were an integral part of the\nconservatories;\nb. The conservatory roofs were glass;\nc. The roofse to the conservatories were not shared with other parts of\nthe building or development unlike other roofs; each glass roof only\nserved the individual conservatory\nd. The roofs were part of the demise of 1 Budgenor Lodge as indicated\nby the red edging of Unit 1 in Plan A at page 66; accordingly they\nwere not part of the main structure within the landlord’s repairing\ncovenant in paragraph 4.3 and paragraph 1 of the First Schedule\nand the corresponding service charge liability of the lessee\ne. If paragraph 1 of the First Schedule is unclear about whether the\nlandlord has an obligation to undertake repair, renewal or\nreplacement of the glass roof of the conservatory it should be read\nin a way which does not impose a liability on the lessee that would\nnot ordinarily be expected. As the conservatories are for the\nexclusive use and benefit of the individual lessees unlike items such\nas shared roofs or other items clearer words would have been\nexpected to impose such an obligation; that is reflected in the\nseparate apportionment of a conservatory charge for lessees with a\nconservatory on the Fifth Schedule to the Lease.\n12\n\nf. If an obligation to undertake a repair, renewal or replacement of the\nglass roof of the conservatory had been imposed on the landlord,\nthe obvious place where such an obligation would have been\nexpected would have been in the Fifth Schedule and not by a\nstrained reading of paragraph 1 of the First Schedule or in other\nparagraphs of that Schedule;\ng. As the lessees reviewing the Leases of non-conservatory units would\nhave no obvious means of ascertaining potential liability for\nconservatory units, it would have been far from obvious unlike\nshared roofs or gardens that such a liability would be shared and\nservice charge liability and clearer words would have been expected;\n54. Mr Cooper the only lessee with a conservatory before the Tribunal\nadopted a neutral stance to all of these contentions. Very fairly and with\nan admirable desire to avoid or minimise confrontation, he stated that\nthe Applicants simply wanted clarity so that if there for example was a\nsale of a lease with a conservatory all parties and purchasers and\nmortgagees would know where they stood on this issue.\n55. Some of the arguments suggesting that the conservatory roofs fell\nwithin paragraph 1 of The First Schedule were canvassed in the Interim\nDecision. In addition the following point emerged at the hearing about\nparagraph 1 of the First Schedule:\na. as the conservatories were the only structure in the development\nwith a glass roof (at least at the time of the hearing) to give effect to\nthe meaning of “the Main Structure” as defined on page 6 of the\nLease at page 33, the landlord’s obligation in paragraph 1 of the\nFirst Schedule must extend to the conservatory roofs;\nb. that obligation could be interpreted to that the phrase “in\ncompliance with any statutory requirement” is read as qualifying\nthe manner in which the repairing renewal and replacing\nobligations should be carried out, particularly as the building was\nthe subject of listed building legislation.\n56. The submissions made by or on behalf of Mrs Moller and other\nRespondents who opposed the repairs to conservatory roofs being paid\nfor out of service charge in relation to paragraphs 7 and 10 of the First\nSchedule to the Lease (the discretionary power to incur such costs) can\nbe summarised, in legal terms in the following ways:\na. The potential obligation of non-conservatory owners to contribute\nto conservatory costs was far from obvious or clear particularly\nwhen Schedule 5 (the conservatory charge) was considered;\nb. The existence of Schedule 5 should be an important factor in\ndeciding whether paragraphs 7 and 10 of the Frist Schedule should\nbe interpreted in a way in which all owners would be liable for\nconservatory repair/renewal costs;\n13\n\nc. There was a high burden on a landlord to establish that given the\nabsence of a clear obligation for all lessees to contribute to such\ncosts, they could be utilised on a routine or regular basis to include\nall of the costs of conservatory maintenance and repair in service\ncharge even if in an exceptional or intermittent case, such a\ndecision might be made;\nd. That paragraphs 7 and 10 of the First Schedule were “sweeper”\nclauses which should be construed against the background of other\nservices and items for which specific provision had been made in\nthe Lease such as conservatory costs in the Fifth Schedule;\ne. Even if repairs for conservatory roofs fell within the First Schedule\n(such as paragraphs 7 or 10) it was manifestly unfair and\nunreasonable to for the First Respondent landlord to impose that\nliability on lessees who were not conservatory owners. In legal\nterms this was an argument that the First Respondent had exercised\na contractual discretion unreasonably within either of the two limbs\nof the test in Wednesbury decision referred to in Victory Place\nManagement Company Limited v Kuehn at [2018] EWHC 132.\nInterpretation of the Building Charge and the Building\nServices\n57. The provisions of the First Schedule were intended to provide an\nexhaustive code for Building Services. Paragraphs 2-10 of the First\nSchedule were intended to be additional to paragraph 1. Taking the\ndefinition of the Unit in clause 1.1 as including the conservatory, it is\nlikely that the glass roof referred to as part of “the Main Structure” was\nintended to refer to something else other than the conservatory. No\nevidence was adduced as to the existence of glass roofs at the date of\nthe grant of the lease. The Tribunal concludes that it was unlikely that\nof all the parts of the conservatory only the roof would not be part of\nthe unit demised within the definition in clause 1.1. The Tribunal\nconcludes that conservatory roof repairs could not properly have been\ncharged to service charges as they were not part of the Main Structure\nin paragraph 1 of the First Schedule to the Lease.\n58. The First Respondent landlord could have carried out works of repair\nor renewal to conservatory roofs on the basis that they were part of the\nBuilding Services defined in paragraphs 7 or 10 of the First Schedule to\nthe Lease, whether or not the conservatory roofs were demised to the\nlessees. Paragraphs 7 and 10 of the First Schedule empower the\nlandlord:\n“7. To do or cause to be done all works installations acts\nmatters and things as in the discretion of the Landlord\nmay be considered necessary or desirable for the proper\nmaintenance safety amenity and administration of the\nBuilding including without limitation to the generality of\n14\n\nthe foregoing the provision of security fire safety and fire\nprevention equipment”\n……………………\n10. To do all further acts as the Landlord in its discretion\nmay consider necessary or advisable for the proper\nmaintenance safety amenity and administration of the\nBuilding”\n(emphasis added)\n59. For the reasons given in paragraphs 71 - 78 of the Interim Decision,\nthe Tribunal does not accept the reasoning advanced in letters from\nsolicitors consulted by the Landlord or its managing agents Scott Bailey\n(letter 04 April 2017) and MacDonald Oates LLP (20 February 2017)\n(pages 85-91).\n60. Although much was made at the hearing and in written submissions by\nthe Respondents who opposed the conservatory repairs costs being\ncharged to service charge, concerning poor administration or\ninadequate consultation by the First Respondent or the Residents\nAssociation, as explained, these issues have no bearing upon the issue\nof interpretation of the Lease.\nThe costs incurred for the conservatory roof repairs to 1\nBudgenor Lodge in 2016/2017 and 2018/2018\n61. Following the Interim Decision, the Tribunal has been provided with\nevidence about what works were carried out and the costs incurred.\nDisrepair to the conservatory roof of this unit leading to leaks had been\nnoted for some time. Various attempts had been made to solve the\nproblem by repairs. Ultimately a quotation for a new glass roof (the\nrecommended solution) was obtained from Kalglass on 14 03 2016 for a\ntotal of £7200: see pages [197-198]. There is some question whether\nthe £600 additional cost of self-cleaning glass would be paid by the\nlessees Mr and Mrs Cooper but that is not material. The cost agreed\nwas £6600 inclusive of VAT: see the Kalglass letter at page 203 and the\ninvoice at page 204.\n62. Initially Mr Deadman of the First Respondent expressed the view that\nthe renewal works fell within “the Building Services Schedule” for\nService Charges: see his e-mail of 29 03 2016 at page 201.\n63. Subsequently in his letter to Lessees of 31 10 2017 at page 217 Mr\nDeadman indicated that the decision had been made to allocate those\ncosts to what was described as “Schedule 4”. After much questioning\nand some confusion Mr Deadman said that the reference in the letter to\nSchedule 2 was to Schedule 4 of the Lease and the reference to\nSchedule 4 in the letter was to Schedule 1 of the Lease. He said that\n15\n\nthose references in the letter referred to the basis upon which the\nservice charge accounts had been prepared historically.\n64. Along the same lines the Tribunal examined the service charge\naccounts for year ended 31 01 2017 where a total cost of £7716.62 was\nallocated to what was described on page 4b of those accounts as\nSchedule 4 Conservatory expenses (“general maintenance”) Mr\nDeadman and Mrs Barrett both confirmed that the reference in those\naccounts to “Schedule 4” was to Schedule 1 of the Lease.\n65. The Tribunal found this part of the evidence tendered by the First\nRespondent to be deeply unsatisfactory. There were no notes or\nexplanations in the accounts or in the letters to the lessees explaining\nwhy the reference to Schedules in the account of the letter to lessees\ndiffered from the Schedules to the Lease. Mr Deadman was unable to\npoint to any confirmation or independent support for his\nunderstanding of the references to the schedules, apart from what he\nsaid he had been told by the accountants and what he said had been\nhistorical way of preparing the accounts. This is not necessarily a\ncriticism of Mr Deadman or of the First Respondent, as the Tribunal\ndoes not know what (if any) advice the First Respondent had received\nfrom the managing agents or the accountants about presentation of the\naccounts.\n66. The poor quality of this evidence does however mean that the Tribunal\nwas not satisfied how or on what basis conservatory repair cost\nincurred in 2016/2017 were allocated apparently to service charge\nunder the First Schedule to the Lease.\n67. The Board meetings of the First Respondent in the Bundle at pages 220\n- 234 provided no further detail as to how the decision to allocate cost\nor to carry out the works to 1 Budgenor Lodge was made.\n68. Ultimately the Tribunal cannot be satisfied on the available evidence\nthat a decision was made to carry out the works to the conservatory\nroofs of 1 Budgenor Lodge for the purposes set out in paragraphs 7 or\n10 of the First Schedule to the Lease. There was simply no evidence to\nsupport such a conclusion. Mr Deadman was unable to provide any\nfurther clarification about this and the documents produced did not\nconfirm the reasoning for the decision.\n69. Mr Deadman explained that the service charge demands at pages 252 –\n262 of the Bundle had been based upon an apportionment of\nconservatory costs between the various conservatory owners at 1\nBudgenor Lodge. The service charge demand for 1 Budgenor Lodge at\npage 252 was £1788.30 presumably based upon a percentage of costs\nincurred for such works in the service charge year ending 31 01 2017.\nMr Deadman explained that the demands included in the bundle were\nincomplete and there was another page to each demand. Directions had\nbeen given as long ago as the Interim Decision of 24 May 2018 for\n16\n\nproduction of the demands and the Tribunal was concerned that full\ncopies had not been provided. On the available evidence, no\njustification under the Lease was advanced for the apportionments of\nthose costs as service charges solely between the conservatory owners.\n70. In the absence of such a justification or satisfactory explanation, the\nTribunal cannot find that the sums claimed from the Applicant in the\ninvoice at page 252 is payable as a service charge. It is unclear whether\nthe invoices for conservatory works at pages 206- 214 have been\nincluded within the service charge accounts for 2016/2017. Even if\nthey have been so included, the Tribunal has not been provided with a\ndemand which might justify their payability as service charges under\nSchedule 1 of the Lease.\n71. The Tribunal is also asked to determine whether costs incurred for\nconservatory works in the 2017/2018 service charge year are payable as\nservice charge. It appears from the 2017/2018 service charge draft\naccounts that a total of £831.66 has been incurred for such works for\nthat service charge year. The Tribunal has not been provided with any\nservice charge demands for those works and or invoices in respect of\nthose works. On the basis of that evidence available the Tribunal\nconcludes that none of the works to conservatories in 2017/2018 are\npayable as service charge by any of the parties to these proceedings.\n72. None of the above conclusions affect or are intended to affect the\npayability of service charge demands which include costs of cleaning\nthe external glazed surfaces of the conservatories or other services\nwhich are addressed by the Fifth Schedule to the Lease. That issue is\nnot before the Tribunal in this application.\nConclusion\n73. The costs incurred for repairs to conservatory roofs at Budgenor Lodge\nin the service charge years 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 are not payable\nas service charges under the Leases of Budgenor Lodge on the evidence\npresented to the Tribunal.\n74. The £1788.30 claimed as service charges in a written demand\naddressed to Mrs and Mrs Cooper as lessees of 1 Budgenor Lodge dated\n31 10 2017 is not payable as a service charge under the terms of their\nLease.\nName: Tribunal Judge H Lederman\nDate: 25th February 2019\n17\n\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1.

The form of remote hearing was P:PAPER REMOTE. The\nDirections provided for the application to be determined on the papers\nunless any party requested a hearing. No party has requested a hearing.\nThe Applicant has provided a Bundle of Documents of 56 pages.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nIntroduction\n1. The Applicant tenant has sought a lease extension pursuant to the\nLeasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (“the Act”).\nThe current application by the tenant is for the determination of the costs\npayable by the tenants under section 60(1) of the Act. The landlord seeks\ncosts in the sum of £2,979 (inc VAT), namely (i) Legal Fees: £1,565 + VAT;\n(ii) Valuation Fees: £900 + VAT; and (iii) Land Registry fees: £21.\n2. On 2o July 2022, the Tribunal issued its standard Directions. Pursuant to\nthese, the Applicant has provided a Schedule of Costs (at p.50). The\nApplicant is also claiming £900 + VAT for Valuation Fees. It seems that\nthis is a fixed fee charged by Bureau Property Consultants. The invoice,\ndated 2 December 2021, is at p.51. Finally, Land Registry fees of £21 are\nclaimed. The Applicant was asked to identify any unusual por complex\nfeatures to the case. No such features have been identified.\n3. The Applicant has provided his submissions on costs (at p.2-43). He\nexhibits four FTT decisions. He suggests that the following sums should be\npayable: (i) valuation fees of £400 + VAT and (ii) legal fees of £1,194 +\nVAT. He notes that Bureau Property Consultants conducted a desk based\nvaluation. The Applicant obtained an estimate from Bradley Harris Ltd who\nquoted £400 (exc VAT) for a desktop survey and £700 (+ VAT) were an\ninspection to be required (see p.16). He suggests that the solicitors spent an\nexcessive amount of time on \"obtaining advice and title docs\" – 1.5 hours\nshould be reduced by 50%. The new lease was based on the extended lease\nfor Flat 28. He complains about the £41 claimed for \"arrangement for\nmanagement company to sign the counterpart lease\". He had arranged for\nthe Management Company to sign the new lease.\n4. The Respondent's submissions on costs are at p.48-51. Knights are based in\nChester. The solicitor conducted the enfranchisement charged £200 ph\nincreasing to £220. He qualified in 2019. He was assisted by a legal\nexecutive who charged £170 ph increasing to £205. These rates are not\nunreasonable for National 2 Fee Earners.\n5. This was a straight forward lease extension. On 22 November 2021, the\ntenant served his Section 42 Notice proposing a premium of £7,500. On 13\nJanuary 2022, the landlord served a Counter Notice proposing a premium\nof £14,365. The parties agreed a premium of £11,000. There had been other\nlease extensions in the block in respect of which the landlord's valuer had\nacted. The lease was based on that used for Flat 28. The legal executive was\nresponsible for preparing and agreeing the draft lease.\nThe Statutory Provisions\n6. Section 60 provides, insofar as relevant for the purposes of this decision:\n“(1) Where a notice is given under section 42, then (subject to the\nprovisions of this section) the tenant by whom it is given shall be\n2\n\nliable, to the extent that they have been incurred by any relevant\nperson in pursuance of the notice, for the reasonable costs of and\nincidental to any of the following matters, namely—\n(a) any investigation reasonably undertaken of the tenant's\nright to a new lease;\n(b) any valuation of the tenant's flat obtained for the purpose of\nfixing the premium or any other amount payable by virtue of\nSchedule 13 in connection with the grant of a new lease under\nsection 56;\n(c) the grant of a new lease under that section;\nbut this subsection shall not apply to any costs if on a sale made\nvoluntarily a stipulation that they were to be borne by the purchaser\nwould be void.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) any costs incurred by a\nrelevant person in respect of professional services rendered by any\nperson shall only be regarded as reasonable if and to the extent that\ncosts in respect of such services might reasonably be expected to\nhave been incurred by him if the circumstances had been such that\nhe was personally liable for all such costs.\n........\n(5) A tenant shall not be liable under this section for any costs which\na party to any proceedings under this Chapter before a leasehold\nvaluation tribunal incurs in connection with the proceedings.\n(6) In this section “relevant person”, in relation to a claim by a\ntenant under this Chapter, means the landlord for the purposes of\nthis Chapter… or any third party to the tenant's lease.”\nThe Principles\n7. In Metropolitan Property Realisations v Moss [2013] UKUT 415, Martin\nRodger QC, the Deputy President, gave the following guidance on the\napproach to be adopted:\n“9. These provisions are straightforward and their purpose is readily\nunderstandable. Part I of the 1993 Act is expropriatory, in that it\nconfers valuable rights on tenants of leasehold flats to compel their\nlandlords to grant new interests in those premises whether they are\nwilling to do so or not. It is a matter of basic fairness, necessary to\navoid the statute from becoming penal, that the tenant exercising\nthose statutory rights should reimburse the costs necessarily\nincurred by any person in receipt of such a claim in satisfying\nthemselves that the claim is properly made, in obtaining advice on\nthe sum payable by the tenant in consideration for the new interest\nand in completing the formal steps necessary to create it.\n3\n\n10. On the other hand, the statute is not intended to provide an\nopportunity for the professional advisers of landlords to charge\nexcessive fees, nor are tenants expected to pay landlords' costs of\nresolving disputes over the terms of acquisition of new leases. Thus\nthe sums payable by a tenant under section 60 are restricted to those\nincurred by the landlord within the three categories identified\nin section 60(1) and are further restricted by the requirement that\nonly reasonable costs are payable. Section 60(2) provides a ceiling\nby reference to the reasonable expectations of a person paying the\ncosts from their own pocket; the costs of work which would not have\nbeen incurred, or which would have been carried out more cheaply,\nif the landlord was personally liable to meet them are not reasonable\ncosts which the tenant is required to pay.\n11. Section 60 therefore provides protection for both landlords and\ntenants: for landlords against being out of pocket when compelled to\ngrant new interests under the Act, and for tenants against being\nrequired to pay more than is reasonable.”\nThe Tribunal’s Determination\nLegal Fees - Sum Claimed: £1,565 (+ VAT)\n8. A Schedule of Costs has been provided. We are satisfied that the hourly\nrates are reasonable. We do not consider that an excessive amount of time\nwas spent on investigating the Applicants right to a new lease or on the\nother work connected to the enfranchisement. The sums claimed are not\nunreasonable for a straight forward lease extension of this nature.\nValuation Fees – Sums Claimed: £900 (+ VAT)\n9. The Tribunal is satisfied that the valuer's fees are excessive for a desktop\nvaluation for a straight forward lease extension of this nature. The Tribunal\nhas regard to the estimate obtained by the Applicant. The Tribunal assesses\nvaluation fees in the sum of £500 (+ VAT).\n10. The Tribunal sees no reason to disallow the Land Registry fee of £21.\nJudge Robert Latham,\n12 October 2022\n4\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of appeal\nthey may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber),\nthen a written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal\nat the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within\n28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person\nmaking the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with\nthe 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide\nwhether to allow the application for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not\nbeing within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the tribunal\nto which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number), state the\ngrounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n5"

On 15th August 2018, the Applicant (tenant of the above property) referred to the\nTribunal, a notice of increase of rent served by the Respondent (landlord of the\nabove property) under section 13 of the Housing Act 1988.\n2. The Respondent’s notice, which proposed a rent of £624.00 per month with effect\nfrom 23rd August 2018, is dated 5th July 2018.\n3. The date the tenancy commenced is stated on the Application Form as being on 23rd\nDecember 2015 and is an Assured Tenancy. The current rent is stated in the\nRespondent’s notice as being £550.00 per month.\n4. The Tribunal issued its Decision following the inspection and hearing on 18th\nOctober 2018. The Respondent subsequently requested written reasons and these\ndetailed reasons are provided in response to that request.\nINSPECTION\n5. The Tribunal inspected the property on Thursday 18th October 2018 in the presence\nof the Applicant and the Applicant’s Representatives. The Respondent did not\nattend the inspection.\n6. The property comprises of a small end terraced house situated in an established\nurban area.\n7. Briefly the accommodation comprises front living room and rear dining/kitchen\nwith rear porch off. The kitchen is fitted with basic base and wall cupboards\nincorporating an inset stainless steel sink unit.\n8. On the first floor there is a small landing which leads to one double bedroom, one\nsingle bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom is fitted with a panelled bath, separate\nshower cubicle, wash hand basin and low flush W.C.\n9. The house has gas fired central heating provided by the wall mounted boiler in the\nkitchen.\n10. To the front of the property is a garden with vehicle parking space and to the rear a\nprivate garden. There is no garage or garage space.\n11. The property was found to be in generally poor condition throughout and in\nparticular the Applicant pointed out several items which were noted by the\nTribunal:\nI. There was no banister rail.\nII. There was no window furniture to the left side opening window in bedroom 1.\nIII. There was evidence of the radiator leaking in bedroom 2. This has\nnecessitated the electrics having to be moved.\nIV. The loft hatch in bedroom 2 required attention.\nV. The light switch in bedroom 2 was broken.\nVI. The light ceiling rose in bedroom 2 was broken.\nVII. The shower had leaked into the kitchen below and there was damp to the\nstaircase wall behind the shower cubicle.\n2\n\nVIII. The light over the stairs does not work (the Applicant informed the Tribunal\nthat the bulb kept blowing).\nIX. Foam had been put around the rear porch/house area to help prevent the\ningress of rats.\nX. There was a glass window at the bottom of the stairs which was not safety\nglass.\nXI. There was evidence of leaking above the lounge window.\nXII. There was evidence of temporary repairs to the front door and frame.\nXIII. There had been leaking from the roof above the lounge. The Tribunal noted\nwhat could only be described as a temporary repair in this area externally.\nXIV. The floor to the lounge and kitchen was uneven.\nXV. The pipework below the boiler in the kitchen was untidy and had not been\nboxed in meaning that hot pipework was not shielded.\nXVI. The light rose to the dining area ceiling light was hanging off.\nEVIDENCE\n12. The Tribunal received written representations from both parties which were copied\nto the other party.\n13. A hearing was arranged at the Tribunal Office which was attended by the\nApplicant’s Representatives and the Respondent.\nTHE HEARING\n14. On behalf of the Applicant Miss Weaver submitted:\n1) That the Applicant was of the opinion that there was no justification for any\nincrease in rental as the Applicant had made cosmetic improvements to the\nproperty since March.\n2) That there were exposed electrics and when the gas hob was used it left a\nburn mark on the wall.\n3) That there were issues of safety such as the lack of a stair rail and lack of\nsafety glass at the bottom of the stairs.\n4) That the delays in works being undertaken were not all the Applicant’s\nresponsibility.\n5) That the shower leaked into the kitchen.\n15. The Applicant further submitted that some repair works were carried out during the\nevening prior to the Tribunal’s inspection after a considerable delay. It was also\nconfirmed that the property was occupied by the Applicant and her son although\nmany family members also visited.\n16. It was further submitted that the Applicant felt unsafe in the area and that there had\nbeen issues with the security of the door locks.\n17. The Tribunal asked if the Applicant had any comparable evidence regarding rents in\nthe area and although no evidence was submitted it was confirmed that the\nApplicant was of the opinion that there was no justification for an increase in rental.\n18. The Respondent submitted:\n1) That at the commencement of the tenancy the rent was agreed at £625.00\nper calendar month. This subsequently reduced to £550.00 per calendar\nmonth so had remained at this level for some 3 years.\n3\n\n2) That £495.00 was paid by the Local Authority with the remainder being the\nresponsibility of the Applicant. As only one payment had been made by the\nApplicant there were considerable arrears.\n3) That he has been informed by the Local Authority that rents in this area for\nproperties of this type were in the region of £625.00 - £650.00 per calendar\nmonth.\n4) That as the rent was fixed some three years ago he was only proposing a\nrental increase to the original rental agreed.\n5) That it was the Applicant’s responsibility to look after the garden. The\nAlleyway at the side of the property was not part of the garden although the\nRespondent had offered to pay towards getting it cleared.\n6) That repairs required should be referred to the Respondent in the first\ninstance.\n7) That the Applicant had breached the Tenancy Agreement in that she had kept\na dog at the property and had carried out alterations which resulted in a gas\npipe being broken.\n8) That the property was let unfurnished so it was not the Respondent’s\nresponsibility if the Applicant chose to purchase a large refrigerator which\nresulted in the gas cooker being moved to an unsafe position in the kitchen.\n9) That the property had suitable locks when it was let and the Applicant was\nunable to provide Police Incident Numbers for the alleged attempted break-\nins.\nTHE LAW\n19. In accordance with the terms of section 14 Housing Act 1988 the Tribunal\nproceeded to determine the rent at which it considered that the subject property\nmight reasonably be expected to be let on the open market by a willing landlord\nunder an assured tenancy.\n20. In so doing the Tribunal, as required by section 14(1), ignored the effect on the\nrental value of the property of any relevant tenant's improvements as defined in\nsection 14(2) of that Act.\nTHE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION\n21. The Tribunal noted that the property was in poor general condition throughout and\nthat although it was not well occupied, there were numerous areas of repair which\nwere required.\n22. In coming to its decision, the Tribunal had regard to the members' own general\nknowledge of market rent levels in the area of Birmingham.\n23. The Tribunal concluded that if it was in good condition as is expected for a modern\nAssured Shorthold Tenancy an appropriate market rent for the property would be\n£680.00 per calendar month.\n24. However, the property was not in the condition that would be expected for an\nAssured Shorthold Tenancy in the current market and The Tribunal therefore\ndetermined that the following deductions were appropriate:\n4\n\nNo Double Glazing 40.00\nNo White Goods 20.00\nLeaking Radiator 5.00\nRepairs to electrics 15.00\nLeaking Shower 10.00\nUneven Floors 5.00\nLack of banister rail 8.00\nMissing Window Furniture 2.00\nTotal £105.00\n25. This leaves a Market Rent of £575.00 per calendar month.\n26. The Tribunal therefore determined a Market Rent of £575.00 per calendar month.\n27. This rent will take effect from 23rd August 2018, being the date of the Respondent’s\nNotice.\nAPPEAL\n28. Any appeal against this Decision can only be made on a point of law and must be\nmade to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber). Prior to making such an appeal the\nparty appealing must apply, in writing, to this Tribunal for permission to appeal\nwithin 28 days of the date of issue of this Decision, (or, if applicable, within 28 days\nof any decision on a review or application to set aside) identifying the decision to\nwhich the appeal relates, stating the grounds on which that party intends to rely in\nthe appeal, and stating the result sought by the party making the application.\nG S Freckelton FRICS\nChairman\nFirst-tier Tribunal Property Chamber (Residential Property)\n5"

The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR27"

A face-to-face hearing was not held because it was not practicable and no\none requested same.\nThe documents the Tribunal were referred to were in a bundle of some 167 pages.\nSummary of the tribunal’s decision\n(1) The appropriate premium payable for the collective\nenfranchisement is £123,000. (One hundred and twenty-three\nthousand pounds.)\nBackground\n1. This is an application made by the applicant qualifying tenants pursuant to\nsection 26 and 27 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Act 1993 (“the Act”) for a determination of the premium to\nbe paid for the collective enfranchisement of 94 Elgin Road, Ilford IG3\n8LW. (the “property”) where the Landlord cannot be found.\nThe issues\n2. In the absence of the Landlord there are no matters agreed. The applicants\nhave submitted a valuation report prepared by Colin Horton of Hortons.\n(a) The subject property is a Victorian building over two floors, subsequently\nconverted into four self-contained flats. Construction is traditional brick\nelevation.\nThe accommodation comprises;\n94a, ground floor flat one double bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom\nWC.\n94d ground floor, one single bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom.\n94 b, first floor one single bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom WC.\n94 C first floor, one double bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and living room.\n\nOutside there is a communal garden.\n(b) The valuation date is 26th October 2021.\n(c) Details of the tenants’ leasehold interests:\nFlat A, B, C, and D are on the same terms, 99 years from 25th December 1980 rent\n£100 pa rising by £50 each 21 years with final 15 years of £250 pa payable.\nThe tribunal regards these matters as uncontroversial and they are supported by\ndocuments in the bundle. The tribunal will consider the evidence on the following\nmatters:\n(d) Capitalisation of ground rent:\n(e) Deferment rate:\n(f) Freehold value\n(g) Relativity\n(h) Development hope value.\n(i) Appurtenant Land\n(j) The premium payable.\nThe hearing\n5. The case was dealt with on the papers on 6th April 2022 with the necessary\ndocuments provided in a bundle by the Applicant’s representative.\n6. The tribunal was not asked to inspect the property and the tribunal did not\nconsider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection to make its determination.\n7. The applicant relied upon the expert report and valuation of Colin Horton of\nHortons dated 26th October 2021.\nCapitalisation rate\n\n8. Colin Horton considers that capitalisation rates 7.0% are normal. The rent is\nmodest and reviews are at 21 years apart.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n9. The tribunal determines that the rate to be used is 7.0%.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n10. The tribunal notes that a rate of 7.0% has been used in Colin Horton’s\nexperience and in the absence of any specific evidence to show that this should be\nvaried in this case the tribunal will adopt this rate.\nDeferment rate\n11. Colin Horton applies the Sportelli rate of 5%\nThe tribunal’s determination\n12. The tribunal determines that 5% is appropriate as the deferment rate.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n13. The tribunal sees no reason to depart from the Sportelli rate.\nFreehold value\n14. Colin Horton values the freehold interest of each flat at £200,000.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n15. The tribunal determines that the reversionary value is supported by the\nevidence, notwithstanding that, no distinguishment is made between flats for\neither floor level or whether they offer a one single bedroom or a double the\nevidence supports an average of £200,000 per flat.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n16. The comparable evidence represented in the report supports these figures.\nRelativity\n\n17. Colin Horton uses Savills unenfranchisement , Zucconi and Gerald Eve graphs\nto determine a relativity figure of 75.6%.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n18. The graphs form solid evidence and the relativity is accepted.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n19. The graphs are widely accepted as a robust approach for determining the\nrelativity.\nDevelopment hope value\n20. The tribunal determines that there is no development hope value to be\nincluded in the calculation.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n21. The property is fully utilised by the subject flat and there is no development\npotential.\nAppurtenant land\n22. Nil is added for appurtenant land.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n23. This is accepted by the tribunal.\nThe premium\n24. The tribunal determines the appropriate premium to be £123,000.00\n25.

The Tribunal determines to exercise its discretion to dispense with the\nconsultation requirements provided by Section 20 of the Landlord and\nTenant Act 1985.\nThe Application\n2. Grace Miller and Co applied on behalf of the Applicant on 6 February 2025\nunder Section 20ZA of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (the Act), for\ndispensation from the consultation requirements provided for by Section\n20 of the Act.\n3. The application indicated that the subject of the dispensation application\nwas in relation to excavation and replacement of drainage pipework and\nits reconnection to the main system at the Property.\n4. The application explained that the reason that dispensation was sought\nwas because the non-functional drainage pipework was causing flooding,\nunpleasant odours and the risk of the system backing up into the flats.\nThis meant investigation, excavation and replacement had to be started as\nsoon as possible.\nProcedure\n5. The Tribunal issued directions on 6 June 2025. Following the receipt of\nan Order No 1 form from the Applicant, revised directions were issued on\n23 June 2025 with an amended timetable.\n6. In those directions the Tribunal set out that the matter would be\ndetermined on the basis of the papers provided.\n7. The directions gave an opportunity for the Respondents to request a\nhearing. No hearing was requested so the matter has proceeded based on\nthe papers provided for the Tribunal.\n8. The directions also provided an opportunity for the Respondents to\nprovide a statement objecting to the application. No responses were\nreceived by the Tribunal.\n9. The Tribunal has considered the written bundle of 47 pages, in support of\nthe Application.\n2\n\nDetermination\nThe Background\n10. The property is a standalone block of flats with 24 units. The Applicant is\nthe Residents Management Company.\n11. The evidence and submissions of the Applicant is as follows:\ni. The application is for an unconditional dispensation of the\nconsultation requirements prescribed under Section 20 of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 in relation to works to investigate a\nblockage in the drainage system, excavate and replace shattered\npipework. The extent of the work required council licences and a\ntraffic management plan. A tanker was also required to manage the\nproblem until the pipework was replaced.\nii. A quotation of £31,414.90 (£26,179.08 +VAT) from Unbloc for\nexcavation, new connection and licensing.\niii. An estimate of tanker costs of £6,000.\niv. Lining and clearing works confirmed to be instructed at £8,791.\nv. The works are subject to an insurance claim and whilst the insurer\nhas confirmed they will pay some of the costs, it is yet to be\ndetermined the full amount to be covered by the insurer.\nvi. A letter sent to all Leaseholders to advise of the works required and\nassociated costs. The letter outlines why a Section 20 consultation\nwas not considered possible and confirms an application for\ndispensation will be made to the Tribunal. A meeting was offered to\naddress any concerns.\n12. In accordance with Tribunal directions, the Applicant notified\nleaseholders of the S20ZA application, including how to respond. No\nresponses from leaseholders were received by the Tribunal or Applicant.\nThe Law\n13. The Tribunal is being asked to exercise its discretion under Section 20ZA\nof the Act. The wording of Section 20ZA, subsection (1) provides:\n‘Where an application is made to a leasehold valuation tribunal for\ndetermination to dispense with all or any of the consultation requirements\nin relation to any qualifying works or qualifying long term agreements, the\n3\n\ntribunal may make the determination if satisfied that it is reasonable\nto dispense with the requirements’.\n14. The Supreme Court in the case of Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson\n[2013] UKSC 14 (Daejan) is the leading authority on how the statutory\nprovisions are to be interpreted.\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n15. The Tribunal determines to grant the application.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n16. The statement from the Applicant explains the reasons the works needed\nto be actioned quickly without the time afforded by a full Section 20\nconsultation.\n17. No objections were received from leaseholders.\n18. The Tribunal therefore determines that it is reasonable to grant the\napplication sought.\n19. Both parties should note that this determination does not\nconcern the issue of whether the service charge costs demanded\nin connection with the works to the drainage system are\nreasonable or indeed payable. The Respondents are able, if it\nappears to them to be appropriate, to make an application\nunder Section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 as to\nreasonableness and payability.\nName: S Beckwith MRICS Date: 4 September 2025\n4\n\nRights of Appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number),\nstate the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the application\nis seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n5"

      "text": "FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL\nPROPERTY CHAMBER\n(RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY)\nCase Reference : CHI/24UJ/RTB/2022/0002\nProperty : 39 Shrubbs Avenue\nLymington, Hampshire S041 9DJ\nApplicant : Mrs Q J Dawson\nRepresentative :\nRespondent : New Forest District Council\nRepresentative :\nType of Application : Refusal of Right to Buy\nParagraph 11 of Schedule 5 of the Housing\nAct 1985 (as amended) (“the Act”).\nTribunal Member : Judge Tildesley OBE\nVenue and Date of : Decision on the Papers\nHearing\nDate of Decision : 12 February 2023\nDECISION\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n\nSummary of Decision\nThe Tribunal, therefore, refuses the Appeal and confirms the\nCouncil’s decision that the exception to the right to buy as set out\nin paragraph 5 of schedule 11 of the Housing Act 1985 applies to\nthis property.\nBackground\n1. On 2 December 2022 the Tribunal received an appeal from the\nApplicant against the denial of the right to buy 39 Shrubbs Avenue\nLymington Hampshire S041 9DJ.\n2. The denial, dated 2 November 2022, was issued by the New Forest\nDistrict Council (“the Council”), on the ground that the property is\nparticularly suitable for occupation by elderly people (under paragraph\n11 of Schedule 5 to the Housing Act 1985).\n3. On 3 January 2023 the Tribunal directed that the application would be\nheard on the papers without a hearing unless a party objected in writing\nwithin 28 days of the directions. No objection has been received.\n4. The Directions also required the parties to exchange their statements of\ncases and for the Council to supply a hearing bundle which it did on the\n7 February 2023.\n5. The Tribunal indicated that it would not inspect the property but that if\nthe condition of the property was salient to the issues the parties had\npermission to include photographs. None were received and there has\nbeen no request for the Tribunal to make an external inspection.\n6. The Tribunal had before it a witness statement of Mr Dan Lacey dated\n23 January 2023 and the Applicant’s statement dated 15 January 2023.\nMr Lacey is the Tenant Account Manager for the Council.\nThe Issue\n7. The Application is based on the Council’s decision to deny the\nApplicant the right to buy the Property on the grounds in paragraph 11\nof Schedule 5 to the Housing Act 1985. The Applicant requires the\nTribunal to determine whether the exception from the right to buy for\noccupation by elderly persons applies to the Property.\n8. Under paragraph 11 of schedule 5 to the Housing Act 1985 the Right to\nBuy does not arise if the property:\na) is particularly suitable for occupation by elderly persons, taking into\naccount its location, size, design, heating system and other features,\nand\n2\n\nb) was let for occupation by a person aged 60 or over, whether they were\nthe tenant or not; and\nc) was first let on a tenancy before 1 January 1990.\n9. The Department for Communities and Local Government has issued\nGuidance on “Your Right to Buy Your Home” in July 2014 (“The\nGuidance”) which replaced the previous guidance of The Office of the\nDeputy Prime Minister (ODPM) 7/2004 (Right to Buy: Exclusion of\nElderly Persons Housing). The Guidance sets out the main criteria to\nbe taken onto account in determining the particular suitability of an\nindividual dwelling house for occupation by elderly persons. The\nTribunal is not bound by the Guidance but can have regard to it when\nconsidering such an application.\n10. The Guidance at page 22 identifies the following factors that the\ndecision-maker will normally expect to be satisfied when applying the\nexception to the Right to Buy:\na) There should be easy access on foot to your home: access is unlikely\nto be regarded as easy if it is necessary to climb three or more steps (in\naddition to the threshold) and there is no handrail.\nb) The accommodation should normally be on one level.\nc) In the case of a flat above ground floor level there should be easy\naccess by lift.\nd) There should be no more than two bedrooms.\ne) There should be heating arrangements which function reliably and\nprovide heat to at least the living room and one bedroom.\nf) Your home should be located reasonably conveniently for shops and\npublic transport, having regard to the nature of the area.\nThe Facts\n11. The Tribunal finds the following facts from the witness statement of Mr\nLacey, and exhibits which were not disputed by the Applicant.\na) On 3rd September 2018, 39 Shrubbs Avenue, Lymington was let\nto the Applicant, Mrs Quonah Dawson (nee Foster), aged 46,\nthrough a Mutual Exchange. The property had been previously\nlet to a tenant aged 66 at tenancy commencement.\nb) The property had been let from at least 23 April 1987.\nc) The property is a one-bedroom semi-detached bungalow\nconstructed in 1936 and all on one level. Access is at the front of\nthe property via a shrub free concrete path approximately three\nmeters long with a slight decline for the first metre. There is one\nconcrete step up to the front door which is 22cm deep. There are\nno handrails either along the path or by the front door. The\nheating at the property is gas fired central heating with radiators\nto all rooms.\n3\n\nd) The property is located near to local shops. The nearest shopping\narea centres around Lymington High Street. The route to this\narea involves crossing the B3054 Avenue Road which can, at\ntimes, be busy. Visibility to the left is limited by a rise in the road\nbut there is an island in the road to assist crossing. The\npavements on the route vary from good to uneven with some\nsmall slopes. The local shopping area includes Tesco Express\n(open 7am to 10pm Monday to Saturday, 10am to 4pm Sunday)\nM&S Simply Food, Boots and Superdrug chemists, two banks\nand a Building Society, WHSmith newsagents, a Post Office and\nnumerous clothes shops, cafes, pubs and bakeries. There is also a\nmarket on Saturdays. Tesco Express is located 804 metres /0.5\nmiles from the property. Lymington High Street, with the above\nfacilities, is 483 metres /0.3 miles long.\ne) There are bus stops near to the property. The Sports Ground\nstop is on the A337, Southampton Road and there is also the\nMain Post Office stop on the High Street. Both stops, measured\non Google Maps, are 804 metres / 0.5 miles from the property.\nf) There are a few bus routes available. Bluestar six runs hourly to\nand from Southampton Monday to Saturday and every two\nhours on Sunday. The route is via Totton Shopping Precinct and\nTrain Station, Southampton Central Station, Southampton\nASDA and ending at Westquay. More Bus 119 runs hourly to and\nfrom New Milton Monday to Saturday until early afternoon.\nThere is no Sunday service. This route is via Pennington and\nHordle. More Bus X1 & X2 runs every 30 minutes to and from\nBournemouth Monday to Saturday with a reduced service on\nSunday. The route is via New Milton, Highcliffe, Christchurch\nand Bournemouth Hospital.\ng) The nearest train station, Lymington Town, is 965 metres / 0.6\nmiles from the property. It provides eastbound service to\nBrockenhurst, Southampton, Basingstoke, London Waterloo, or\nWestbound service to Christchurch High Street, Bournemouth,\nPoole or Weymouth.\nConsideration\n12. The question for the Tribunal is whether the exception to right to buy as\nset out in paragraph 5 of Schedule 11 of the Housing Act 1985 should\napply to this property.\n13. Paragraph 5 of Schedule 11 of the Housing Act 1985 enables the Council\nto refuse an application for right to buy in the case of a property that is\nparticularly suitable for persons aged 60 or over provided the property\nwas first let before 1 January 1990 and had been occupied by a tenant\nwho was 60 and over.\n4\n\n14. The facts found demonstrate that the property was first let before 1\nJanuary 1990 and that the previous tenant had been aged 66 when a\ntenancy of the property was first let to him.\n15. The question of whether a property is particularly suitable for persons\nover 60 is dependant on the facts. In this case the facts found were that\nit is a one bedroom bungalow on one level with gas central heating and\neasy access on foot, and conveniently located to shops and public\ntransport. The Tribunal is satisfied that property meets the description\nof a property particularly suitable for persons over 60.\n16. The Applicant acknowledged that the property is suitable for an elderly\nperson, and did not dispute the facts found by the Tribunal. The\nApplicant’s grievance was that when she agreed to a mutual exchange of\nthe tenancy of this property for her former tenancy she was told that\nthere were no restrictions on her right to buy. The Applicant pointed\nout that at the time of the mutual exchange she was a secure tenant\nwith a protected discount if she exercised her right to buy. The\nApplicant asserted that if she had been aware of the possibility of such a\nrefusal she would not have moved and if the refusal was not overturned\nshe would have to move again.\n17. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to deciding whether the three\nrequirements of paragraph 5 of schedule 11 of the Housing Act 1985 are\nmet. In this case the Tribunal has found that the property fulfils the\nthree requirements of a property particularly suitable for elderly\npersons, that it was first let before the 1 January 1990 and that a\nprevious tenant was over 60 when it was first let to him. The fact that\nthe Applicant may have been misled about her right to buy when she\nagreed to exchange the tenancy of her former property for the tenancy\nof this property is not a matter that the Tribunal can take account of\nwhen deciding whether the exception of properties particularly suitable\nfor elderly persons should apply to this property.\nDecision\n18. The Tribunal, therefore, refuses the Appeal and confirms the\nCouncil’s decision that the exception to the right to buy as set\nout in paragraph 5 of schedule 11 of the Housing Act 1985\napplies to this property.\n5\n\nRIGHTS OF APPEAL\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application\nby email to rpsouthern@justice.gov.uk to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nRegional office which has been dealing with the case.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the\nTribunal sends to the person making the application written reasons for\nthe decision.\n3. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28 day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to\nappeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide\nwhether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to\nappeal to proceed.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state\nthe result the party making the application is seeking.\n6"

This is an appeal under para 10 of Sch.13A to the Housing Act 2004 (“the\nAct”) against a decision by the Respondent to impose a financial penalty\nof £22,100. A Final Notice imposing the penalty was given to the Appel-\nlant on 20 June 2018. This alleged a failure to comply with an Improve-\nment Notice relating to 15A Ingleside Crescent, Lancing, West Sussex\nBN15 8EN.\n2. A hearing took place on 15 November 2018. The Appellant appeared in\nperson and the Respondent was represented by Ms S Lovegrove of coun-\nsel. The Tribunal inspected on 20 November 2018 and reconvened after\nthe inspection to determine the appeal.\nThe Premises\n3. 15 Ingleside Crescent is a bungalow c.1950 in a residential area, close to\nthe centre of Lancing. 15A Ingleside Crescent is the former garage for the\nbungalow which has been converted into self-contained residential ac-\ncommodation. On inspection, 15A was accessed from the street across\nalong a concrete driveway running along the flank of the main house and\nunder a timber framed car port roofed with corrugated plastic sheets.\nBetween the main house and 15A is a solid timber gate (“the side gate”)\ngiving access to a small enclosed area. The side gate can be operated in-\nternally by a thumb latch. On the left-hand side of this enclosed area is a\nraised area with a door to the kitchen of the house and a gate to the rear\nyard (“the garden gate”). On the right-hand side, at slightly lower level,\nis the main door to 15A (“the main door”). In the yard, towards the back\non the right-hand side adjacent to 15A is a raised plinth which is con-\nsistent with the position of the former “summer house” referred to be-\nlow. The right-hand edge of this plinth (now covered) is approximately\n300mm from a uPVC glazed window set into the left-hand flank wall of\n15A (“the bedroom window”).\n4. 15A itself is a brick-built structure with a felt covered flat roof. The Tri-\nbunal’s inspection suggested the external walls were solid brickwork and\nthere was no external evidence of any membrane or chemical-injection\ntype Damp Proof Course. The Tribunal did not inspect the roof, but the\nskylight and exterior suggested there was limited scope for a cavity or\ninsulation between the ceiling and roofing felt.\n5. Internally, the accommodation comprises:\n• A living room to the front, with a window onto the car port. The\nmain door is on the left-hand side of the living room. On the left-\nhand side there is also a small separate kitchen area with its own\nuPVC window looking onto the rear yard. Opposite the kitchen\narea on the right-hand wall is an enclosure with a small fridge. A\ndoor at the rear of the living room gives access to the bedroom.\nThe kitchen area is heated with a portable oil-filled electric heater\nand there is a wall-mounted electric extractor fan (which ap-\npeared to operate satisfactorily). There are mains-powered smoke\n\ndetectors which again appear to operate properly. The living room\nhas laminated flooring which is lifting in parts revealing that it is\nlaid directly on the concrete screed below.\n• A bedroom to the rear. This has a window to the rear, a skylight\nset into the ceiling and the bedroom window to the yard men-\ntioned above. Although the bedroom window was behind a bed on\nthe day of inspection, the Tribunal was shown that it opened out-\nwards and was secured with a lockable handle. There were again\nmains-powered smoke detectors.\n• On the left-hand side of the bedroom is a small shower room with\nits own uPVC window onto the yard. The room has a shower en-\nclosure, WC and wash handbasin. It is heated with an electric wall\nmounted fan heater and there is another wall mounted electric\nextractor fan. Both appear to work satisfactorily.\nThe rear yard is rather cluttered, with seating and tables. The Tribunal\nwas shown some minor storm damage to felt attached to the kitchen roof\nof the bungalow. Power to 15A is connected to an RDL M100 single tariff\ncoin-operated meter.\n6. However, it is also necessary to set out a brief history of the premises.\nThe Appellant has been the registered proprietor of 15 Ingleside Crescent\nsince April 1994. At least 15 years ago, the Appellant converted the gar-\nage into a residential unit and applied the street address of 15A to this\nproperty. At some stage before 2016, the Appellant constructed a timber\nframed and clad single storey outbuilding in the yard which has been\ndescribed as a “summer house”. It was built in the position described\nabove, close to the left-hand flank wall of 15A. At that stage, the wall of\nthe summer house facing 15A Ingleside Crescent was uninterrupted, and\nit was built so close to the flank wall of 15A that the bedroom window\ncould not open outwards fully. There was no access on foot from the bed-\nroom of 15A into the yard, except by a circuitous route leading through\nthe living room and main door of 15A, then through the covered area and\ngarden gate into the yard.\nThe Law\n7. The matter under appeal is a financial penalty imposed on a person un-\nder s.249A of the Act for failing to comply with an Improvement Notice.\nThat penalty is an alternative to prosecution for an offence under s.30(1)\nof the Act. If no appeal is brought against the Improvement Notice,\ns.30(2)(a) of the Act provides that “compliance with an improvement no-\ntice means, in relation to each hazard, beginning and completing any re-\nmedial action specified in the notice … not later than the date specified\nunder section 13(2)(e) and within the period specified under section\n13(2)(f)”. The amount of the penalty must not be more than £30,000:\nsee s.249A(4) of the Act. Prior to imposing the financial penalty, the local\nhousing authority must give an initial Notice of Intent and a Final Notice.\nSch.13A to the Act contains the requirements for these notices.\n8. In any proceedings, it is a defence that the person had a “reasonable ex-\ncuse for failing to comply with the” Final Notice: see s.30(4) of the Act\n\nIn this respect, there is a material decision of the High Court in Haringey\nLBC v Goremsandhu [2013] EWHC 3834 (Admin). The Tribunal will re-\nturn to this case below.\n9. The person on whom the penalty is imposed may appeal to the Tribunal.\nAn appeal is by way of re-hearing: see para 10(3) of Sch.13A. The Tribu-\nnal can confirm, vary or cancel the Final Notice. The same criminal\nstandard of proof is required for a civil penalty as for a prosecution – and\nthis is the standard which the Tribunal must apply on appeal. On appeal,\nthe Respondent must therefore be able to demonstrate beyond reasona-\nble doubt that the Appellant has committed an offence under s.30(1) of\nthe Act.\n10. As to the level of any financial penalty, para 10(12) of Sch.13A of the Act\nprovides that a local housing authority must have regard to any guidance\ngiven by the Secretary of State about the exercise of its functions under\nthe Schedule or s.249A. The relevant guidance is contained in Guidance\nfor Local Authorities: Civil Penalties under the Housing and Planning\nAct 2016 (April 2018) made under this provision (“the Guidance”). In\nparticular, para 3.5 of the Guidance sets out a list of factors to be taken\ninto account when assessing the level, of penalty:\n• Severity of the offence.\n• Culpability and track record of the offender.\n• The harm caused to the tenant.\n• Punishment of the offender.\n• Deter the offender from repeating the offence.\n• Deter others form committing similar offences.\n• Remove any financial benefit the offender may have obtained as\na result of committing the offence.\nEvidence: The Respondent\n11. The main evidence for the Respondent was given by Mr James Elliott, a\nsenior Environmental Health Officer.\n12. On 8 March 2016, the Respondent served Demolition Orders under\ns.265 of the Housing Act 1985 to remove two structures from the yard\n(including the summer house) by 6 May 2016.\n13. On 17 May 2016, the Respondent served an Improvement Notice on the\nAppellant under ss.11 and 12 of the Act. In essence, Sch.1 to the Improve-\nment Notice stated that the Respondent was satisfied the following Cat-\negory 1 hazards existed on the premises:\n(a) Excess Cold. The notice stated that “the heating is inadequate to heat\nthe unit based on thermal insulation and room sizes, and supplemen-\ntary heaters were in use”. It also stated that “the electricity for the\nproperty is spurred off the supply for 15 Ingleside and funded\nthrough single tariff rate coin meter” so it was “not economic to op-\nerate”.\n\n(b) Fire. The notice stated that “the bedroom is an inner room, accessed\nthrough an open plan kitchen/living room”. The “proximity of the ad-\njacent shed” meant “the only window cannot be opened fully”, result-\ning in there being “no place of final safety”. There was also no provi-\nsion for smoke detection, and the door between the bedroom and\nkitchen was “not a fire door”. The supplementary heaters resulted in\nfire risk. Finally, the door to 15A “requires a key to open and so may\nprevent escape in an emergency”.\nIt was also satisfied that the following Category 2 hazards existed:\n(a) Damp and mould growth. The notice referred to heating which was\ninadequate to control condensation in the bedroom and damage to\nthe laminated floor suggesting water ingress. The “likely cause of\nthis would be the absence or failure of the damp proof course”.\nThere was no mechanical air extractor in the bathroom and no heat-\ning. Similarly, the kitchen lacked mechanical ventilation.\n(b) Electrical hazards. There was evidence of overloading of sockets in\nthe unit.\nSch.3 to the Improvement Notice set out three items of works (relating\nto fire safety) to be completed by 18 June 2016 and a further seven to be\ncompleted by 20 August 2016. These items are set out in full in full in the\nfirst three columns of the Schedule at Appx.A to this determination.\n14. There was no appeal against the Improvement Notice.\n15. Following service of the Improvement Notice, two meetings took place\non 31 May and 14 June 2016, details of which were given in a letter from\nthe Respondent dated 20 June 2016. The meetings related to both the\nImprovement Notice and to the Demolition Orders. The letter suggests\nthat at the meetings, the Appellant admitted he “had not carried out any\nworks to comply with the first timescale” in the Improvement Notice. As\nfar as the Demolition Orders were concerned, the Appellant stated he\nhad said he wished to appeal them but had not yet done so.\n16. On 21 June 2016, Mr Elliott inspected the premises with a Building Con-\ntrol Officer named Pamela Savidge and (according to Mr Elliott) a Pri-\nvate Sector Housing Manager named Bruce Reynolds. Smoke detection\nhad been installed to the living room and bedroom, but the layout had\nnot changed. The Appellant had cut a hole in the wall of the summer\nhouse approx. 60cm wide opposite the bedroom window to allow the\nwindow to open fully. The Appellant was advised this did not fully com-\nply with the Improvement Notice, and Ms Savidge again advised him he\nwould have to make a regularisation application for the works in the no-\ntice.\n17. On 1 August 2016, the Appellant emailed Mr Elliott stating that he had\ncome to see him on 4 July 2016, when he had given Mr Elliott a photo of\nthe bedroom window. Mr Elliott replied on the same day, stating that\n“To re-iterate, the replacement window hinges allow the bedroom\nhinges for 15A Ingleside Crescent to open at 90 degrees which\nwould comply with the criteria for an escape window. Once the tim-\nber structure has been removed from the rear garden of 15 Ingleside\n\nCrescent, and all locks have been removed from the gates separat-\ning the rear garden of 15 Ingleside Crescent from the final exit gate\nthen we would accept this as a viable means of escape.”\n18. Mr Elliott attended the premises again on 12 and 18 October 2016. He\nwas unable to gain access on the former date, but he was able to do so on\n18 October 2016. His file note records that at that stage:\n• Item 3 of Sch.3 to the Improvement Notice: The internal layout\n“had not been changed”. However, a hole had been cut in the wall\nof the summer house facing the bedroom window, so that the win-\ndow could now open outwards to its full extent. In the gap be-\ntween 15A and the summer house, a piece of chipboard had been\nlaid over some breeze blocks laid on their ends to provide level\naccess from the window to the hole cut into the summer house\nwall. Mr Elliott records that “I commented to Mr Cook that this\nwas still not acceptable, he challenged why and I told him that the\nroom was still an inner room and escape through a shed was not\nacceptable. He said he was going to get a second opinion.”\n• Items 6 and 7 of Sch.3 to the Improvement Notice: The laminate\nfloor still showed signs of water damage and there were high\ndamp readings in several areas. It could be seen that in places the\nlaminated floor covering was laid directly on the concrete screed\nbelow, with no thermal insulation. There was mould growth to\none wall of the premises with high damp meter readings.\n• Item 8 of Sch.3 to the Improvement Notice: no fixed heating had\nbeen installed, but there was a new 2kW electric downflow heater\nin the bathroom.\n• Items 9 and 10 of Sch.3 to the Improvement Notice: Extractor\nfans had been installed in the bathroom and kitchen.\nMr Elliott spoke on that occasion to a person called “Mark” who identi-\nfied himself as the tenant of 15A. Mr Elliott suggests that when he asked\nfor a surname and asked how long “Mark” had occupied the premises,\nthe Appellant told this person not to answer. Mr Elliott took photographs\nwhich were provided to the Tribunal.\n19. It later transpired that the person referred to above was called Mark\nPaine. There is an invoice to Mr Paine dated 8 August 2017 for repay-\nment of rent of £500 advanced to him to secure a flat at 125C Clifton\nRoad. This invoice is addressed to Mr Paine at the premises.\n20. On 1 November 2016, Mr Elliott found an advert on the Friday-Ad web-\nsite for letting 15A. A copy was produced, which listed the premises as:\n“Flat for rent self-contained in Lancing, Ground floor, inclusive\nbills, except electricity. Wifi included £700 per month. 1 Month in\nadvance Phone 01903 763055”.\n21. The Appellant was interviewed under caution on 4 November 2016, and\na transcript was provided. He admitted that two people lived in 15A In-\ngleside Crescent named “Amanda” and “Mark” (who Mr Elliott had met).\n\nThey were moving out on 25 November 2016 “under a Notice”. They had\nlived there perhaps 1-3 months and had no tenancy agreement. But he\nadmitted that “I charged them £700 [a] month” in cash. When asked\nwhy he had not complied with the Improvement Notice, the Appellant\nstated that this was “because I haven’t had any response from yourself …\nand I haven’t had a response from Building Regulations”. He stated that\nhe had sent an email to the Respondent’s Building regulations team “be-\ncause I wanted to know about the window, the window, is that accepta-\nble”. The Appellant then mentioned Pamela Savage of the Respondent’s\nbuilding regulations department. The Appellant repeated that he had\nsent Mr Elliott a photograph of the bedroom window and Mr Elliott had\npromised on 4 July 2016 to let him know if the window was acceptable.\nHe had “not heard [Mr Elliott’s] reply yet”. On 1 August 2016 he emailed\nMr Elliott with a reminder and on 3 August 2016 he also emailed Ms\nSavidge. The first email is mentioned above, while the email to Ms\nSavidge as her to “e-mail me, [to] let me [kn]ow if you have seen the\nphoto of 15a Ingleside Crescent” Landing BN15 8EN bedroom window”.\nMs Savidge replied on 5 August 2016 that she would endeavour to re-\nspond … early next week”. The interview transcript states that the Appel-\nlant then said that:\n“When Pamela Savidge came over to me, she said that if the window\nopened 900 and I removed all the locks from the summer house and\nthe gate house and everything else, that the window would be ac-\nceptable.”\nMr Elliott’s response was:\n“I remember that meeting that’s the meeting you were at as well as\nMr Reynolds when we were there. But we said to you at that time\nthat it opens into another building and Pamela Savidge expressed\nher concern about climbing out of the window and into another\nbuilding and that wasn’t acceptable. I remember that because I was\nthere. At no point were you told the window was acceptable. It was\nmade clear that it wasn’t an acceptable means of escape. from an\ninner room bedroom. The Notice did not specify change in the win-\ndow. The notice specified change the layout of the property.”\nThe Appellant then referred to a letter dated 9 March 2016 from Mr\nGarry Goacher in Building Control (“the Goacher letter”). Mr Elliott re-\nplied that the Garry Goacher letter was in fact sent on behalf of Ms\nSavidge. The letter suggested the Appellant might choose to make a reg-\nularisation application for building control purposes. In fact, the Appel-\nlant had not made any such application. But the Applicant still “failed to\ncomply with the Improvement Notice”. When asked why he had failed to\ncomply with the notice, the he had “basically” relied in the Goacher letter\n“and not responding to emails as well”. The Appellant specifically re-\nferred to the phrase in the Goacher letter which stated “we will not un-\ndertake enforcement”, to which Mr Elliott responded that:\n“that is Building Control … but you now need to complete works to\ncomply with the Private Sector Housing Team Notice that I served\non you the Improvement Notice on the 17th May and those works,\nbecause you are carrying them out, will be subject to Building Reg-\nulations”.\n\n22. Mr Elliott refers to an appeal by the Appellant against the Demolition\nOrders. He produced a copy of a decision of this Tribunal dated 9 No-\nvember 2016 confirming the orders. But which required them to be de-\nmolished by 27 January 2017. The Appellant apparently applied for per-\nmission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and there was an application for\njudicial review to the High Court (Case no.CO/2514/2017), presumably\nrelating to a refusal of permission to appeal by the Upper Tribunal. Mr\nElliott attended the premises on 3 May 2017 and was refused access, ap-\nparently as a result of the pending appeals.\n23. Mr Elliott was able to gain access on 25 July 2017 using a warrant. He\ntook photographs and made a file note. The premises seemed occupied.\nHe noted there was by this stage a “fixed panel heater in each room”. He\nalso noted that the quick release catch to the side gate had been changed\nback to a key operated lock.\n24. The Appellant was again interviewed under caution on 13 September\n2016. In interview, he stated that 15A was occupied by his wife, who lived\nin the house at the same time. She did not sleep in the bungalow because\nthere were guests living there. The last time 15A had been “tenanted” was\na year before (i.e. September 2016), when the tenant was a Ms Victoria\nScarley. She had lived there for a couple of months. The Appellant then\nsaid Ms Scarley had not been charged a rent, because she was his sister’s\ndaughter. The Appellant refused to answer questions about why he had\nnot completed the works.\n25. On 10 November 2017, the Respondent was granted a further warrant to\nenter the premises in respect of the Demolition Orders under Housing\nAct 2004.\n26. On 28 February 2018, officers from the Respondent executed the war-\nrant and demolished the two structures including the summer house. Mr\nElliott attended and inspected. His findings and set out in the fourth to\nsixth columns of a Scott Schedule provided to the Appellant on 20 June\n2018. This is the Schedule which appears in Appx.A to this determina-\ntion. While doing so, Mr Elliott spoke to a Ms Bethany Inscoe, who iden-\ntified herself as the tenant. She provided a copy of a tenancy agreement\nbeginning on 25 October 2017 at a rent of £700 per month. The Tribunal\nwas shown a copy of that tenancy agreement. Again, Mr Elliott took pho-\ntographs which were produced to the Tribunal.\n27. Ms Inscoe apparently moved out of the premises on 6 March 2018.\n28. On 7 March 2018, the Respondent determined that a Civil Penalty Notice\nshould be issued in the light of the Respondent’s Private Sector Housing\nEnforcement Policy (a copy of which was provided to the Tribunal) and\nthe Guidance. He completed a decision-making document dated 4 May\n2018 which assessed the level of penalty on a points basis. A copy was\nprovided to the Tribunal.\n\n29. The Respondent served a Notice of Intent dated 8 May 2018 by first-class\npost. The Applicant acknowledged receipt on 29 May 2018. On 13 June\n2018 the Respondent served the Final Notice which is appealed against.\n30. Mr Elliott was cross-examined by the Appellant with the assistance of\nthe Tribunal.\n31. First, it was put to Mr Elliott that the bedroom window itself met the\nrequirements for an “escape window”. Mr Elliott responded that the na-\nture and the dimensions of the window itself was acceptable as an “es-\ncape window”, but that this did not in itself meet the requirements of the\nImprovement Notice. There was no sufficient means of egress to a place\nof safety – initially because the summer house prevented the window\nfrom opening, and afterwards because of the locked gates across the fire\nescape route.\n32. Secondly, the Appellant challenged the account of events at the meetings\non 31 May and 14 June 2016. Mr Elliott did not accept that Mr Reynolds\nwas not present. The Appellant put to Mr Elliott that at the meeting, the\nAppellant asked what he had to do to comply with the Improvement No-\ntice. He suggested that Ms Savidge replied it would be acceptable if the\nAppellant (1) enabled the window to turn at 900 and (2) removed the lock\nto the side gate. Mr Elliott denied this. He maintained that what Ms\nSavidge said was that the means of escape would not be acceptable if it\nwent though another building. Mr Elliott accepted he had not made a\nnote of the conversation at the time. As to the email from Mr Elliott of 1\nAugust 2016, he did not accept this confirmed the Appellant’s version of\nevents.\n33. Third, the Appellant made a sustained attack on Mr Elliott’s veracity.\nThis line of questioning arose from para 17 of the decision of the First-\ntier Tribunal (Property Chamber) on 9 November 2017. This refers to\ninformation given to Mr Elliott by Mr Paine in October and November\n2016, which was relied upon by the Respondent in the appeal against the\nDemolition Orders. The Appellant put to Mr Elliott that Mr Paine did not\npay his rent, that he was a violent individual, and that he had later ad-\nmitted misleading the previous Tribunal. Mr Elliott responded that he\nhad only met Mr Paine on 3-4 occasions and that the latter had never\nadmitted lying. The Appellant then put to Mr Elliott that he “promised\nto help Mr Paine out with the rent” in return for giving helpful evidence.\nThe Council was “putting words into [Mr Paine’s] mouth”. Mr Elliott re-\nfuted the allegation and referred to his note of the inspection on 18 Oc-\ntober 2016. That was the first time he had met Mr Paine, but following\nthat, Mr Paine had voluntarily come to the Respondent’s offices. Mr El-\nliott admitted the Respondent had provided Mr Paine with housing as-\nsistance by providing £500 in advance rent to secure another tenancy.\nBut that was not connected with the evidence given to the First-tier Tri-\nbunal in November 2016 – and in any event the Respondent had asked\nfor repayment of the money advanced.\n\n34. Fourth, the Appellant took Mr Elliott through the information the Re-\nspondent had about occupiers from time to time. Mr Elliott referred to\nan occupier named Steven Pickett, who had lived at 15A for three years\nup to June 2016. Then there was Mr Paine, who had lived there with his\npartner from June 2016. There was Ms Victoria Scarley, Ms Inscoe and\nthe current occupier, Mr Robert Harris. The Appellant put to Mr Elliott\nthat there was no evidence any of them paid money to him, but Mr Elliott\nreferred to the copy of Ms Inscoe’s tenancy agreement produced to the\nTribunal.\n35. The Respondent also relied on evidence from Ms Colley Nikita Colley, a\nPrivate Sector Housing Officer who relied on a statement dated 17 Au-\ngust 2018. Ms Colley was party to the meeting on 8 May 2018 where the\ndecision was made to impose the financial penalty. She helped complete\nthe decision-making document with Mr Elliott.\nThe Respondent’s submissions\n36. Ms Lovegrove relied on the Respondent’s Statement of Case dated 12 Au-\ngust 2018, which she expanded upon at the hearing.\n37. Ms Lovegrove submitted that on any issue of fact, the Appellant’s evi-\ndence lacked credibility. A previous Tribunal had found this in other pro-\nceedings. He had sought to portray himself in this case as confused, but\nhe was fully “cognisant”. His approach was to fish around for remedies.\nFor example, he went to Building Control and even Brighton and Hove\nCity Council for “ammunition”. But the second opinion he eventually ob-\ntained from Brighton Council did not help with the Improvement Notice\nat all. There was no tangible basis for any criticism of Mr Elliott, and the\nallegation against Mr Paine was made without substance. Parts of his ev-\nidence were demonstrably false.\n38. Counsel contended that the Improvement Notice had not been appealed\nand that it was unassailable. The Notice of Intent and Final Notice were\nregular. As to the breaches of the Improvement Notice, Ms Lovegrove\nrelied upon Mr Elliott’s evidence of fact, and in particular his inspection\non 28 February 2018, which is summarised in Appx.A to this determina-\ntion. The Respondent further submitted that:\n(a) Mr Elliott was not lying. He had nothing to gain in doing so.\n(b) There had been several forms of enforcement action taken against\nthe Appellant.\n(c) The material relied on by the Appellant dealt with enforcement of\nBuilding Regulation and Planning, not the Improvement Notice.\n(d) There is nothing to suggest no enforcement action would be taken\nfor failure to comply with the Improvement Notice. Indeed, the let-\nter of 20 June 2016 and the email of 1 August 2016 were clear.\n(e) The inspection on 28 August 2018 showed there was a failure to\ncomply some 16 months after the Improvement Notice was given.\n39. As to the level of financial penalty, Ms Lovegrove accepted the Tribunal\ncould have regard to matters other than the factors set out in section 3.3\n\nof the Guidance, provided it took those factors into account. She referred\nto the decision-making document. She urged the Tribunal to take a sim-\nilar approach to that taken by the Respondent, and to confirm the pen-\nalty of £22,100.\n40. Finally, the Tribunal raised an issue about the maximum level of penalty,\nprincipally under the first factor in the Guidance. If there was a maxi-\nmum penalty of £30,000, it might be said that such a penalty ought only\nto be reserved for the most severe offence and the most notorious of-\nfender. For example, it could not be said that the Appellant in this case\nfell into the same category as the late Peter Rachman. However, counsel\ninvited the Tribunal to take into account that a civil penalty was only one\nof two remedies for breach of an Improvement Notice. The most severe\noffences and the most notorious offenders would be prosecuted in the\nmagistrates’ court. The maximum financial penalty of £30,000 could be\nimposed even where the failure to comply with an Improvement Notice\ndid not fall into the highest category of offence.\nThe Appellant’s evidence and submissions\n41. The Appellant was unclear about whether he accepted the procedural re-\nquirements of s.30 and Sch.13A were met, so the Tribunal indicated the\nRespondent would need to prove this was the case.\n42. As to the alleged failure to take the remedial actions specified in Appx.3\nto the Improvement Notice, the Appellant was taken to the schedule re-\nproduced in Appx.A to this determination. His position was as follows:\n(a) Item 1: The Appellant contended he installed automatic fire detec-\ntion and alarms within the property before 18 June 2016. He ac-\ncepted he had not provided a certificate to show these were “suita-\nble for the layout and risk”. The units were installed by a qualified\nelectrician named Paul Pursley. When asked by the Tribunal, the\nAppellant said he paid Mr Pursley £300 in cash for this work, but\nthat he had no receipts.\n(b) Item 2: The Appellant accepted the evidence given by Mr Elliott\nabout alterations to the internal layout of the property to make the\nbedroom and ‘inner room’.\n(c) Item 3: The Appellant again accepted the evidence given by Mr El-\nliott about the side gate.\n(d) Items 4 and 5: The Appellant accepted no Domestic Electrical In-\nstallation Periodic Report had been provided. However, the elec-\ntrical installations had been put in by Mr Pursley, a qualified elec-\ntrician.\n(e) Item 6: The Appellant wholly rejected the assertion he failed to\nensure the thermal insulation met the requirements of current\nBuilding Regulations. He had installed a new floor and insulation\nto the walls. When asked by the Tribunal, the Appellant described\nthe thermal insulation as “wool insulation” for written evidence to\nconfirm this work (such as contractor receipts, work specifications\netc.), the Appellant invited the Tribunal to “rely on my word that it\nhas been done”.\n\n(f) Item 7: Again, the Appellant said that damp proofing required by\nthe Improvement Notice had been “completely done”. An “all new\nfloor” had been provided “months ago”. When asked by the Tribu-\nnal the Appellant said the damp work was carried out by a Mr\nMick Miller in June 2016. He paid him £700-£800 to do this\nwork. The Appellant did not provide any written evidence to con-\nfirm the work was carried out.\n(g) Item 8. The Appellant accepted he had not complied with this re-\nquirement.\n(h) Items 9 and 10: The Appellant said he had installed the two ex-\ntractor fans required before 20 August 2018. Again, they had been\ninstalled by Mr Pursley, but he accepted no certificate had been\nprovided by the electrician.\n43. As to the breaches which are admitted, the Appellant gave evidence for\nthe reasons he had not complied. As soon as the Appellant received the\nImprovement Notice, he got someone to carry out all the works. Mr\nPaul Pursley was an electrician who lived across the road from the Ap-\npellant. He installed smoke detetctors and extractor fans and checked\nthe wiring throughout. There was no problem with the wiring. He\npromised to give the Appellant with a certificate as soon as the summer\nhouse was sorted out.\n44. He said “my argument is that everyone told me I did not need to com-\nply with the Improvement Notice. If Mr Elliott had accepted the escape\nwindow (like Pamela Savidge did), the Improvement Notice would have\nbeen completed within the time stated in the notice”. He referred to\nmeetings on 31 May and 14 June 2016, and Ms Savidge’s statements\nabout the bedroom window. There was also the Goacher letter, which\nexpressly stated that “we will not undertake enforcement”. Mr Elliott\nlater refused to accept the escape window: see email from Mr Elliott\ndated 1 August 2016 referred to above. The Appellant therefore ap-\nproached building control officers at Brighton & Hove City Council. In\nan email dated 23 November 2016, he asked “I just wanted to [know] if\nmy escape window meet building reg”. Mr Conor Stevens (a Building\nControl Surveyor) reassured him that:\n“I can confirm than an egress window will be acceptable providing\nthat the window has a clear opening space at least 450mm in one\ndimension and a total area of 0.33m2. The window must also be\nsituated no higher than 1.1m from finished floor level”.\n45. The Appellant was asked to address the seven factors which should be\ntaken into account in deciding the amount of any civil penalty in section\n3.3 to the Guidance. He submitted as follows:\n(a) Severity of the Offence. There was no real default and no “danger”\nto anyone.\n(b) Culpability and track record. The Appellant had always tried to be\nobliging to the Respondent, although he had got annoyed with\nthem on occasion.\n(c) The harm caused to the tenant. No harm was caused to the tenants.\n\n(d) Punishment of the offender. It was relevant that he had been\ncaused considerable inconvenience over the past 3 years in dealing\nwith the Notice. He had also been the victim of violence from Mr\nPaine, who had slashed the Appellant’s car tyres.\n(e) Deter the offender from repeating the offence. The Appellant did\nnot intend to be in breach, and would not repeat the offence.\n(f) Deter others form committing similar offences.\n(g) Remove any financial benefit the offender may have obtained as a\nresult of committing the offence. He had not received anything like\nthe suggested rent of £16,000 over the past three years, and had to\npay Council Tax for 15A in any event.\n46. As to other considerations, the Appellant stated that when “Mr Elliott\ndemolished my shed [in February 2018], he tore off the roof” of the\nbungalow. Repairs to the roof cost £3,386. As a result, he had recently\nagreed a Debt Management Plan. He was retired, and received a state\npension of £186/week, a private pension of £250/week and £26.67\nfrom other investments. He received no rental income and owned no\nother properties than this one.\n47. The Appellant was cross-examined by counsel. It was put to him that he\nhad “not put in a ‘fixed’ heating system”, to which the Appellant an-\nswered “No, I put in oil fired radiators”. He considered that all the\nworks required by the Improvement Notice had been done. He ac-\ncepted he had not previously mentioned either Mr Pursley or Mr Miller,\nbut the Respondent put this down to “lack of experience on my part”.\nAs to the allegations against Mr Elliott, it was suggested that there was\nno reason for him to lie, to which the Appellant stated that Mr Elliott\nwas dragging things out and had had no reason to “look into” his house.\n48. In relation to the alleged statements about the bedroom window, coun-\nsel took the Appellant through the emails and correspondence. The let-\nter of 20 June 2016 gave details of the meetings on 31 May and 14 June\n2016 involving the Appellant, Clare Pink, Mr Elliott and Ms Savidge.\nThe Appellant accepted he was told that at that stage that the works re-\nquired a regularisation certificate. He was whether he “confirmed” at\nthe meetings “that you had not carried out any works to comply with\nthe first timescale [in the Improvement Notice]”, as suggested in the\nletter. The Appellant said “I didn’t say that at the meeting. I had done\nsome works”. Counsel put to the Appellant that whatever he may have\npreviously understood about the bedroom window, from the time of Mr\nElliott’s email of 1 August 2016, the position was abundantly clear. The\nbedroom window hinges complied with the building regulation criteria\nfor an escape window, but to comply with the Improvement Notice (i)\nthe “timber structures” in the yard had to be removed and (ii) locks had\nto be removed from gates separating the yard from final exit gate. The\nonly answer the Appellant could give was that he could “not think” and\nwas “lost now”. Counsel then took the Appellant to the similar state-\nment in the file note of the inspection of 18 October 2016, when Mr El-\nliott had told the Appellant the bedroom “was still an inner room and\nescape through a shed was not acceptable”. The Appellant stated he\n\nrelied on what he had previously been told by Ms Savidge. As to the\nlaminated floor, the Appellant agreed it was in the condition suggested\nby Mr Elliott when he inspected on 18 October 2016. But the Appellant\ndid the works as soon as he got the Improvement Notice. Counsel put\nthe photographs of the floor to the witness, and he agreed it did not\nshow new flooring. But he suggested this was a patch between the bed-\nroom and living room which had not been replaced.\n49. Counsel then cross-examined about occupation. The Appellant ac-\ncepted the premises were capable of housing a family from March 2015\nonwards. The Appellant accepted that Ms Inscoe had a tenancy agree-\nment for a year from 26 October 2017, but he she moved out on 6\nMarch 2018. It was also put to the Appellant that in the course of the\nprevious Tribunal proceedings, he had denied that the summer house\nwas being used for habitable accommodation. On this question, the Tri-\nbunal was unable to conclude that the Appellant was “an honest and re-\nliable witness”: see para 25 of the Tribunal’s decision. The Appellant\nsaid he had told no lies and did not feel he was being dishonest “one lit-\ntle bit”. The premises had been empty for 18mo-2yrs out of the last\nthree years. The current occupier paid no rent. He simply did work for\nthe Appellant, perhaps 2-3 days at a time. His name was Robert Harris.\n50. It was suggested that the Applicant had tried to frustrate implementa-\ntion of the works and contested matters at every step. He had refused\naccess, so that the Respondent had to obtain warrants on at least two\noccasions. The Appellant agreed he had contested them. It was also\nsuggested he had temporarily installed a lock on the side gate, and ap-\npealed the Demolition Order, all to frustrate the works.\nReasoning\n51. As explained above, the appeal is by way of rehearing.\n52. The Tribunal first considered whether the procedural requirements of\ns.30 and Sch.13A were met. As far as the Improvement Notice is con-\ncerned, there has been no appeal against that notice. The Tribunal is\ntherefore satisfied that the notice became “operative” within the mean-\ning of s.30(1) of the Act. The Respondent produced copies of the Notice\nof Intent dated 8 May 2018 and the Final Notice dated 13 June 2018, and\nMr Elliott gave evidence of service (which was not challenged). The Tri-\nbunal has considered both notices and it is satisfied they comply with the\nrespective requirements of paras 2-3 and 7-8 of Sch.13A to the Act. The\nprocedural requirements of s.30 and Sch.13A have therefore been met.\n53. The Tribunal has next considered the alleged breaches of the require-\nments of the Improvement Notice. This is essentially a question of fact.\nAgain, the Tribunal reminds itself that it must be satisfied of the facts\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\n54. The Tribunal heard oral evidence from both the Appellant and Mr Elliott.\nIn assessing this evidence, the Tribunal found Mr Elliott to be an impres-\nsive and truthful witness. In particular, his evidence was supported by\n\nnotes of inspection and there were no obvious points on which his evi-\ndence was contradicted by correspondence or other written material. By\ncontrast, the Tribunal was far less impressed with the oral evidence of\nthe Appellant. His case lacked even the most basic documentation to\nsupport the wide-ranging assertions made. And where capable of being\nchecked, they were frequently proved wrong. So, for example, the sug-\ngestion there was a new floor, thermal insulation etc. proved inaccurate\nwhen the Tribunal later inspected the premises. Moreover, the Applicant\nmade a sustained attack on Mr Elliott’s veracity based on an alleged ar-\nrangement with Mr Mark Paine in the previous Tribunal proceedings.\nThis allegation was wholly unsupported by oral evidence from anyone\nother than the Appellant. There was no obvious motive for Mr Elliott to\nreach such an arrangement with Mr Paine, and none was suggested by\nthe Appellant. The invoice to Mr Paine dated 8 August 2017 for repay-\nment of rent of £500 is, in the Tribunal’s view, incapable of supporting\nthe suggested improper arrangement. It was a routine payment by an-\nother housing officer and made in relation to a completely separate prop-\nerty. More significantly, it was an invoice requiring Mr Paine to pay the\nCouncil, not the other way round. This Tribunal also cannot ignore that\na previous Tribunal expressly found the Appellant to be untruthful, in\nproceedings involving the Demotion Order referred to in this matter.\nWhere there is a difference between the parties on the factual evidence,\nthe Tribunal prefers the evidence of Mr Elliott, and it attaches little\nweight to the oral evidence of the Appellant unless it is supported by doc-\numentation in the hearing bundle.\n55. By reference to each of the remedial actions set out in Appx.A to this de-\ntermination, it makes the following findings of fact:\n(a) Item 1. The Tribunal finds that the remedial action was only partly\ncompleted by the date completion date specified in the Improve-\nment Notice, namely 18 June 2016. The Tribunal accepts the Appel-\nlant installed mains-powered smoke detectors within this timescale,\nsince Mr Elliott recorded them as being there on 21 June 2016. But\nthere is no evidence the detectors were “suitable for the layout and\nrisk within the property”, which is a specific requirement of the Im-\nprovement Notice. The Appellant accepted he has not provided any\nMinor Electrical Works certificate or other evidence from a qualified\nperson to show the detectors were suitable.\n(b) Item 2. The notice specified that action should be taken to ensure the\nbedroom was not an ‘inner room’, but it gave the Appellant a choice\nof how to achieve this objective. The notice suggested one method,\nnamely the removal of the partition between living room and bed-\nroom, so that that the occupiers of the bedroom had a fire escape\nalong a designated route to a place of safety in the car port. This route\nwould involve going through the main door and side gate (using a\nthumb latch to exit). In fact, the Appellant initially chose to provide\nan alternative means of fire escape from the bedroom window by the\nsimple expedient of cutting a hole in the wall of the summer house\nand creating a chipboard and breeze block bridge across the gap be-\ntween the two structures. The Tribunal finds that the bedroom did\nnot cease to be an ‘inner room’ as a result of this arrangement, and\n\nthat this was the situation as at 18 June 2016 when the remedial ac-\ntion should have been completed. Subsequently, the Applicant chose\na second method of providing suitable fire escape route by demolish-\ning the summer house completely. The Tribunal accepts the yard was\nenclosed and cluttered and was not suitable as a place of safety for\nemergency escape purposes. In case of fire, the nearest place of safety\nwas the car port, and removal of the summer house provided an es-\ncape route which involved a complex process of going through the\nbedroom window into the yard, through the garden gate and the en-\nclosed area and then through the side gate into the car port. It follows\nthat the Tribunal finds the remedial action specified in item 2 was not\ncompleted at all by the date set out in the Improvement Notice,\nnamely 18 June 2016. It was partially completed when the summer\nhouse was demolished on 28 February 2018.\n(c) Item 3. The action to alter the “external access/egress door” (i.e. the\nside gate) was originally completed by the date set out in the Im-\nprovement Notice, namely 18 June 2016. For some reason, this was\nreplaced by a lock (as seen on the inspection on 25 July 2017), but by\n28 February 2018 had reverted back to a quick-release mechanism.\n(d) Items 4 and 5. The Appellant has not supplied Worthing Borough\nCouncil a current (or indeed any) Domestic Electrical Installation Pe-\nriodic Report for the whole of the electrical installation in the build-\ning. It follows he has also failed to carry out work to remedy any Code\n1 or Code 2 defects listed in such a report. The remedial actions in\nitems 3 and 4 were not completed by the date set out in the Improve-\nment Notice, namely 20 August 2016, and has not been completed by\nthe hearing date.\n(e) Item 6. The Tribunal finds there is no effective thermal insulation to\nthe premises. The external walls appear to be a single course of ren-\ndered brickwork with no layer of insulation. There was no evidence\nthe felt roofing included any thermal insulation layer and the floor\ncoverings were laid directly on top of the concrete screed. Moreover,\nit appears the power for the heating has always been supplied by the\nsame single tariff coin-operated meter, which Schedule 1 to the Im-\nprovement Notice suggested was “not economic to operate”. The ev-\nidence of Mr Elliott, supported by the various inspection notes, sug-\ngests no work has been carried out in relation to thermal insulation\nsince the Improvement Notice. The Tribunal rejects any suggestion\nby the Appellant that he installed a new floor and wall insulation\nsince the Improvement Notice. On inspection, it was clear that the\ndamaged laminate flooring was of some vintage, and it quite obvi-\nously pre-dated the Improvement Notice. Similarly, there was no ev-\nidence of work to the walls in recent times. If a new floor or wall in-\nsulation was provided, this plainly pre-dated the Improvement No-\ntice. Since the Appellant has undertaken no “remedial actions speci-\nfied in the notice” the issue of compliance with current building reg-\nulations does not arise.\n(f) Item 7. The Tribunal finds there is no effective damp proofing,\nwhether in compliance with building regulations or at all. On inspec-\ntion, there was no membrane or other means of preventing damp ris-\ning through the concrete screed to the floor. There was evidence of\n\ndamage to the laminated flooring consistent with damp. The evi-\ndence of Mr Elliott, supported by the various inspection notes, sug-\ngests no work has been carried out in relation to damp proofing since\nthe Improvement Notice. Once again, the Tribunal rejects any sug-\ngestion by the Appellant that he undertook any damp proofing works\nto the floor “months ago”. This would have been impossible without\nlifting the laminate floor, which had plainly not been disturbed for\nsome time. Since the Appellant has undertaken no “remedial actions\nspecified in the notice” the issue of compliance with current building\nregulations does not arise. The remedial action in item 7 was there-\nfore not completed by the date set out in the Improvement Notice,\nnamely 20 August 2016, and has not been completed by the hearing\ndate.\n(g) Item 8. The remedial action specified in item 8 was fairly clear. The\nImprovement Notice required the Appellant to provide a fixed heat-\ning system that met certain standards. The Notice went on to give\ntwo options, namely (1) gas-fired central heating and (2) electrical\nheating including modern combi-storage heaters, a 2k wall-\nmounted heater in the shower room and a dual tariff electric meter.\nThe Appellant certainly fitted a 2kW wall-mounted heater in the\nshower room before October 2016, but plainly failed to go on to in-\nstall any other elements of the “fixed” heating system. There is a\nphotograph dated 28 February 2018 which shows a single electric\npanel heater attached to the wall of the living room, and some evi-\ndence that there may have been panel heaters in the past, but panel\nheaters were not seen on inspection. Portable oil-fired heaters do\nnot meet the requirements for a “fixed” system. The Tribunal finds\nas a fact that no has been provided – whether “effective, efficient\nand economical” or otherwise. The remedial action in item 8 was\nnot completed by the date set out in the Improvement Notice,\nnamely 20 August 2016, and has not been completed by the hearing\ndate. In any event, at the hearing the Appellant fully accepted he\nhad not complied with item 8.\n(h) Items 9 and 10. The Tribunal finds the Appellant installed extractor\nfans in the kitchen and shower room on or before the date specified\nin the Improvement Notice, namely 20 August 2016. The Appellant\naccepted he had not provided any Minor Electrical Works certificate\nor other evidence that the fans were installed by a suitably qualified\nperson. The Tribunal is not therefore satisfied the fans are “suita-\nble” as required by items 9 and 10 of the Improvement Notice. The\nremedial actions were only partially completed by the date set out in\nthe Improvement Notice, namely 20 August 2016, and they re-\nmained only partially completed by the hearing date.\n56. The Tribunal takes into account the general argument advanced by the\nAppellant that but for the bedroom window, he in fact complied with the\nImprovement Notice. This is patently wrong and the argument is re-\njected. The factual findings above are wholly inconsistent with this. In-\ndeed, even if he was correct that the bedroom window was acceptable as\na fire escape window (which the Respondent accepts), this did not in it-\nself mean the bedroom ceased to be an “inner room” as required by Item\n\n3 of Sch.3 to the Improvement Notice. That is quite apart from the failure\nto remedy other matters in Sch.3.\n57. Under s.30(1), a person commits an offence if he fails to “comply” with\nan Improvement Notice once it has become operative. Unlike under\ns.198A of the Housing Act 1985, any failure to comply under s.30(1) does\nnot have to be “intentional” on the part of the Applicant. Under\ns.30(2)(a) of the Act, “compliance” with an Improvement Notice means\nin relation to each hazard, beginning and completing any remedial ac-\ntion specified in the notice … not later than the date specified under sec-\ntion 13(2)(e) and within the period specified under section 13(2)(f)”. The\nlatter dates are given in Appx.A to this determination. By reason of the\nabove findings of fact, the Tribunal is satisfied the Appellant failed to\ncomplete any of the ten “remedial actions” specified in Sch.3 to the Im-\nprovement Notice. The only remedial action which was wholly com-\npleted by the date specified in the Notice was Item 3. But the Tribunal\nnotes the continued duty under s.30(5) of the Act to take remedial action\nafter the period for completion specified in the notice has passed. For a\nperiod of time between 25 July 2017 and 28 February 2018, there was a\nbreach of this continuing duty.\n58. As explained, in proceedings against a person for an offence under sub-\nsection (1) it is a defence under s.30(4) that he had “a reasonable excuse\nfor failing to comply with the notice”. In this respect, two propositions\ncan be made derived from the decision of Ouseley J. in Haringey LBC v\nGoremsandhu:\n• An honest but mistaken belief is not a reasonable excuse defence.\nIt may be a part of a reasonable excuse defence when the sur-\nrounding circumstances to the holding of that belief are taken into\naccount: para 25. This proposition was derived from the judgment\nof the Court of Appeal in R v Unah [2011] EWCA Crim 1837;\n[2012] 1 WLR 505.\n• There are two components to this defence: First, if a belief is re-\nlied on it must be an honest belief. Second, there have to be rea-\nsonable grounds for the holding of that belief. That is an objective\nquestion: para 27. This proposition was in turn derived from the\nanother Court of Appeal judgment in R v Y(A) [2010] EWCA Crim\n762; [2010] 1 WLR 2644.\n59. The Appellant argued that he did not comply with the Improvement No-\ntice because “everyone told me I did not need to comply with” it. Before\ndealing with the criteria set out above, it is worth considering each of the\nalleged matters relied on by the Appellant in this regard:\n(a) There is the alleged statement by Ms Savidge that “if the window\nopened 90O and [the Appellant] removed all the locks from the\nsummer house and the gate house and everything else, that the\nwindow would be acceptable”. This was supposedly said at a meet-\ning on 31 May or 14 June 2016. Insofar as it is suggested that Ms\nSavidge may have be saying that the Improvement Notice did not\nneed to be complied with, this is rejected for a number of reasons.\nFirst, it is unlikely Ms Savidge would have commented on the\n\nImprovement Notice. She worked for the Respondent’s Building\nControl team, and was not responsible for the notice. The Tribunal\nalso accepts Mr Elliott was present at the meeting. Otherwise his\nletter dated 20 June 2016 would have been a fabrication and his\nevidence to the Tribunal a lie. Mr Elliott’s account of the meeting\nclearly suggests he told the Respondent he needed to comply with\nthe Improvement Notice, and Ms Savidge did not demur.\n(b) The letter of 20 June 2016 does not suggest the Appellant need not\ncomply with the Improvement Notice. Quite the opposite.\n(c) The email of 1 August 2016 from Mr Elliott clarified that whilst the\nbedroom window could comply with the criteria for a fire escape\nwindow, this would not be enough to comply with the Improvement\nNotice. The summer house still needed to be demolished.\n(d) The advice given by Brighton and Hove City Council was specifi-\ncally given by a Building Control Surveyor in response to an enquiry\nby the Appellant as to whether the “escape window [would] meet\nbuilding reg”. It was nothing to do with Improvement Notices.\n(e) The Goacher letter simply does not support the argument advanced\nby the Appellant. The line in the Goacher letter stating that “we will\nnot undertake enforcement” was taken out of context. The relevant\npassage is as follows:\n“… although the planning enforcement case is closed on [the\ngarage conversion] – the building control aspect of this devel-\nopment remains open. You would at the time of conversion\nrequired a building control application and although we will\nnot undertake enforcement, the work still remains unauthor-\nised and this will be revealed on any property searches which\nmay affect any potential future sale of this property”.\nThe passage in italics plainly and unambiguously refers to enforce-\nment of building controls, not the Improvement Notice.\n(f) In the recorded interviews, Mr Elliott repeatedly stressed to the Ap-\npellant the difference between meeting building regulation require-\nments for an escape window and carrying out works under the No-\ntice.\n(g) The bedroom window was not even mentioned in the Improvement\nNotice.\n60. In the light of the above, the Tribunal is sure there is no reasonable ex-\ncuse defence. The circumstances of the holding of the relevant belief\nwere that there were requirements in building regulations for a window\nto be an escape window, and rather wider and different requirements set\nout in the Improvement Notice. This difference was repeatedly explained\nto the Appellant. Even if the Appellant honestly believed that complying\nwith one would discharge his obligation to comply with the other, there\nwere no objectively reasonable grounds for the holding of that belief.\nEverything the Appellant was told and read pointed to the opposite con-\nclusion.\n61. It follows that the Appellant has failed to comply with the Improvement\nNotice and has committed an offence under s.30(1).\n\nThe Penalty\n62. The Tribunal has considered the seven factors set out in section 3.3 of\nthe Guidance in deciding the level of a civil penalty. It does so without\nadopting the points system used by the Respondent in its decision-mak-\ning document, which is an approach that does not appear in the Guid-\nance. It reaches the following conclusions in respect of each of the fac-\ntors:\n(a) The Tribunal is satisfied that Category 1 hazards continued to be pre-\nsent on the property for a significant period of time. The Improve-\nment Notice listed the Category 1 hazards as “excess cold” and “fire”.\nThe works to remedy excess cold was present as a hazard on 20 Au-\ngust 2016, since no works were undertaken to remedy the lack of\nheating and the poor thermal insulation. The severity of this is exac-\nerbated by (a) the fact this Category 1 hazard existed 18 months after\nthe works should have been completed (b) there have been numerous\nreminders from the Respondent and (c) the premises have been pe-\nriodically occupied by tenants and/or others. The Improvement No-\ntice listed the Category 1 hazards as “excess cold” and “fire”. The\nworks to remedy fire hazards were only partly undertaken before 20\nAugust 2016. Lack of installation certificates for the smoke alarms\nare not serious, but the failure to carry out alterations to stop the bed-\nroom being used as an inner room is a severe feature. This was only\nmitigated by the demolition of the summer house by the Respondent\nin February 2018. The Category 2 hazards were “Damp and Mould\nGrowth” and “Electrical Hazards”. Failure to remedy these is neces-\nsarily less serious than the Category 1 hazards, but they still pose a\nrisk to health, and the risks largely remain today. Both hazards are\nnot towards the highest ends of the scale, since there is no actual ev-\nidence of harm having occurred. The Tribunal considers a moderate\nto serious offence has been committed.\n(b) Culpability and track record of the offender. This is not the first ex-\nperience the Appellant has of the Respondent exercising statutory\nhousing and other powers. There is the Demolition Order (upheld by\nthe Tribunal), and at least two warrants for entry. It should also be\nnoted that the Demolition Order was not complied with even after\nbeing upheld by the Tribunal, and the Respondent had to exercise its\npowers to demolish the structures. In terms of culpability, there is no\ndoubt the Appellant deliberately failed to comply with such parts of\nthe Improvement Order that he did not agree with. He knew he was\nin breach of his obligations. But against this, the Tribunal was not\ntold about any previous civil penalty or prosecution of the Appellant.\nAnd he appears to be a small landlord, with only 15 and 15A available\nfor letting. This is not a large professionally run landlord business.\nThe Tribunal considers that culpability and track record can be de-\nscribed as “moderate”.\n(c) Harm to tenants. There is, as the Appellant suggested, no evidence of\nactual harm to the tenants. That is plainly a mitigating factor. There\nhas been (and continues to be) a risk of harm to health, especially the\nCategory 1 hazard of “Excess Cold”. The Respondent mentions that\none tenant stated his electricity bills in cold weather could exceed £10\n\na day. This factor suggests the punishment should be set at a moder-\nate level.\n(d) Punishment of the offender. On this point, the Tribunal does not\nagree with the submission by counsel that the ‘scale’ of civil penalties\nshould effectively sit below those in a prosecution. The £30,000 max-\nimum is in its view reserved for the most severe offences and offend-\ners. So much is clear from the Guidance, which expressly states that\n“a civil penalty should not be regarded as an easy or lesser option\ncompared to a prosecution”. The limited information given about the\nAppellant’s means and assets suggest that anything more than a\nnominal civil penalty would have a real economic impact on him. But\nit is clear that a substantial penalty is necessary to bring home to the\nAppellant the consequences of not complying with his responsibili-\nties. He has ignored every warning from the Respondent over a long\nperiod of time. This factor suggests the punishment should be set at\na moderate to serious level within the scale of £0-£30,000.\n(e) Deter the offender from repeating the offence. To some extent, this\noverlaps with punishment. In particular, the Appellant seems imper-\nvious to the consequences of keeping a property which he allows oth-\ners to occupy where there are serious risks to their health. The pen-\nalty must be set at a level that deters the Appellant from continuing\nto do this. A moderate to serious penalty would be appropriate.\n(f) Deter others from committing similar offences. Plainly, a culture of\npoor quality “shed” housing is something to be discouraged. But\nthere was no evidence that it was necessary to impose a more signif-\nicant penalty to send a message to others. The penalty in this instance\nis likely to be significant, and (because of the appeal) very public.\nHowever, there is no special reason to increase it to deter others.\n(g) Remove any financial benefit the offender may have obtained as a re-\nsult of committing the offence. This is a matter which seriously con-\ncerns the Tribunal. The Friday-Ad website advert, Ms Inscoe’s ten-\nancy agreement and the Appellant’s evidence of what he charged Mr\nPaine, all pointed to a passing rent of £700 per week. The Appellant\nhas been extremely evasive about the identities and periods of occu-\npation of various occupiers over the years, and the Tribunal places no\nweight on his denial that 15A was tenanted for much of the time. But\ndespite these uncertainties, the Tribunal is satisfied the Appellant has\nreceived significant financial benefit form letting out an unfit prop-\nerty. The Respondent suggests that as much as £16,000 could have\nbeen received for 15A since the Improvement Notice. In fact, a rent\nof £700 per month over the period to the hearing date would now\nexceed £21,000. Doing its best, the Tribunal considers a reasonable\nestimate would be that 75% of this figure has been received. Giving\nsome allowance for costs such as Council Tax suggests that a net rent\nof £15,000 has probably been received. The penalty should be set at\na level to remove this financial benefit.\n63. In the light of all the above factors, the Tribunal considers a civil penalty\nof £15,000 would be appropriate.\n\nConclusions\n64. For the reasons given above, the Tribunal confirms the Final Notice\ndated 20 June 2018 under para 10(4) of Sch.13A to the Act. But it varies\nthe Final Notice to impose a civil financial penalty of £15,000.\nJudge Mark Loveday\n8 January 2018\n\nAppeals\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application\nto the First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing\nwith the case.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the Tri-\nbunal sends to the person making the application written reasons for the\ndecision.\n3. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to ap-\npeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying\nwith the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide whether to ex-\ntend time or not to allow the application for permission to appeal to pro-\nceed.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state the\nresult the party making the application is seeking."

For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR27"

Following an objection from the Landlord to the determination of a fair\nrent by the Rent Officer, the Tribunal has made a determination under\nthe provisions of the Rent Act 1977.\nInspection\n2. The Tribunal did not inspect the property but considered this case on the\nbasis of the papers provided by the parties.\nEvidence\n3. There were no written submissions from the landlord relating to the rent\nbut the landlord did confirm that this is a social rented tenancy. The\nlandlord sought to withdraw the appeal that as the applicant is the\ntenant, only the tenant could withdraw it.\n4. The tenant wrote to the tribunal objecting to the level of rent registered\nand it was considerably above the social rent they currently pay.\n5. No rental evidence was provided by either party.\nDetermination and Valuation\n6. In the absence of rental comparables provided by the parties the tribunal\nhas relied on its own expert, general knowledge of rental values in the\narea. We consider that the open market rent for the property in the\ncondition and with the amenities the market would expect would be in\nthe region of £1800 per month. From this level of rent we have made\nadjustments in relation to:\na. No carpets curtains or white goods\nb. General condition\nThe Tribunal has also made an adjustment for scarcity.\n7. The full valuation is shown below:\n2\n\n8. The Tribunal determines a s70 rent of £1008.00 per month.\n9. Decision\n10. The uncapped fair rent initially determined by the Tribunal, for the\npurposes of section 70, was £1008.00 per week. The capped rent for the\nproperty according to the provisions of the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair\nRent) Order 1999 is calculated at £1049.50 per week The calculation of\nthe capped rent is shown on the decision form. In this case the lower rent\nof £1008 per month is to be registered as the fair rent for this property.\n11. The tribunal notes the landlord’s letter that the rent paid by the tenant\nis a social rent which can only be increased by the rise in the Consumer\nPrices Index plus 1%. The jurisdiction of the tribunal is limited to\nfinding a fair rent as set out in the Rent Act and it has no power over\nthe level of a social rent. If applicable, it is the lower of the social rent\nand fair rent which is due from the tenant.\nChairman: A Harris Date: 20 May 2025\nAPPEAL PROVISIONS\nThese summary reasons are provided to give the parties an indication as to how\nthe Tribunal made its decision. If either party wishes to appeal this decision,\nthey should first make a request for full reasons and the details of how to appeal\nwill be set out in the full reasons.

This is an application made by the applicant qualifying tenants pursuant\nto section 24 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development\nAct 1993 (“the 1993 Act”) for a determination of the premium to be paid\nfor the collective enfranchisement of 29 & 29A Talbot Road, Wembley,\nMiddlesex HA0 4UG (‘the Property’).\n2. On 24 May 2021, the claimants issued a claim in the county court sitting\nat Willesden seeking a vesting order in respect of the freehold of the\nProperty pursuant to section 26(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing\nand Urban Development Act 1993.\n3. The claimants were unable to serve a notice of claim under section 13 of\nthe 1993 Act due to being unable to locate the respondent/defendant\nlandlord.\n4. By an order of District Judge Kumrai dated 25 November 2021 a vesting\norder was granted to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth claimants and the\nmatter transferred to the First-tier Tribunal for a determination of the\nappropriate premium payable for the freehold of the Property and the\nterms of the conveyance.\n5. By an order of Deputy District Judge Orger dated 21 May 2022 the\nmatter was transferred to the First-tier Property Tribunal.\nThe Property\n6. The Property comprises a two/three storey semi-detached house\nconverted into two self-contained flats. The ground floor flat has since\nbeen further converted to form two smaller studio flats at ground floor\nlevel. In 2008 the fifth and sixth claimants/applicants became the\nregistered lessees of Flat 29A under a lease dated 1 August 1973 for a\nterm of 99 years with effect from 24 June 1972. In 2006 the first, second,\nthird and fourth claimants/applicants acquired the interest of Flat 29\nheld under a lease dated 9 February 1979 granting a term of 99 years\nwith effect from 24 June 1972.\nThe issues\n6. The tribunal were required to determine only the following issues:\n(i) The premium payable by the third fourth, fifth and sixth\nclaimants/applicants.\n2\n\n(ii) The terms of the conveyance.\nThe applicant’s case\n7. The applicants relied upon the expert valuation report of Andrew Cohen\nMRICS of Talbots Surveyors and Valuers Limited dated 30 May 2021. In\nthis report, Mr Cohen specified the valuation date as 24 May 2021 being\nthe date of the application made to the county court. Mr Cohen also\nstated that he had ignored the creation of two studio flats from flat 29A\nas a tenant’s improvement in carrying out his valuation.\n8. Mr Cohen stated that the appropriate capitalisation rate is 8% as the\nground rent for both flats in the property is fixed throughout the term at\n£10 per annum per flat and therefore does not present an attractive\nincome to the hypothetical investor.\n9. Mr Cohen adopted a deferment rate of 5% having regard to the court of\nAppeal decision in Cadogan v Sportelli [2007] EWCA Civ 1042.\n10. In reaching an opinion on the unimproved value of each flat on a share\nof freehold basis, Mr Cohen had regard to sales of similar sized flats\nwithin 0.5 miles of the subject in the period January 2021 to August\n2021. Having made adjustments to reflect the differences between the\nflats in the subject Property and the comparable sales, Mr Cohen\nconcluded that the unimproved freehold value of the flats as:\n29a (Ground floor flat) : £350,000\n29 (First floor flat) : £370,000\n11. In reaching a figure for relativity Mr Cohen relied upon the average of\nthe Savills Unenfranchiseable graph (2015)and the Gerald Eve graph\n(2016) which produced an average figure of 70.76% for a lease term of\n50.09 years remaining.\n12. Mr Cohen made an allowance for marriage value as a result of the\npurchase of the freehold and attributed a division of 50% in accordance\nwith the 1993 Act.\n13. Mr Cohen concluded that the appropriate premium to be paid for the\npurchase of the freehold is £136,653.\n14. A draft transfer TR1 was provided by the applicants/claimants setting\nout the proposed terms of transfer.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n15. The tribunal determines that the price payable for the purchase of the\nfreehold is £136,900. The tribunal approves the terms of the draft\n3\n\ntransfer TR1 provided to the tribunal in the applicants/claimants\nhearing bundle.\n16. The tribunal agrees with the approach adopted by Mr Cohen but has\nnoted that his assumption in respect of the amount of ground rent is not\naccurate, as the lease for number 29 should be currently £50.00 with\nprovision to rise to £60.00 per annum. This adjustment has resulted in\nthe marginal increase in the premium to be paid.\n17. The matter is to be remitted to the county court at Willesden for any\nfurther/final orders that may be required.\nName: Judge Tagliavini Date: 13 July 2022\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e., give the date, the property, and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n4"

On 11 September 2018, the site owner made an application to the Tribunal for the\ndetermination of a pitch fee for the premises from 13 August 2018.\nSummary Decision\n2. This case arises out of the site owner’s application, made on 11 September 2018, for\nthe determination of a pitch fee from 13 August 2018. The Tribunal has determined\nthat the pitch fee for that period and from that date should be £159.58.\nCurrent Pitch Fee New Pitch Fee Date of New Pitch Fee\n£ £\n154.03 159.58 13 August 2018\nInspection and Description of Property\n3. The Tribunal inspected the property on 18 December 2018 at 1100. Present at that\ntime was Mr Sunderland; the Tribunal also met and spoke with Mr Dudley at his\nhome. Weather conditions were very poor.\n4. The property is situated on a residential park home site about a mile to the north\nwest of Bodmin, on the A389, connecting the town with the North coast of Cornwall\nwhich is about 15 miles away.\n5. The site slopes down from the main road and number 14 is located at the lower end.\n6. The property is amongst similar units arranged in the style of a bungalow. It has a\npreformed metal roof in the style of concrete tiling. The metal walls are painted and\nfinished with courses of reformed concrete blockwork at the base. The\naccommodation is approached up a short flight of external steps.\n7. The roadways throughout the site are tarmacadam.\nDirections\n8. Directions were issued on 25 October 2018.\n9. The Tribunal directed that the parties should submit specified documentation to the\nTribunal for consideration.\n10. This determination is made in the light of the documentation submitted in response\nto those directions, the Inspection and the evidence and submissions made by the\nparties at the hearing. The Tribunal heard evidence from Mr Dudley, Mr Hassall\nand Mr Sunderland. At the end of the hearing, the parties confirmed that they had\nbeen able to say all that they wished to say to the Tribunal.\nPreliminary Notes\n11. The Tribunal noted that a previous Decision of the Tribunal had identified the\ncorrect Review date as being 2 May. Mr Hassall confirmed his agreement with the\nprocess and figures used by the Applicant to establish the RPI increase relevant to 2\nMay 2018 and that proper processes had been followed by the Applicant in notifying\nthe proposed fee increase.\n12. Mr Hassall also properly conceded that a failure by the Applicant to display a\nLicence for the Park (the Licence displayed showed the name of a previous owner)\nwas not a factor capable of influencing the quantum of the Review. The Tribunal,\naccordingly, does not detail the discussion of that issue.\n13. Mr Hassall also properly conceded that the distance of the electricity meter from the\nRespondent’s pitch was not a factor capable of influencing the quantum of the\nReview. The Tribunal, accordingly, does not detail the discussion of that issue.\n2\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\n14. As will be explained later, the Tribunal found that the correct site Licence for the\nsite did not contain the various conditions the subject of critical analysis by the\nRespondent. The Tribunal, accordingly, does not detail the discussion of those\nconditions.\nThe Law\n15. The law is contained in Mobile Homes Act 1983. Under Section 4, a Tribunal has\njurisdiction to determine the issue of Pitch Fee. The Tribunal can decide if it is\nreasonable for the pitch fee to be changed and whether it is unreasonable for the fee\nto increase or decrease in accordance with the relevant Retail Prices Index for the\nrelevant period and has regard to all of the relevant evidence, but, particularly to the\nfactors detailed in Paragraph 18 of Schedule I, Part 1 of Mobile Homes Act 1983, as\namended.\n16. Paragraph 20 of chapter 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Act provides that the\npresumption is that the pitch fee shall increase or decrease in proportion to the\nmovement in the RPI. The increase in the pitch fee can be greater, however, if the\npresumption would produce an unreasonable amount. Paragraph 18 of chapter 2\nspecifies certain matters to which there must be paid particular regard in\ndetermining the amount of the new pitch fee.\n17. The Tribunal has a wide discretion to vary the pitch fee to a level of a reasonable\npitch fee taking into account all of the relevant circumstances, including factors not\nconnected to improvements, and the increase in RPI in the previous 12 months is\nimportant, but it is not the only factor which may be taken into account. Factors not\nencompassed by paragraph 18(1) may nevertheless provide grounds on which the\npresumption of no more than RPI increases (or decreases) may be rebutted. If\nanother weighty factor means that it is reasonable to vary the pitch fee by a different\namount, effect may be given to that factor.\n18. Paragraph 18(1A) and Paragraph 19 preclude regard being paid to certain matters\non the review but none of those are relevant to these proceedings.\n19. There is advice for the Tribunal about other factors in Vyse v Wyldecrest Parks\n(Management) Limited (2017) UKUT 0024 (LC):\n50. If there is no matter to which any of paragraph 18(1) in terms applies, then\nthe presumption arises and it is necessary to consider whether any ‘other factor’\ndisplaces it. By definition, this must be a factor to which considerable weight\nattaches. If it were a consideration of equal weight to RPI, then, applying the\npresumption, the scales would tip the balance in favour of RPI. Of course, it is\nnot possible to be prescriptive as to precisely how much weight must be attached\nto an ‘other factor’ before it outweighs the presumption in favour of RPI. This\nmust be a matter for the FTT in any particular case. What is required is that the\ndecision maker recognises that the ‘other factor’ must have sufficient weight to\noutweigh the presumption in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole.\n51. On the face of it, there does not appear to be any justification for limiting the\nnature or type of ‘other factor’ to which regard may be had. The paragraphs\nrelating to the amount of the pitch fee expressly set out matters which may or\nmay not be taken into account. “Particular regard shall be had to” the\nparagraph 18(1) factors and there are a number of matters to which the Act\nexpressly states that “no regard shall be had”. If an ‘other factor’ is not one to\nwhich “no regard shall be had” but neither is it one to which “particular regard\nshall be had”, the logical consequence is that regard may be had to it. In my\njudgment this approach accords with the literal construction of the words of the\n3\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\nstatute. Further, it is one which would avoid potentially unfair and anomalous\nconsequences.\n20. The amount of the pitch fee rests solely on what the occupiers agree or the First-tier\nTribunal determines to be reasonable on the annual review.\n21. In respect of a late review notice, the Upper Tribunal advises in Shaw’s Trailer\nPark (Harrogate) Limited v Sherwood (2015) UKUT 0194 (LC):\n41. If the owner does not serve a pitch fee review notice “by the time by which it\nwas required to be served” (i.e. at least 28 days before the review date, as required\nby paragraph 17(2)) but does so “at any time thereafter” (as permitted by\nparagraph 17(6)(b)) then sub-paragraphs 17(7) to (10) apply. A late review notice\ngiven under paragraph 17(6)(b) serves the same purpose and takes the same form\nas an “in-time” review notice under paragraph 17(2): it sets out the owner’s\nproposals in respect of the new pitch fee and must be accompanied by a document\nwhich complies with paragraph 25A. Its effect mirrors the effect of an in-time\nnotice with the sole exception that any new pitch fee which is agreed or determined\nby the FTT following a late review notice will take effect not from the review date\nth\nbut from the 28 day after the date of service of the late review notice (paras 17(7)\nand 17(8)(c)). There is a slight difference in the figures used to calculate the\nrelevant RPI increase although unless an in-time notice is served long before the\nreview date the difference is likely to be insignificant.\n22. In Charles Simpson Organisation Ltd v Redshaw (2010) 2514 (CH), Kitchen\nJ advised:\n“In my judgment, the word “amenity” in the phrase “amenity of the protected site”\nin paragraph 18(1)(b) simply means the quality of being agreeable or pleasant.\nThe Court must therefore have particular regard to any decrease in the\npleasantness of the site or those features of the site which are agreeable from the\nperspective of the particular occupier in issue.”\n23. In this case, the Tribunal has had regard to the totality of the evidence available to\nit.\n24. The relevant statute law is set out in the Appendix below.\nThe Agreed Background\n25. The Applicant gave notice of a proposal to increase the pitch fee on 13 August 2018\nto £159.58 (from £154.03) in line with a 3.6% increase in RPI. There is no issue\ntaken as to the timeliness of the notice, whether appropriate notice was given or the\nappropriate rate to apply.\nThe Park Licence\nThe Applicant\n26. The Applicant raised a number of concerns as to the Applicant’s compliance with\nconditions attached to the site Licence.\nThe Respondent\n27. The Respondent argued that the Respondent was referring to an incorrect Licence\nand that none of the conditions complained about appeared on the correct Licence.\nThe Tribunal\n28. The Tribunal was provided with two Licences purporting to apply to the site. Both\nparties said that they had obtained the Licences from Cornwall Council; the\n4\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\nTribunal finding, as it will explain, that the Applicant’s version is the correct Licence\nand the Respondent’s version the incorrect Licence.\n29. The Tribunal saw two copies of the correct Licence on notice boards at the entrance\nto the site and attached to a store cupboard within the site.\n30. The Tribunal can only determine an issue on the basis of the evidence before it. The\nbest evidence available was a signed witness statement from Graham Thomas\nBailey, Senior Licensing Compliance Officer and Safety Officer with Cornwall\nCouncil, of 28 June 2018. Put succinctly, Mr Bailey indicated an error within the\nCouncil’s database, such that the incorrect Licence had been “incorrectly produced\nand placed in the council’s data base”; it is that licence that the Respondent\nincorrectly believed was the right one.\n31. Further support for that Licence being incorrect can be seen in the conditions\nthemselves, one of which forbids the placement of a “caravan” less than 2 metres\nfrom the road; this condition would be applied from 1 December 2015 when a\nnumber of homes were clearly then less than 2 metres from the road.\n32. One further issue is that the conditions provided by the Respondent appeared to be\na generic list and did not contain the name of this site.\nFire Extinguishers\nThe Respondent\n33. The Respondent was concerned about the removal in 2017 of fire extinguishers from\nthe site. A wall below his home had had a cabinet and 2 associated fire\nextinguishers and bricks from the wall removed on 31 May 2017, replaced by a\nnotice stuck to the wall with black gaffer tape giving safety instructions, effectively,\nin the case of fire, to evacuate, sound the alarm and call the fire brigade.\n34. The Respondent said that the cabinet and extinguisher had been in a poor state for\nsome time and not been checked or serviced since the Applicant took over the site in\nJanuary 2015. He said that he had made a number of complaints to the Applicant.\n35. In questioning by Mr Sunderland, the Respondent said that he had his own\nextinguisher and fire blanket.\nThe Applicant\n36. The Applicant said that there was no evidence of complaints being made.\n37. The Respondent has his own equipment.\n38. Provision of fire-fighting equipment has, since the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety)\nOrder 2005, been the responsibility of the Fire Service and not a matter for the local\nauthority. There was no requirement to have fire-fighting equipment on the\ncommunal parts. There has been a risk assessment. A fire extinguisher is there to\nallow safe exit from the home; people should get clear and call the fire brigade.\n39. There is no requirement under the 1983 Act or site licence requirement for fire-\nfighting equipment.\nThe Tribunal\n40. The Tribunal notes the legal requirements relative to fire safety. Mr Sunderland is\ncorrect to say that the issue is dealt with primarily by the Regulatory Reform (Fire\nSafety) Order 2005, but that Order places responsibilities upon the Applicant far\ngreater than Mr Sunderland appeared to appreciate.\n41. Section 5(2A) Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 states: Where the\nRegulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 applies to the land, no condition is to\nbe attached to a site licence in so far as it relates to any matter in relation to which\nrequirements or prohibitions are or could be imposed by or under that Order.\n42. The Applicant, as site owner, is a “responsible person” within the meaning of Article\n3 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (“the 2005 Order”) of premises\n5\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\ndefined by Articles 1 and 6 (this excludes domestic premises as defined in Article 2:\n“domestic premises” means premises occupied as a private dwelling (including\nany garden, yard, garage, outhouse, or other appurtenance of such premises\nwhich is not used in common by the occupants of more than one such dwelling;”).\nAs such, it is required to take measures as “general fire precautions” under Article 6,\ndefined in Article 4. It is required to carry out a fire risk assessment (Article 9) and\ntake specific action to minimise the risk of fire in the common parts. Having\nidentified the general fire precautions that are necessary and, having\nimplemented them, the responsible person must put in place a suitable system of\nmaintenance and ensure that equipment is maintained in an efficient state, in\neffective working order and in good repair (Article 17).\n43. Article 4 defines “general fire precautions” as follows:\n4.—(1) In this Order “general fire precautions” in relation to premises means,\nsubject to paragraph (2)—\n(a) measures to reduce the risk of fire on the premises and the risk of the spread\nof fire on the premises;\n(b) measures in relation to the means of escape from the premises;\n(c) measures for securing that, at all material times, the means of escape can be\nsafely and effectively used;\n(d) measures in relation to the means for fighting fires on the premises;\n(e) measures in relation to the means for detecting fire on the premises and\ngiving warning in case of fire on the premises; and\n(f) measures in relation to the arrangements for action to be taken in the event\nof fire on the premises, including—\n(i) measures relating to the instruction and training of employees; and\n(ii) measures to mitigate the effects of the fire.\n44. Under the 2005 Order, the Applicant is required to get rid of or reduce the risk\nfrom fire as far as is reasonably possible and provide general fire precautions\nto deal with any possible risk left.\n45. Although Mr Sunderland said that there had been a risk assessment, he showed no\ngreater understanding of the duties required under the 2005 Order. Nor does the\nTribunal agree with Mr Sunderland that fire safety is not an issue capable of being\nan ‘other factor’ of sufficient weight to outweigh the presumption in the context of\nthe statutory scheme as a whole (see Vyse v Wyldecrest Parks (Management)\nLimited above).\n46. That being said, there was before the Tribunal insufficient evidence for the Tribunal\nto conclude that there was here a real safety issue. Nevertheless, where people’s\nsafety is involved, the Tribunal believes it is incumbent upon a site owner who\nremoves fire-fighting equipment to communicate its reasons for doing so to\n6\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\nresidents of the site so that they can be assured that the Applicant’s duties under the\n2005 Order are being properly met.\n47. The other relevance of the removal of the cabinet and extinguishers and their\nreplacement with a stuck-on notice is whether this reflects a deterioration in the\ncondition, or a decrease in the amenity, of the site or any adjoining land which is\noccupied or controlled by the owner since the date on which this paragraph came\ninto force (in so far as regard has not previously been had to that deterioration or\ndecrease for the purposes of this sub-paragraph).\n48. There was no evidence before the Tribunal such as to show that the condition of the\nfire-fighting equipment had deteriorated since 26 May 2013, the date the above sub-\nparagraph came into force. Nor was there evidence as to whether this issue had ever\nbeen the subject of regard at an earlier review or whether there was\ndeterioration/decrease following the 2017 review and before the removal. The\nevidence pointed to a long-standing issue of neglect. The removal of a damaged\ncabinet and rusty extinguishers can be seen from one perspective to be an\namelioration, but set off by removal of bricks and the clumsy affixing of a notice to\nthe wall. Certainly, when the Tribunal saw the wall on inspection, there was nothing\nin terms of appearance to suggest an issue of concern as to its condition.\nLoss of Amenity\nThe Respondent\n49. The Respondent raised concerns about steps down to the roadway beyond his pitch\nand lighting.\n50. The Respondent’s pitch is at the bottom end of the site. Beyond the road ending at\nthat point, there is an opening within some bushes/trees leading to a stone set of\nsteps down towards the main road and the town of Bodmin beyond. At the top of\nthe steps is a light.\n51. There are complaints about the steps. They are in a poor state of repair and they are\ndeteriorating. There are leaves and vegetation on the steps. The steps had\ndeteriorated over the years since he moved in in 2000; they were pointed out to the\nprevious site owner and the Applicant. Chunks have been missing for 18 months to\n2 years. The light does not work.\n52. There is no maintenance on site. The second site light atop a pole adjacent to a\nwooden store cupboard on the one-way road system has not worked since half way\nthrough 2015 following a dispute about misuse of electricity.\n53. The only lighting is provided by residents themselves, mostly PIR lighting.\nThe Applicant\n54. The Applicant contended that there was no evidence that the lights were not\nworking. They had been checked 2 weeks ago by the maintenance team and found\nto be working.\n55. The Respondent himself had provided a witness statement saying that the light at\nthe steps had not worked for several years, but had been fixed on 9 May 2018 (the\nRespondent accepted that he had made this statement).\n56. There was no requirement for lights under the site licence. Surrounding roads did\nnot have lights. Most homes have exterior lighting.\n57. There was no requirement for lighting under the 1983 Act.\n58. There was no evidence of deterioration.\nThe Tribunal\n59. The Tribunal notes the Respondent’s assertion that there are no visits by the\nmaintenance team, but this was conflicted by the 3 examples he gave of when the\nmaintenance team had been in attendance.\n7\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\n60. The steps had been referred to in pre-hearing documentation and the lack of\nlighting there. The condition of them was a development at the hearing.\n61. The Tribunal looked at the steps at the inspection in the context of the lighting\nissue. With water pouring down the steps from the roads of the site and the\npresence on the steps of leaves, the Tribunal did not venture down the steps.\n62. There was a steep decline, so that the steps too were steep. There was evidence of\nleaves and other detritus on the steps in this wooded area, but the time is autumn\nend and the weather was foul.\n63. The Tribunal did not see, but would expect and accept that there would be some\ndeterioration of concrete steps over time. There would be a need for maintenance\nand safety in terms of obstruction/slip removals, particularly when considering fire\nescape.\n64. There was, however, no evidence such as allow the Tribunal to conclude that the\ncondition of the steps had deteriorated significantly since 26 May 2013, the date the\nrelevant sub-paragraph came into force. Nor was there evidence as to whether this\nissue had ever been the subject of regard at an earlier review or whether there was\ndeterioration following the 2017 review. The evidence pointed to a long-standing\nissue of concern. The Respondent’s suggestion of a handrail appeared to the\nTribunal to be eminently sensible, but one which would come at a cost to the\nresidents and would require discussions with the Applicant. The Applicant will also\nneed to reflect upon any liability for slip injuries if it can be shown that a lack of\nmaintenance is a contributory factor.\n65. So far as the light above the steps is concerned, the inspection was in daylight and\nthe light was not then operative. This has clearly been a long-standing issue.\n66. The evidence of Mr Sunderland at the inspection was not comforting. He told the\nTribunal first that the area beyond the tree line beyond the Respondent’s home was\nnot part of the site (he did not repeat this at the hearing), but it was clear to the\nTribunal that the site did extend beyond the tree line. Part of the Respondent’s\npitch went beyond the tree line and the light maintained by the Applicant was also\nbeyond that line. There was no site plan available.\n67. Mr Sunderland told the Tribunal at the inspection that the light was powered by\nsunlight, but it was obvious to the Tribunal that the lamp was wired.\n68. The Tribunal also saw the second light atop the pole toward the top end of the site.\nAgain, the inspection was in daylight and the light was not then operative. This light\nhas clearly too been a long-standing issue.\n69. Even on the evidence of the Respondent, at some time each of the lights had been\noperative.\n70. Mr Sunderland provided the Tribunal with a signed witness statement from Graham\nThomas Bailey, Senior Licensing Compliance Officer and Safety Officer with\nCornwall Council, of 28 June 2018. In that statement, Mr Bailey detailed a visit to\nthe site at approximately 0630 on 7 February 2018 and could find no street lighting\nat that time. He does not say, however, whether he went beyond the tree line or\nclose to the position where the light is atop the pole at the top end of the site.\n71. The evidence, therefore, for the 2 lights was, as detailed, very mixed. There was no\nsatisfactory evidence such as to allow the Tribunal to conclude that the condition of\nthe lights had deteriorated significantly since 26 May 2013, the date the relevant\nsub-paragraph came into force. Nor was there evidence as to whether this issue had\never been the subject of regard at an earlier review or whether there was\ndeterioration/decrease following the 2017 review. The evidence pointed to a long-\nstanding issue of concern.\n8\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\nOverhanging Trees\nThe Respondent\n72. The Respondent raised concern about an overhanging tree to a corner pitch at the\ntop end of the site. Also, he said, there was a need for maintenance because of the\npresence of overhead cables.\n73. In the past, he had had cutting down performed to a tree overhanging his pitch by\nthe council when the then owner neglected to take action. He had had trees near his\nproperty trimmed in 2017.\nThe Applicant\n74. The Applicant said that there was no evidence of a worsening of the situation in the\nperiod in question.\n75. So far as the corner pitch was concerned, there had been no complaint by the\nresident there and he had paid his pitch fee. The Applicant’s responsibility related to\nthe communal part.\nThe Tribunal\n76. The Tribunal could not see an obvious issue with the corner plot tree. There was\nsome evidence of some trees overhanging one of the roads in the park, but no\nobvious resultant problems associated with it.\n77. There was no evidence of deterioration.\n78. The Tribunal saw no evidence of danger caused by proximity to wiring.\nConclusion\n79. The Tribunal has considered the competing arguments of the parties against the\nfactual matrix it has found and detailed above in paragraphs 26 to 78.\n80. For the purposes of the 1983 Act, the issue is not the actual condition of the park,\nnor indeed the actual amenity of the park. While the Tribunal might accept that the\npark has not always been maintained to a standard which the Respondent might\nreasonably expect, it has to consider whether there has been any\ndeterioration/decrease in the condition or amenity of the park in the relevant period\nand, if it did so find, whether it would thereby be unreasonable for the pitch fees to\nbe increased on the basis of the agreed increase in the retail prices index.\n81. The Tribunal does not find though that any deterioration/decrease associated with\nthe relevant period has been shown measurably to have deteriorated/decreased the\ncondition or amenity of the park.\n82. Accordingly the Tribunal does not find there has been a deterioration in the\ncondition or decrease of the amenity of the park or, if it is wrong about that, any\nminimal decrease is such that it is nevertheless not unreasonable for the pitch fees\nto be increased on the basis of the agreed increase in the retail prices index. The\nTribunal, therefore, orders that increase, effective from 13 August 2018.\n83. Regarding the fire extinguisher issue, there was before the Tribunal insufficient\nevidence for the Tribunal to conclude that there was a real safety issue, which could\nconstitute a factor of sufficient weight to outweigh the presumption in the context of the\nstatutory scheme (the 1983 Act) as a whole.\n84. Whilst taking particular account of the issues required of it, the Tribunal has taken\naccount of the totality of the evidence before it and finds in favour of the Applicant\nfor reasons which it has detailed above.\n9\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\nCosts\n85. The Tribunal heard from Mr Sunderland that he intended to make an application\nfor costs, but he would detail this when he had seen this Decision.\nA Cresswell (Judge)\nAPPEAL\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) must\nseek permission to do so by making written application to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nRegional office which has been dealing with the case.\n2.

The\nreasons for refusing permission follow:\n1. The Tribunal has a duty to give effect to the overriding objective within\nthe Rules when exercising any power under the Rules. The Tribunal is\nrequired to deal with a case fairly and justly, which includes seeking flexibility\nand dealing with cases in a way which is proportionate to the anticipated costs\nand resources of the parties and of the Tribunal.\n2. The Tribunal first considered, under Rule 55 of the Rules, whether to\nreview its decision. It determined not to review its decision because it was not\nsatisfied that any of the grounds of appeal was likely to be successful for the\nreasons detailed within the Decision.\n3. The Respondents raised issues in their application.\n4. The application makes further reference to the issue of the site licence.\nAn email from Gregory Martin, Cornwall Council’s Environmental Protection\nand Licensing Compliance Manager, of 30 January 2019, provides further\ndetail. Even further detail is attached to the Respondents’ submissions to the\nTribunal in response to the Applicant’s application for costs. From the email\nand subsequent documentation, it appears that (the Tribunal here using the\nterms from the Decision) the correct licence was transferred to the Applicant\non 9 January 2015. That licence was later, after the pitch fee review notice of\n13 July 2018, on 10 August 2018, transferred to Wyldecrest Parks (West) Ltd.\nA new, and separate, licence was “grant”ed to Wyldecrest Parks (West) Ltd on\n11 October 2018, such that there were, apparently, then two licences held by\nWyldecrest Parks (West) Ltd for the site. The latter licence comes with its\nown set of conditions, but Mr Martin’s email makes clear that the conditions\nhave yet to be determined and also states that “Once issued there will be 2\nlicences in force for the site” (as does a further email from Mr Martin of 12\nFebruary 2019), which causes some doubt as to whether the second licence\nhas been granted or is yet to be granted and what its conditions might be if\nand when it is granted. The Tribunal remains satisfied, given the above, that\nit has correctly determined the available evidence relating to the site licence.\n5. The \"park licence issue\" had been apparent from the Hearing Bundle.\nIt was detailed in the bundle of documents submitted for the hearing. The\nRespondents point to new evidence on the issue, but it is evidence that would\nhave been available to the Respondents prior to the hearing and could have\nbeen obtained with reasonable diligence by the Respondents for use at the\nhearing. The Tribunal reminds itself of the tests recommended by the Court\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019\n2\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\nof Appeal in Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489. The Tribunal has not\ntaken this additional evidence into account when determining this\napplication, but sets out its thoughts above so that a reader of this Decision\ncan have a clearer view of the issue and the impact of the Ladd v Marshall\nprinciples.\nLadd v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489, [1954] 3 All ER 745, Denning LJ held\nthat there were three principles to be applied to an application to adduce fresh\nevidence on appeal:\n• it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained\nwith reasonable diligence for use at the trial;\n• that the evidence would probably have an important influence on\nthe result of the case; and\n• the evidence must be credible, though it need not be\nincontrovertible.\n6. Much of what the Respondents say in their application is simply a\nrecitation of why they disagree with the Tribunal’s Decision. The Tribunal can\nonly make a Decision on the basis of the evidence placed before it by the\nparties.\n7. The Respondents raise two issues of procedure.\n8. The Respondents say that their understanding is that when a site visit is\ncarried out, the Applicant and Respondent are not allowed to accompany the\nTribunal members around the site. “Mr D Sunderland was with them the\nhole of there visit but I was not allowed due to the weather condition and\nthey wanted to get it over and done with”.\n9. In the experience of this Tribunal, inspections are, on the vast majority\nof occasions, conducted in the presence of the parties.\n10. The Tribunal members arrived separately at the park and only Mr\nSunderland was found at the entrance at the top of the park. He told the\nTribunal that he had been on to the park and had not seen the Respondents.\nThis was the first time that the Tribunal had met Mr Sunderland or visited the\npark. The Tribunal walked down towards the Respondents’ house, directed\nthere by Mr Sunderland, and looked at relevant features on the way down. The\nTribunal specifically told Mr Sunderland that it would not be taking evidence\nfrom him until the hearing. The Tribunal took a number of photographs as an\naide memoire.\n11. The Tribunal members got to the home of the Respondents, who wished\nto remain inside with Mr Hassall. The Tribunal was not at all surprised that\nMr Dudley remained within his home, given the very serious medical\nconditions he suffers from (see the next paragraph). They told the occupants\nof the home what they had seen and asked did they want the Tribunal to look\nat anything else. Mr Dudley told the Tribunal that he wanted it to look at the\nwall where the fire extinguishers had been sited and at the light at the\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019\n3\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nCase Reference:\nboundary; it was only at the hearing that he raised the issue of damaged steps.\nThe Tribunal at no time said or suggested that it was in a hurry to leave.\n12. The application also says: “I feel that the Tribunal seemed to rush\nthrough this hearing and there were issues that were not fully looked at.”\nThe Tribunal noted that the Respondents were represented by Mr Stephen\nHassall of IPHAS (Independent Park Home Advisory Service) at the hearing\n(but that they themselves have apparently produced the appeal application).\nA medical report in the hearing bundle by Dr Emma Langstaff and dated 17\nOctober 2018 detailed numerous serious health issues for Mr Dudley and\nreported that he felt unable to represent himself. The Tribunal was, naturally,\nanxious not to place Mr Dudley in a position of further stress and told him\nthat he could have a break at any time he wished.\n13. The Tribunal was careful to examine all of the issues raised by the\nRespondents in some detail, even those which the Respondents subsequently\nconceded were not relevant to the issues to be decided by the Tribunal, and\nnotwithstanding submissions by Mr Sunderland of lack of relevance when the\nissues were raised initially.\n14. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal specifically checked with\nboth Mr Sunderland and Mr Hassall that they had been able to say all that\nthey wished. Both agreed that they had been able to say all that they wished to\nsay. That was recorded in the Tribunal’s Decision.\n15. The issues raised by the Respondents, whilst clearly of personal\nimportance, are not of general public importance such as to justify the cost of\nan appeal hearing where there is no realistic prospect of the appeal being\nsuccessful.\n16. The Tribunal does not accept that there is a reasonable prospect that\nthe Upper Tribunal will find that the Tribunal has wrongly interpreted or\napplied the relevant law (Fairhold Mercury Limited v HQ (Block 1)\nAction Management Company Limited (2013) UKUT 0487 (LC)) or that\nthe Decision is fairly open to challenge.\n16. The Tribunal concluded that the Respondents ought not to be given\npermission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.\n17. In accordance with section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement\nAct 2007 and Rule 21 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) (Lands\nChamber) Rules 2010 the Applicant/Respondent may make a further\napplication for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber.\nSuch application must be made in writing and received by the Upper Tribunal\n(Lands Chamber) no later than 14 days after the date on which the First-tier\nTribunal sent notice of this refusal to the party applying for permission.\nA Cresswell (Judge)\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019\n4"

The Applicant has made an application for its costs in the proceedings and for\nreimbursement of fees paid by it for his application under Mobile Homes Act\n1983. This Decision must be read in the light of and as following the Tribunal’s\nearlier Decision of 11 January 2019 (“the substantive Decision”). The Tribunal\nhas retained the same names for the parties in this Decision, i.e. the\nRespondents being Mr W R J Dudley and Ms M A Fletcher and the Applicant\nbeing Wyldecrest Parks (Management) Ltd.\nThe Law\n2. Rule 13 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013 reads, so far as is relevant, as follows:\n(1) The Tribunal may make an order in respect of costs only\n(b) if a person has acted unreasonably in bringing, defending or\nconducting proceedings in——\n(ii) a residential property case; or\n(iii) a leasehold case;\n(2) The Tribunal may make an order requiring a party to reimburse to any\nother party the whole or part of the amount of any fee paid by the other\nparty which has not been remitted by the Lord Chancellor.\n(3) The Tribunal may make an order under this rule on an application or\non its own initiative.\n(4) A person making an application for an order for costs—\n(a) must, unless the application is made orally at a hearing, send or\ndeliver an application to the Tribunal and to the person against whom the\norder is sought to be made; and\n(b) may send or deliver together with the application a schedule of the\ncosts claimed in sufficient detail to allow summary assessment of such\ncosts by the Tribunal.\n(5) An application for an order for costs may be made at any time during\nthe proceedings but must be made within 28 days after the date on which\nthe Tribunal sends——\n(a) a decision notice recording the decision which finally disposes of all\nissues in the proceedings; or\n(b) notice of consent to a withdrawal under rule 22 (withdrawal) which\nends the proceedings.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019 2\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\n(6) The Tribunal may not make an order for costs against a person (the\n“paying person”) without first giving that person an opportunity to make\nrepresentations.\n(7) The amount of costs to be paid under an order under this rule may be\ndetermined by——\n(a) summary assessment by the Tribunal;\n(b) agreement of a specified sum by the paying person and the person\nentitled to receive the costs (the “receiving person”);\n(c) detailed assessment of the whole or a specified part of the costs\n(including the costs of the assessment) incurred by the receiving person by\nthe Tribunal or, if it so directs, on an application to a county court; and\nsuch assessment is to be on the standard basis or, if specified in the costs\norder, on the indemnity basis.\n(8) The Civil Procedure Rules 1998(a), section 74 (interest on judgment\ndebts, etc) of the County Courts Act 1984(b) and the County Court\n(Interest on Judgment Debts) Order 1991(c) shall apply, with necessary\nmodifications, to a detailed assessment carried out under paragraph (7)(c)\nas if the proceedings in the Tribunal had been proceedings in a court to\nwhich the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 apply.\n(9) The Tribunal may order an amount to be paid on account before the\ncosts or expenses are assessed.\nThe Application and Response\n3. The application by the Applicant for costs has been considered, accordingly,\non the basis of whether the Applicant had acted unreasonably, in\naccordance with Rule 13(1)(b) above, in bringing, defending or\nconducting proceedings.\n4. The Applicant’s application was received by the Tribunal by letter of 12\nFebruary 2019. It was accompanied by documents to support the sums it\nclaimed.\n5. The Respondents were given an opportunity to respond to the application for\ncosts and did so in a letter of 4 March 2019, received by the Tribunal on 6\nMarch 2019, which was accompanied by documents to support the\nRespondents’ arguments.\n6. Both parties were invited to indicate whether they were willing for the\nTribunal to make its Decision without a hearing and neither party requested a\nhearing.\nThe Applicant\n7. The Applicant referred to Rule 13 and sought costs and a reimbursement of its\nfee.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019 3\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\n8. The Applicant stated that this was the second Tribunal application, the first\nhaving been a dispute as to the date of review of the pitch fee. At that time,\nthe Respondent had submitted that he had not disputed the pitch fee amount\nbut simply the review date.\n9. The Respondents raised a number of issues said to reduce the amenity of the\nsite. He was successful in relation to none of those issues and the Applicant\ndetails the evidence in relation to those issues.\n10. At the hearing, he accepted that display of an incorrect park licence could not\nhave a bearing on the level of fee. It is unreasonable to force a party to issue an\napplication, which is then immediately conceded or raise issues for which no\nevidence is produced.\n11. The evidence of the Respondents was inconsistent about lighting and lack of\nmaintenance. While he may have been confused, it is submitted that Mr\nDudley was not entirely honest and unreasonably made false allegations based\non his dislike of the Applicant to try to influence the Tribunal.\n12. The onus was on the Respondents to make their case.\n13. The Applicant has been put to wasted time, travel and expense.\n14. Attempts by the Applicant to resolve the matter led to accusation of blackmail\nwhen trying to do so. The Respondents’ response has been hostile and\nuncompromising.\nThe Respondents\n15. The Respondents asserted that the Applicant had provided an incorrect site\nlicence to the Tribunal as a deliberate and dishonest ploy.\n16. It was the Applicant, not the Respondents, who acted unreasonably. It was its\nfirst pitch review form which started the problems.\n17. The travel costs are an attempt to recover costs from the first Tribunal case.\n18. The concerns about the wall and steps and the light above the steps were real.\nThe Tribunal did not inspect properly. The Applicant was aware of the light\nproblem.\n19. Mr Sunderland was not truthful about receiving the site licence.\n20. The site licence was held by a different company, Wyldecrest Parks (West)\nLtd, at the time of the hearing.\n21. There has been a history of non-repair of the lights. Mr Dudley has been\nmisquoted about this.\n22. Mr Dudley was not dishonest. The Applicant did not do due diligence when\nacquiring the site and started the problems by not using the correct review\ndate and the correct documentation.\n23. There is a problem with the trees.\n24. The Respondents repeat their reasons for challenging the fee increase.\n25. The correct site licence is still not displayed 4 years after the Applicant\nacquired the park.\n26. Although Mr Hassall conceded that a failure to display the correct licence was\nnot a factor capable of influencing the quantum of the review, it is a big issue.\nConsideration by the Tribunal\n27. The Tribunal considered the application by the Applicant for costs on the basis\nthat the Respondents had acted unreasonably.\n28. The Tribunal reminds itself that this jurisdiction is generally a “no costs”\njurisdiction. By contrast with the County Court, residential property tribunals\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019 4\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nare designed to be “a largely costs-free environment”: (1) Union Pension\nTrustees Ltd, (2) Mr Paul Bliss v Mrs Maureen Slavin [2015] UKUT\n0103 (LC).\n29. In Harris v Academies Enterprise Trust & Ors UKEAT/0097/14/KN,\nMr J Langstaff: Even if the Employment Tribunal is not in the same\nposition as the civil courts because there is no cost-shifting regime, it was\ndesigned as a cost-free forum in so far as party-and-party costs were\nconcerned. That is true of most Tribunals; it is a particular feature of most\nTribunals.\n30. In Willow Court Management Company (1985) Limited v Alexander\n(2016) UKUT 0290 (LC), the following advice was given:\n“At the first stage the question is whether a person has acted unreasonably. A\ndecision that the conduct of a party has been unreasonable does not involve\nan exercise of discretion but rather the application of an objective standard\nof conduct to the facts of the case.\nIf there is no reasonable explanation for the conduct complained of, the\nbehaviour will properly be adjudged to be unreasonable, and the threshold\nfor the making of an order will have been crossed.”\n“At the second stage it is essential for the Tribunal to consider whether, in the\nlight of the unreasonable conduct it has found to have been demonstrated, it\nought to make an order for costs or not” “the nature, seriousness and effect of\nthe unreasonable conduct will be an important part of the material to be\ntaken into account”\n“The only general rules are found in section 29(2)-(3) of the 2007 Act,\nnamely that “the relevant tribunal shall have full power to determine by\nwhom and to what extent the costs are to be paid”, subject to the tribunal’s\nprocedural rules. Pre-eminent amongst those rules, of course, is the\noverriding objective in rule 3, which is to enable the tribunal to deal with\ncases fairly and justly. This includes dealing with the case “in ways which\nare proportionate to the importance of the case, the complexity of the issues,\nthe anticipated costs and the resources of the parties and of the Tribunal.”\nbut other circumstances will clearly also be relevant...”\nWhen considering the order to make, there is no need to show that the\nunreasonable conduct caused any identifiable loss on the part of the innocent\nparty: see paras 40-41. The order need not be confined to the\ncosts: “attributable to the unreasonable conduct”.\n“…[Applications] should be determined summarily, preferably without the\nneed for a further hearing, and after the parties have had the opportunity to\nmake submissions. We consider that submissions are likely to be better\nframed in the light of the tribunal’s decision, rather than in anticipation of it,\nand applications made at interim stages or before the decision is available\nshould not be encouraged. The applicant for an order should be required to\nidentify clearly and specifically the conduct relied on as unreasonable, and if\nthe tribunal considers that there is a case to answer (but not otherwise) the\nrespondent should be given the opportunity to respond to the criticisms made\nand to offer any explanation or mitigation.”\n“A decision to dismiss such an application can be explained briefly. A\ndecision to award costs need not be lengthy and the underlying dispute can\nbe taken as read. The decision should identify the conduct which the tribunal\nhas found to be unreasonable, list the factors which have been taken into\naccount in deciding that it is appropriate to make an order, and record the\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019 5\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nfactors taken into account in deciding the form of the order and the sum to be\npaid.”\n“The behaviour of an unrepresented party with no legal knowledge should be\njudged by the standards of a reasonable person who does not have legal\nadvice. The crucial question is always whether, in all the circumstances of the\ncase, the party has acted unreasonably in the conduct of the proceedings.”\n“When exercising the discretion conferred by rule 13(1)(b) the tribunal should\nhave regard to all of the relevant facts known to it, including any mitigating\ncircumstances, but without either “excessive indulgence” or allowing the\nabsence of representation to become an excuse for unreasonable conduct.”\nIn Cannon v 38 Lambs Conduit LLP (2016) UKUT371 (LC), the Upper\nTribunal said: “The point has been made time and again that the F-tT’s\nresidential property jurisdiction is essentially a no costs jurisdiction, or to\nput it another way, ‘a costs shifting jurisdiction by exception only and parties\nmust usually expect to bear their own costs’ (see Willow Court\nManagement Co v Alexander [2016] UKUT 290 (LC) at [62].) It is\ntherefore understandable why the F-tT decided not to make a costs order\nagainst the tenants although the landlord had largely succeeded at first\ninstance.”\n31. In Marcus J Staples v Danute Liuba Cranfield [2018] UKUT 341 (LC),\nthe Tribunal found as follows:\nA “leasehold case” to which this power applies is any case in respect of which\nthe FTT has jurisdiction under any of the enactments specified in section\n176A(2) of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002.\nIf a tribunal makes an order and the party against whom it is made\nunreasonably fails or refuses to comply with that order, then in my view this\nact (namely the act of omission by failing to comply) can properly be\ndescribed as an act done in defending or conducting proceedings.\nIf a party against whom an order was made subsequently, every time\ncomplaint was made that the party had failed to comply with the order,\nwrote back saying that they refused to comply with the order and thereby\ngenerated the need for a further application to be made for the purpose of\nenforcing the order, then such a party could properly be said to be acting\nunreasonably in defending or conducting proceedings.\nIf a party, instead of writing back setting out a refusal to comply, merely\nignores the order and does nothing then equally such party could properly be\nsaid to be acting unreasonably in defending or conducting proceedings.\n32. The Tribunal has had regard to the word \"unreasonably.\" The test is whether\nthe behaviour permits of reasonable explanation: HH Judge Huskinson in\nHalliard Property Company Limited and Belmont Hall and Elm\nCourt RTM Company Limited LRX/130/2007 LRA/85/2008. In\nRidehalgh v Horsfield (1994) 3 All ER 848, Bingham LJ said:\n“Unreasonable’ also means what it has been understood to mean in this\ncontext for at least half a century. The expression aptly describes conduct\nwhich is vexatious, designed to harass the other side rather than advance the\nresolution of the case, and it makes no difference that the conduct is the\nproduct of excessive zeal and not improper motive. But conduct cannot be\ndescribed as unreasonable simply because it leads in the event to an\nunsuccessful result or because other more cautious legal representatives\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019 6\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\nwould have acted differently. The acid test is whether the conduct permits of\na reasonable explanation. If so, the course adopted may be regarded as\noptimistic and as reflecting on a practitioner’s judgement, but it is not\nunreasonable”.\n33. The Tribunal commenced a two-stage approach. First to find whether the\nRespondents acted unreasonably and then, if it so found, to exercise its\ndiscretion whether to order costs having regard to all of the circumstances,\nincluding the Tribunal’s overriding objective.\n34. The Tribunal examined the submissions of the Applicant which it has detailed\nabove. It concentrated only upon those assertions which could have relevance\nto the issue in the preceding paragraph.\n35. The Respondents were entitled to challenge the pitch fee. The Respondents\nwere entitled to ask the Tribunal to consider issues which could affect the\nquantum of the pitch fee; in the event, the Tribunal has determined that the\npitch fee was properly demanded.\n36. The Tribunal viewed the Respondents as not being lawyers, but rather legally\nunrepresented persons with very limited knowledge. Some of Mr Dudley’s\nsubmissions added to the basis for this conclusion.\n37. Whilst it is true that none of the issues raised by the Respondents led to a\nsuccessful conclusion, they were entitled to make them.\n38. The removal of the fire-fighting equipment by the Applicant was a serious\nissue worthy of consideration and the Tribunal found against the Applicant’s\nsubmission that the issue could have no relevance to the pitch fee.\n39. Mr Dudley was mostly polite, as was Mr Sunderland. These were not two old\nfriends coming to detail a shared version of events and adverse comments\nwere made by both sides.\n40. Whilst Mr Dudley was not always factually correct to say as he did, the\nTribunal did not conclude that he was telling deliberate untruths. Similarly,\nthe Tribunal did not conclude that Mr Sunderland was being deliberately\nuntruthful when describing the lower park boundary at the inspection.\n41. A failure to provide evidence to support a contention must be seen as being in\nthe opposing party’s favour and, in the absence of obvious malice, cannot be\nseen as unreasonable.\n42. The Tribunal finds that the Respondents have not acted unreasonably in\nbringing, defending or conducting proceedings.\nFees\n43. In Cannon v 38 Lambs Conduit LLP (2016) UKUT371 (LC), the Upper\nTribunal ordered the reimbursement of fees where the tenants have succeeded\non the principal substantive issue.\n“Reimbursement of fees does not require the applicant to prove unreasonable\nconduct on the part of an opponent. It is a matter for the tribunal to decide\nupon in the exercise of its discretion, and (as with costs orders) the tribunal\nmay make such an order on an application being made or on its own\ninitiative.”\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019 7\n\nCHI/OOHE/PHI/2018/0232\n44. Whilst the test to be applied under Rule 13(2) requires no analysis of whether\na person has acted unreasonably, when all that is recorded above is weighed in\nthe balance, the Tribunal finds that it would be appropriate to order the\nRespondents to reimburse the Applicant with the fees paid by it. There\nappears to the Tribunal to have been no other viable option open to the\nApplicant to resolve the issues save by making its application to the Tribunal.\nThe Respondents are ordered to pay the sum of £20 to the Applicant in\nreimbursement of fees.\nA Cresswell (Judge)\nAPPEAL\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application to the First-\ntier Tribunal at the Regional office which has been dealing with the case.\n2. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after the Tribunal\nsends to the person making the application written reasons for the decision.\n3. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time limit,\nthe person shall include with the application for permission to appeal a request for an\nextension of time and the reason for not complying with the 28-day time limit; the\nTribunal will then decide whether to extend time or not to allow the application for\npermission to appeal to proceed.\n4. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal, and state the result the party\nmaking the application is seeking.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019 8"

This is an application for dispensation from the consultation requirements\nof S.20 Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. (the 1985 Act)\n2. The Applicant states that “The qualifying works are following a leak from\nthe roof which has caused a lot of damage into the property. I have\nattached the email in relation to it. A surveyor is looking into the extent of\nthe works.\n3. In answer to the question regarding what consultation had been carried\nout the Applicant stated “The extent of the works is being carried out by a\nsurveyor”\n4. The reason for the application was said to be “Works need to be carried out\nas soon as possible as flooding was caused to the property via a leaking\nroof which caused water to enter the electrics so is a cause of concern over\nsafety”\n5. The email referred to in paragraph 2 was not included with the\nApplication.\n6. The Tribunal made Directions on 9 November 2018 which required the\nApplicant to send to each Respondent a copy of the application and the\nDirections together with a form to be returned to the Tribunal indicating\nwhether the application was agreed with, whether a written statement was\nto be sent to the applicant and whether an oral hearing was required.\n7. The Tribunal received an objection to the Application from one lessee who\npointed out that, contrary to the Tribunal’s Directions the copy email\nreferred to above had not been provided.\n8. In accordance with Directions the remaining lessees have been removed as\nRespondents.\n9. Following service of a Notice that the Tribunal was minded to strike out\nthe application due to the failure to comply with the Tribunal’s Directions\na copy of an email trail was received from the Applicant\n10. This comprised an email from Mr Hentschel of Hallas & Co dated 20\nAugust 2018 asking a building contractor to quote for remedial works to a\nleaking roof. A reply dated 21 August 2018 suggested that rather than\nquote “if the works are below £5k we just get on and do it”. Authorisation\nto proceed was duly given by the Applicant on 23 August 2018.\n11. A copy of the email trail was sent to the Lessee referred to above on 27\nNovember 2018 with a request that he advised the Tribunal within 7 days\nwhether he wished to pursue his application that the application be\nreserved.\n12. No request has been received.\n13. The only issue for the Tribunal is if it is reasonable to dispense with any\nstatutory consultation requirements. This decision does not concern\n2\n\nthe issue of whether any service charge costs will be reasonable\nor payable.\nThe Law\n14. The relevant section of the Act reads as follows:\n20ZA Consultation requirements:\na. (1) Where an application is made to a Leasehold Valuation Tribunal\nfor a determination to dispense with all or any of the consultation\nrequirements in relation to any qualifying works or qualifying long-\nterm agreement, the Tribunal may make the determination if\nsatisfied that it is reasonable to dispense with the requirements.\n15. The matter was examined in some detail by the Supreme Court in the case\nof Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson. In summary the Supreme Court\nnoted the following\nb. The main question for the Tribunal when considering how to\nexercise its jurisdiction in accordance with section 20ZA (1) is the\nreal prejudice to the tenants flowing from the landlord’s breach of\nthe consultation requirements.\nc. The financial consequence to the landlord of not granting a\ndispensation is not a relevant factor. The nature of the landlord is\nnot a relevant factor.\nd. Dispensation should not be refused solely because the landlord\nseriously breached, or departed from, the consultation\nrequirements.\ne. The Tribunal has power to grant a dispensation as it thinks fit,\nprovided that any terms are appropriate.\nf. The Tribunal has power to impose a condition that the landlord\npays the tenants’ reasonable costs (including surveyor and/or legal\nfees) incurred in connection with the landlord’s application under\nsection 20ZA (1).\ng. The legal burden of proof in relation to dispensation applications is\non the landlord. The factual burden of identifying some “relevant”\nprejudice that they would or might have suffered is on the tenants.\nh. The court considered that “relevant” prejudice should be given a\nnarrow definition; it means whether non-compliance with the\nconsultation requirements has led the landlord to incur costs in an\nunreasonable amount or to incur them in the provision of services,\nor in the carrying out of works, which fell below a reasonable\nstandard, in other words whether the non-compliance has in that\nsense caused prejudice to the tenant.\ni. The more serious and/or deliberate the landlord's failure, the more\nreadily a Tribunal would be likely to accept that the tenants had\nsuffered prejudice.\nj. Once the tenants had shown a credible case for prejudice, the\nTribunal should look to the landlord to rebut it.\nEvidence\n16. A bundle has been provided extending to 202 pages. It includes a brief\nstatement of case containing the same information as in the application\n3\n\nform, a 157 page specification of works dated August 2018 and prepared by\nHallas & Co entitled External & Internal Repairs and Decorations, an\ninvoice from the OlliGroup dated 10 September 2018 entitled “Roof\nWorks” and referring to “carrying out works as per our estimate and your\nvalued instructions”\n17. The email trail referred to at paragraph 10 above was also included.\nDetermination\n18. For the Tribunal to grant dispensation from the consultation requirements\nof Section 20 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 in respect of works\nthere has to be clarity as to the nature of those works.\n19. The statement of case gives no more information than the application form\nand, despite the substantial bundle there is no indication as to the\nrelevance of the Schedule of Works referred to at paragraph 16 and\nwhether it is intended to describe the works for which dispensation is\nsought. Clearly the schedule is for a far more extensive project than that\nnow at issue.\n20. Unfortunately the contractor’s invoice sheds no further light on the matter\neither and the Tribunal is simply left to speculate on the nature of the\nworks that have been carried out and for which dispensation is now\nsought.\n21. In these circumstances the Tribunal is not prepared to grant the\ndispensation required.\n22. The Tribunal therefore refuses dispensation from the\nconsultation requirements of S.20 Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985.\nD Banfield FRICS\n6 December 2018\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application to\nthe First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office, which has been dealing with\nthe case. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28 days after\nthe Tribunal sends to the person making the application written reasons\nfor the decision.\n2. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time limit,\nthe person shall include with the application for permission to appeal a\nrequest for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the\n28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide whether to extend time or\nnot to allow the application for permission to appeal to proceed.\n3. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\nTribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal and state the result\nthe party making the appeal is seeking.\n4"

A face-to-face hearing\nwas not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be determined\non the papers. The documents that the tribunal were referred to are in the\nreferral, with no bundle or representation from the Landlord. The contents of\nthese documents have been noted. The order made is described below.\n© CROWN COPYRIGHT\n1\n\nBackground\n1. On 17th September 2021, the tenant referred to the Tribunal a notice of\nincrease of rent served by the landlord under section 13 of the Housing Act\n1988.\n2. The landlord's notice, dated 2nd February 2021 proposed a rent, inclusive of\nservice charge and arrears of £149.85 per week with effect from 5th April\n2021. The net rent being identified as £123.45 increasing to £125.30 per week.\n3. The tenancy is a periodic tenancy which commenced on 20th July 1992.\n4. Directions were issued by the tribunal on 26th July 2021.Due to Covid 19\nrestrictions inspections are not generally being undertaken neither party\nrequested a hearing.\n5. Prior to the hearing the Tribunal received no written representations and only\nthe application, Copy of tenancy, notice documentation, an historic invoice\nfrom Extreme Environments and service charge statements.\nThe Evidence\n6. In her application Ms Matthie referred to items of disrepair and faults with the\nproperty including rotten windows and various broken fittings and bathroom\nrequiring upgrade and holes from loft which was allowing mice infestation.\nGenerally, she expressed dissatisfaction with the service provided by the\nLandlord in this regard.\n7. Essentially as a result of poor condition Ms Matthie considers it inappropriate\nthat the rent should be increased at all.\nThe Accommodation\n8. The Tribunal viewed the locality via google street view. It is situated in a\nresidential locality of attractive Victorian bay fronted terraced houses. 17-19\nwere adjacent terraced houses which have been converted into flats. Externally\ndecorations were in a generally fair condition with some paint work in need of\nattention and the roof was showing signs that it may require future attention.\n9. The flat is located on the first floor and has 1 bed room a living room together\nwith a kitchen and Bathroom/WC. Ms Matthie further confirmed that the\nproperty is centrally heated but is single glazed and all carpets, curtains and\nwhite goods have been provided by herself.\n2\n\n10. There are clearly issues between the parties over the quality and amount of\nservice charge payable and also arrears that are being claimed. These matters\nare largely outside of the jurisdiction for the purpose of this application but\nwould comment that it is considered unusual for these items to be included\nwithin the landlord’s notice. It is further noted that Clause (3) of the tenancy\nagreement, as provided, only provides for the recovery of landlord’s services\nfor provision of TV ariel and entry phone, the amount provided for in the\nestimate for 2021/2022 is £0.96.\nThe law\n11. In accordance with the terms of section 14 Housing Act 1988 the Tribunal\nproceeded to determine the rent at which it considered that the subject\nproperty might reasonably be expected to be let on the open market by a\nwilling landlord under an assured tenancy.\n12. In so doing the Tribunal, as required by section 14(1), ignored the effect on the\nrental value of the property of any relevant tenant's improvements as defined\nin section 14(2) of that Act.\nValuation\n13. In coming to its decision, the tribunal had regard to the member’s own general\nknowledge of market rent levels in the area.\n14. Generally, the majority of properties available on the market are of a higher\ndecorative standard than the subject property and adjustment should be made\nto reflect this. It is also likely that floor coverings, curtains and white goods\nwould be provided. The starting point taken for the rent is £280 per week from\nwhich a sum of £112 has been deducted to arrive at a net rent of £168 per\nweek inclusive of a variable service charge of £0.96.\n15. This figure represents a maximum and it is likely, as in this case that social\nlandlords will charge a lesser amount.\nThe decision\n16. The tribunal concluded that the rent at which the property might reasonably be\nexpected to be let on the open market as at the 5th April 2021 £168 per week\ninclusive of £0.96 variable service charge.\nChairman: Mark Taylor MRICS\nDated: 19th January 2021\n__________________________________\nANNEX - RIGHTS OF APPEAL\ni.

A face-to-face hearing was not held because it was not practicable and no\none requested same.\nThe documents the Tribunal were referred to were in a bundle of some 174 pages.\nSummary of the tribunal’s decision\n(1) The appropriate premium payable for the collective\nenfranchisement is £55,200. (Fifty-five thousand and two\nhundred pounds)\nBackground\n1. This is an application made by the applicant qualifying tenants pursuant to\nsection 26 and 27 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Act 1993 (“the Act”) for a determination of the premium to\nbe paid for the collective enfranchisement of 5 Kidderminister Road,\nCroydon, Surrey, CR0 2UF (the “property”) where the Landlord cannot be\nfound.\nThe issues\n2. In the absence of the Landlord there are no matters agreed. The applicants\nhave submitted a valuation report prepared by Andrew Pridell Associates\n(a) The subject property is a semidetached Victorian building over two floors,\nsubsequently converted into two self-contained flats. Construction is traditional\nbrick elevation and butterfly roof. The accommodation comprises ground floor\nentrance hall, servicing both flats. For Flat 1, 67.1 m 2, there is an entrance hall,\nlounge, two double bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom with WC. Outside a section of\nrear garden and communal parking area. For flat 2, 71.24 m2, again two double\nbedrooms, lounge, kitchen and bathroom with WC. Outside a section of rear\ngarden and communal parking.\n(b) The valuation date is 31st January 2022.\n(c) Details of the tenants’ leasehold interests:\n\nFlat 1 and Flat 2 comprise separate leases with identical terms.

The tribunal will consider the evidence on the following\nmatters:\n(d) Capitalisation of ground rent:\n(e) Deferment rate:\n(f) Freehold value\n(g) Development hope value. Nil\n(h) The premium payable.\nThe hearing\n5. The case was dealt with on the papers on 6th April 2022 with the necessary\ndocuments provided in a bundle by the Applicant’s representative.\n6. The tribunal was not asked to inspect the property and the tribunal did not\nconsider it necessary to carry out a physical inspection to make its determination.\n7. The applicant relied upon the expert report and valuation of Paul Martin of\nAndrew Pridell Associates dated 9th March 2022.\nCapitalisation rate\n8. Paul Martin considers that capitalisation rates 6.5% are normal. The rent is\nmodest and reviews are at 33 years apart.\nThe tribunal’s determination\n9. The tribunal determines that the rate to be used is 6.5%.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n\n10. The tribunal notes that a rate of 6.5% has been used in Paul Martin’s\nexperience and in the absence of any specific evidence to show that this should be\nvaried in this case the tribunal will adopt this rate.\nDeferment rate\n11. Paul Martin applies the Sportelli rate of 5%\nThe tribunal’s determination\n12. The tribunal determines that 5% is appropriate as the deferment rate.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n13.

The tribunal determines that the reversionary value of the freehold interest in\nthe ground floor flat no 1 as £277,750, and for the first-floor flat no 2 as £277,750.\nReasons for the tribunal’s determination\n16. The comparable evidence represented in the report supports these figures.\nDevelopment hope value\n17. The tribunal determines that there is no development hope value to be\nincluded in the calculation.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n18. The property is fully utilised by the subject flat and there is no development\npotential.\nAppurtenant land\n\n19. A nominal figure of £50.00 was added for appurtenant land.\nReasons for the tribunal’s decision\n21. The nominal figure is accepted by the tribunal.\nThe premium\n20.

The Applicants have produced an additional bundle which extends\nto 950 pages. Reference to this will be prefixed by \"A.__\"). This includes a\nnumber of photographs. The Applicants have also provided a number of\nvideos. and videos.\n2\n\nIntroduction\n1. The Tribunal is required to determine six applications brought by seven tenants\nwho hold leases at four blocks at Warren Close, Hayes, UB4 0XY who seek a\ndetermination of the payability and reasonableness of the service charges\npursuant to section 27A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (\"the Act\"). The\napplication relates to the sums charged for cyclical works (Issue 1); the service\ncharges for 2023/24 (Issue 2) and the interim service charges payable for\n2024/25 (Issue 3). The service charge accounts for 2024/25 are not yet\navailable.\n2. Warren Close is a development of 24 residential one bedroom flats across five\nblocks. Pentagon House and Welles House have six flats on three floors. Meade\nHouse and Kingfisher House have 4 flats on two floors. The fifth block, with\nwhich the Tribunal is not concerned, is Sovereign House which has four flats.\nAll the tenants pay a service charge of 4.167%.\n3. The development was completed in 1994. The flats originally had wooden sash\nwindows. Northcote Housing Association Limited granted shared ownership\nleases to the tenants. There have been a number of changes in the identity of\nthe landlord. On some unspecified date, Catalyst Housing Ltd (\"Catalyst\")\nacquired the freehold interest. On 1 April 2022, Catalyst became a subsidiary of\nthe Respondent. Four of the tenants have \"staircased up\" and now own 100% of\nthe beneficial interest in their flats. Mr Hoareau is one of these tenants.\n4. The following are parties to this application:\n(i) Mr Nazim Shah (Flat 1 Pentagon House). He acquired his lease in September\n2013.\n(ii) Mr Laurence Hoareau (Flat 2 Pentagon House).\n(iii) Mr Peter Latawiec (Flat 3 Pentagon House).\n(iv) Mr Tiamour Osman (Flat 6 Pentagon House). He acquired the lease in\nOctober 2003. He is a sales engineer. He occupies his flat on his own.\n(v) Mr Carl Jackson (Flat 3 Meade House). He is a special needs teacher. He\noccupies his one bedroom flat with his wife and two children. He acquired his\nflat in August 2014.\n(vi) Mr Gavin Frederick (Flat 4 Kingfisher House).\n(vii) Mr Jeyasingham Puvendran (Flat 5 Welles House). He acquired his lease\nin July 2007. He is a sales engineer. He occupies his flat on his own.\n5. The parties have provided a Scott Schedule (HB.92-114). This raises a total of\n46 service charge items which are challenged. Ms Traynor comments that this\n3\n\nis a \"wholly unhelpful document\" in trying to identify the substance of the\nApplicants' complaints. She has provided a summary of the items challenged\nfor the service charge year 2023/24 and the interim service charge for 2024/25.\nHowever, there are 31 challenges to cyclical works which were carried out\nbetween July and October 2022. Confusion has arisen because the Respondent\ninitially apportioned the costs attributable to the five individual blocks. The\nRespondent then recognised that this was not in accordance with the terms of\nthe leases. The charges were then reissued apportioning the cost of the works\nequally between the 24 flats. However, because of the delays that had occurred,\nthe Respondent recognised that no tenant could be required to pay more; rather\na refund was made to those tenants who had been overcharged.\n6. The three lead tenants, Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau and Mr Jackson, have jointly\nmade a witness statement (at HB.337-344). Mr Hoareau has taken the initiative\npreparing the case for the Applicants. Unfortunately, due to the untimely death\nof his wife, Mr Hoareau was unable to attend the hearing. Her funeral was held\non the first day of the hearing. The tenants were anxious for their application to\nproceed in his absence. Mr Shah, Mr Jackson and Mr Puendran attended the\nhearing and gave evidence on behalf of the Applicants. Mr Osman attended on\nthe second day of the hearing. Mr Shah provided a Skeleton Argument.\n7. Mr Shah complained that it was wrong that tenants who only had a 30% share\nin the equity of their flat, should be required to pay 100% of the service charge.\nThe Tribunal explained that this was the contractual position as provided in the\nlease. Further, it was the standard model for shared ownership leases in\nEngland. If this is considered to be unfair, this is a matter for the Regulator of\nSocial Housing and/or parliament. It is not a matter for this Tribunal.\n8. Ms Katherine Traynor (Counsel) appeared on behalf of the Respondent. She\nwas accompanied by both Ms Mary Walsh and Mr Jordan Corrall from her\ninstructing solicitor, Winkworth Sherwood. She adduced evidence from Ms\nSandraline Kamba, the Respondent's Service Charge Specialist (statement at\nHB.293-303); Ms Samantha Dhanilall, the Respondent's Regional Home\nOwnership Manager for North West London (statement at HB.304-311) and Ms\nSatinder Bedi, the Respondent's Project Manager (statements at HB.688-690\nand HB.312-316). Ms Traynor provided a Skeleton Argument and a Bundle of\n15 authorities.\n9. The Applicants have come together because they are concerned about the level\nof the service charges that they have been required to pay. This has been\ninstigated by the cost of a programme of cyclical repairs. They also complain of\nthe quality of the works. Their attack is unfocussed. Their witness statement\nextends to just 8 pages. Their witness statement does not address the numerous\nphotographs in their bundle of 1,275 pages and the videos which they have\nprovided.\n10. The Applicants are litigants in person. However, they must recognise that they\nmust identify the issues that they require the tribunal to determine and prove\ntheir case as to why the service charges are not payable or are unreasonable.\n4\n\n11. Ms Traynor states that the Respondent's approach has at all times been to\nengage constructively by responding to the Applicants’ queries, providing\ndocumentation, and addressing, within these proceedings, as many of the\npoints made as can practically be achieved. The Respondent approached the\nhearing in the same vein in the hope of a more constructive relationship moving\nforward.\nThe Leases\n12. The Tribunal has been provided with the leases for Flats 1 and Flats 6 Pentagon\nHouse; Flat 3 Meade House; and Flat 4 Kingfisher House. Although the\nTribunal has stated that all tenants are required to pay a service charge of\n4.167%, this is not strictly correct. The lease for Flat 6 Pentagon House specifies\na percentage of 0.04167% and that for 4 Kingfisher House a percentage of\n0.4167%. The parties accepted that these are manifest errors and 4.167% is the\ncorrect percentage for all leases.\n13. The \"Buildings\" are defined as including the five blocks. Thus the 4.167% service\ncharge extends to the costs of repairing, decorating and repairing any of the five\nblocks.\n14. By Clause 3 (2)(c), the Leaseholder covenants to pay the Service Charge in\naccordance with Clause 7. Clause 7 (2) contains a covenant on the part of the\nLeaseholder to pay the Service Charge during the Term by monthly equal\npayments in advance on the first day of each month. The \"Service Charge\" is\ndefined in Clause 7 (1)(d) as the \"Specified Proportion of the Service Provision\".\nThe \"Specified Proportion\" is defined as ‘the proportion specified in the\nParticulars”, namely 4.167%.\n15. Clause 5 sets out the Landlord's covenants. Clause 5(2) is a covenant to insure\nthe Buildings. By Clause 5 (3), the Landlord covenants to maintain, repair and\ndecorate the roof, foundations, main structure of the Buildings, and all external\nparts including the windows and doors (but excluding the glass).\n16. The \"Service Provision\" (by Clause 7 (4)) is calculated by an estimate of the\nexpenditure likely to be incurred in a relevant year together with an amount\ntowards a reserve. Clause 7 (5) provides as follows; \"The relevant expenditure\nto be included in the Service Provision shall comprise all expenditure\nreasonably incurred by the Landlord in connection with the repair,\nmanagement, maintenance and provision of services for the Building…\" and\nincludes specifically the cost of the Landlord’s performance of covenants\ncontained in Clauses 5 (2), 5 (3) and 5 (4). As soon as practicable after the end\nof each Account Year the Landlord determines whether the estimate has\nexceeded or fallen short of the actual expenditure in the Account year (clause 7\n(6)).\nThe Law\n5\n\n17. Section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (“the Act”) defines the concepts\nof “service charge” and “relevant costs”:\n“(1) In the following provisions of this Act “service charge” means an\namount payable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to the\nrent—\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs,\nmaintenance, improvements or insurance or the landlord’s costs\nof management, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to the\nrelevant costs.”\n(2) The relevant costs are the costs or estimate costs incurred or to be\nincurred by or on behalf of the landlord, or a superior landlord, in\nconnection with matters for which the service charge is payable.”\n18. Section 19 gives this Tribunal the jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness\nof any service charge:\n“(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the\namount of a service charge payable for a period—\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the\ncarrying out of works, only if the services or works are of a\nreasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.”\n19. The Supreme Court has recently reviewed the approach that should be adopted\nby tribunals in considering the reasonableness of service charges in Williams v\nAviva Investors Ground Rent GP Ltd [2023] UKSC 6; [2023] 2 WLR 484. Lord\nBriggs JSC (at [14]) recognised that the making of a demand for payment of a\nservice charge will have required the landlord (or manager in this case) first to\nhave made a number of discretionary management decisions. These will include\nwhat works to carry out or services to perform, with whom to contract for their\nprovision and at what price, and how to apportion the aggregate costs among\nthe tenants benefited by the works or services. To some extent the answers to\nthose questions may be prescribed in the lease, for example by way of a\ncovenant by the landlord to provide a list of specified services, or by a fixed\napportionment regime. But even the most rigid and detailed contractual regime\nis likely to leave important decisions to the discretion of the landlord. A landlord\nis contractually obliged to act reasonably. This is subject to this Tribunal’s\n6\n\njurisdiction under the 1985 Act to determine whether the landlord acted\nreasonably (see [33]).\n20. The Tribunal highlights the following passage from the judgment of Martin\nRodger KC, the Deputy President, in Enterprise Home Developments LLP v\nAdam [2020] UKUT 151 (LC) at [28]: \"Much has changed since the Court of\nAppeal’s decision in Yorkbrook v Batten but one important principle remains\napplicable, namely that it is for the party disputing the reasonableness of sums\nclaimed to establish a prima facie case.\"\n21. Section 20 of the Act requires a landlord to consult in respect of and “qualifying\nworks” where the relevant contribution of any tenant will exceed £250. The\nconsultation requirements applicable in the present case are contained in Part\n2 of Schedule 4 to the Service Charge (Consultation Requirements) (England)\nRegulations 2003. A summary of these is set out in the speech of Lord\nNeuberger in Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson [2013] UKSC 14; [2013] 1 WLR\n854 at [12]:\nStage 1: Notice of Intention to do the Works: Notice must be given to each\ntenant and any tenants’ association, describing the works, or saying\nwhere and when a description may be inspected, stating the reasons for\nthe works, specifying where and when observations and nominations for\npossible contractors should be sent, allowing at least 30 days. The\nlandlord must have regard to those observations.\nStage 2: Estimates: The landlord must seek estimates for the works,\nincluding from any nominee identified by any tenants or the association.\nStage 3: Notice about Estimates: The landlord must issue a statement to\ntenants and the association, with two or more estimates, a summary of\nthe observations, and its responses. Any nominee’s estimate must be\nincluded. The statement must say where and when estimates may be\ninspected, and where and by when observations can be sent, allowing at\nleast 30 days. The landlord must have regard to such observations.\n4: Notification of reasons: Unless the chosen contractor is a nominee or\nsubmitted the lowest estimate, the landlord must, within 21 days of\ncontracting, give a statement to each tenant and the association of its\nreasons, or specifying where and when such a statement may be\ninspected.\nThe Background\n22. In 2019, the development was being managed by Catalyst. The time had come\nfor a programme of external repairs and decorations (\"cyclical repairs\"). The\nlandlord arranged for the development to be inspected by Michael Doherty from\nig9 LLP (\"ig9\"). His inspection report, dated 11 January 2019, is at HB.691-722.\nHe noted that the windows were timber framed double glazed sash units. They\n7\n\nwere in a poor condition with chipped and flaking decoration. Numerous\nglazing units had failed. There were isolated areas of wet rot. He recommended\nthat the windows be replaced with new UPVC double glazed units.\n23. On 5 April 2019, Catalyst served a Stage 1 \"Notice of Intention\" on the tenants\n(at HB.595-596). The tenants were notified of the proposal to replace the\nwindows with double glazed UPVC units. Catalyst balloted the tenants on the\npreferred colour on the inside of the new windows. The external face was to be\nbrown as existing. Eleven of the 24 tenants responded to the ballot. On 12\nDecember 2019, Catalyst served a \"Notice of Estimates\". However, this was\nlater withdrawn. Apparently, the tenants were told that the cost of the works\nwould be some £105k (exc VAT).\n24. On 24 February 2020, Catalyst held a meeting with the tenants to discuss a\nnumber of concerns that had been raised. Ms Bedi attended the meeting. The\nminutes of the meeting are at HB.725-727. Tenants were concerned about the\ncost of the works and the payment plan that was being offered. Tenants queried\nwhether it would be possible to install casement, rather than sash, windows.\nThe cost would be lower. Catalyst responded that planning consent had been\nsought for a \"like-for-like\" replacement of sash windows.\n25. On 23 March 2020, the first lockdown was imposed and the works were put on\nhold. On 18 March 2021, Catalyst held a further meeting with tenants by zoom.\nThe minutes are at HB.728-730. Some tenants against repeated their\npreference for casement windows. They again complained about the cost of the\nworks. Catalyst responded that this should have been raised in response to the\nNotice of Intention. The Respondent had proceeded on the basis of like-for-like\ncasement windows. The tenants queried why the works had not been included\nin the annual budget and why they could not be funded from reserves. It was\nagreed to omit the door entry replacement to save money.\n26. In April 2021, there was a second ballot as to whether the windows should be\nstandard top hung UPVC casement windows or UPVC sash windows. On 6 April\n(HB.1239), Ms Bedi wrote to Mr Shah with estimates of the relative cost of\ninstalling top hung casement windows (£124,137) and sash windows (£153,117).\nThe ballot closed on 14 April. Twelve tenants voted, six for each option.\n27. In June 2021, ig9 prepared a specification of works (at HB.786-791). This\nprovided for sash windows. On 23 June 2021, ig9 invited three contractors to\nquote for the replacement of the windows. Three tenders were returned\n(at.HB.755-7). Ig9 prepared a tender report and recommended that the\nPrincipal Contractor appoint Symphony, who had provided the lowest quote.\n28. In August 2021, ig9 prepared a further tender report for the other cyclical works\n(HB.758-774). Five tenders were invited and four were returned (at HB.775-\n778). Ig9 recommended that Probuild (London) Limited (PBL) who had\nprovided the lowest quote be appointed as the Principal Contractor.\n8\n\n29. On 27 August 2021 (at HB.597-601), Catalyst sent out the Notice of Estimates.\nCatalyst informed the tenants that they had decided to proceed with sash\nwindows. The outcome of the ballot had been a draw. Catalyst had therefore\ndecided to proceed under the existing planning application to install \"like-for-\nlike\" sash windows. Details of the estimates were provided. Catalyst proposed\nto appoint PBL as the Principal Contractor who had quoted £135,549 (exc VAT)\nand Symphony Windows, who had quoted £144,648 to replace the windows. To\nthis would be added VAT of 20% and professional fees of £15,000. For the six\ntenants at Pentagon House, the cost of the works would be £93,370, less a\nreserve fund contribution of £14,688. The estimated cost per tenant was\n£13,113.79.The Respondent offered a 12 month payment agreement.\n30. On 23 September 2021 (at HB.602), Mr Puvendran responded to the\nconsultation. He inquired why the costs had gone up by 50%.\n31. On 28 February 2022, Catalyst held a further meeting with tenants. The\nminutes are at HB.778-785. Fifteen tenants attended. John McDonnell MP also\nattended. The tenants queried the cost of the works. It was again suggested that\ncasement windows would have been cheaper. A tenant suggested that the\nreplacement of the windows was only required because of historic neglect.\nTenants asked how they could afford the works. Catalyst offered a repayment\nplan dependent upon the financial circumstances of the individual tenants. Mr\nHoareau states that he asked the meeting to confirm whether they preferred\ncasement windows to the sash windows that were proposed. 14 voted for\ncasement windows (58% of the total of 24 leaseholders). This vote did not\nappear in the minutes.\n32. On 1 April 2022, Catalyst became a subsidiary of Peabody. On 23 June (HB.952-\n955), Ms Bedi wrote to the tenants about the proposed works. She was the\nProject Manager. She has provided a detailed witness statement and gave\nevidence. The works started on 18 July and were completed on 21 October 2022.\nThe communal windows were installed in the week commencing 28 November\n2022. There is a substantial dispute between the parties as to the quality of the\nworks, which the Tribunal needs to determine.\n33. Ms Bedi sates that the programme of works consisted of the following: erect\nscaffolding; R & D survey; clean roofs; rainwater goods overhaul; Clean soffits\nand fascia; replace windows and doors; mastic, masonry works and cleaning;\nexternal decorations; and strike scaffolding.\n34. The final cost of the cyclical repairs was £364,777.43, namely (i) cost of works:\n£264,331.47; (ii) VAT: £52,866.29; + (iii) Professional fees (15%): £47,579.66.\n£131,000 was funded from the reserve fund. Thus the cost to be charged to\ntenants was £233,777.43. This should have been charged equally to the 24 flats,\nnamely £9,740.73 per tenant.\n35. On 29 January 2024, Peabody issued the initial demands for the works (at\nHB.634-672). The cost of the works were incorrectly apportioned based on an\nequal apportionment of the works carried out to the individual blocks. This was\n9\n\nincorrect. The leases define \"the buildings\" as the five blocks. The cost should\ntherefore have been apportioned equally between the 24 tenants. On 15 March\n2024 (at p.650-660), Peabody issued revised demands. This resulted in some\ntenants receiving a refund. However, the Respondent recognised that it was\nnow too late to issue a supplementary demand to those who had been charged\ntoo little.\nInitial Adjusted Benefit\nTenant Demand Demand\nNazim Shah (1 Pentagon House) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nLaurence Hoareau (2 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nPeter Latawiec (3 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nTiamour Osman (6 Pentagon) £9,554.16 - £186.57\nCarl Jackson (3 Meade House) £10,484.98 £9,740.73\nGavin Frederick (4 Kingfisher) £9,907.10 £9,740.73\nJeyasingham Puvendran £9,513.91 - £226.82\n(5 Welles House)\n36. On 28 April 2024, Mr Shah issued his application to this Tribunal. His main\ncomplaint was the sum that he had been charged for these cyclical works.\nHowever, he also challenges a number of service charges for 2023/24 and the\ninterim service charge for 20224/25. Over the subsequent weeks, tenants\nissued five further application.\nIssue 1: The Cyclical Works\n37. The Applicants raised a number of wide ranging arguments as to why they are\nnot obliged to contribute to the cost of the major works. We can deal with many\nof these briefly:\n(i) The Applicants suggest that the need for the works arises through \"historic\nneglect\". We are satisfied that for such a claim to succeed, the Applicants would\nneed to establish a counterclaim or set-off (see Continental Property Ventures\nInc v White [2007] L.& T.R.4). In particular, any tenant would need to establish\nthat he had a good claim for disrepair during the time that they were the lessee.\nNo tenant has established this. The ig9 Inspection Report, dated 11 January\n2019, does not suggest any widespread disrepair. It is consistent with what one\nwould expect from wooden windows which after 25 years were nearing the end\nof their natural lives.\n(ii) The Applicants rely on Clause 3 (19) of their leases to argue that they are\nonly liable for the cost of any repairs, insofar as the tenant caused or contributed\nto the disrepair by any act, neglect or default. This is to fail to understand the\nterms of the lease. If any individual tenant has caused any disrepair, he has a\npersonal responsibility to make good that damage. However, the landlord is\nrequired to repair, maintain and decorate the Buildings, and this is a service\ncharge expenditure for which all the tenants are liable.\n10\n\n(iii) The landlord failed to comply with the statutory consultation procedures.\nOn 5 April 2019, the Respondent served the Stage 1 \"Notice of Intention\". At\nthis stage, the tenants did not suggest casement windows. Neither did they\nsuggest a contractor from whom an estimate should be sought. On 27 August\n2021, the Respondent served the Stage 3 \"Notice of Estimates\". The Respondent\nhad tested the market and obtained four tenders for the work as \"Principal\nContractor\" and the for the replacement of the windows. The Respondent\nselected the lowest estimates.\n(iv) The Applicants complain of the overall cost of the works. There was an\nunfortunate delay in 2020 which was inevitable because of the Covid-19 lock\ndown. However, there was no need for the Respondent to serve a further \"Notice\nof Intention\". When the Covid-19 lockdown was lifted, there was a significant\nincrease in building costs. The Applicants were a victim of this.\n(v) The Applicants contend that the supervision fee of 15% was unreasonable.\nWe disagree. It is a standard charge for works of this type. However, we have\nfound that the supervision of this contract was inadequate (see below). We\ntherefore reduce The professional fees of £47,579.66 by £1,000 to reflect this.\n38. A particular concern raised by the Applicants, is the Respondent's decision to\ninstall sash, rather than casement, windows. All agreed that UPVC windows\nshould replace the existing wooden sash windows. It is common ground that\ncasement windows would have been cheaper (on 6 April 2021, Ms Bedi had\nsuggested that the cost would have been £124,137, as against £153,117). Mr\nJackson suggested that the cost would have been much cheaper and obtained a\nquote from Safe Style (at HB1,242) of £3,000 to install casement windows in\nhis flat. He also obtained a quote (at HB.1243) of £350 + VAT for use of a cherry\npicker for 7 days. The cost of scaffolding for some 15 weeks was £30,370.\n39. The Tribunal does not accept that it would have been appropriate to use a cherry\npicker for a job of this size. We do accept that the installation of the casement\nwould have been somewhat cheaper, say some £30k. However, we accept that\nthe Respondent was entitled to select sash, rather than casement, windows. Ms\nBedi stated that it was the Respondent's policy to replace windows on a like-for-\nlike basis for possible. The tenants had only raised the issue at a late stage in the\nconsultation process.\n40. Whilst a landlord must consult its tenants, it has the ultimate discretion as to\nwhat windows should be installed (see [19] above). The landlord was required\nto have due regard to views expressed by the tenants; it was not bound to accept\nthe majority view of the tenants. Catalyst's starting point was to go for sash\nwindows on a \"like-for-like\" basis. All agreed that UPVC was a more cost\neffective option that wood. It was only at a later stage that the tenants opted for\ncasement windows. In April 2021, the tenants had been split 50:50 on the two\noptions. The approach adopted by the Respondent cannot be categorised as\nunreasonable, albeit that the sash windows were somewhat more expensive. We\nare satisfied that the Respondent had regard to the financial impact of the works\non the tenants.\n11\n\n41. In their Scott Schedule, the Applicants challenge 31 items relating to the cyclical\nworks. Most relate to the quality of the works. The Applicants have provided a\nBundle of 950 pages. This includes a large number of photographs. The problem\nthat the Tribunal faces is that none of the photographs are dated. The\nApplicants have produced no evidence of who took the photos or the block to\nwhich they relate. They are no more than \"snapshots\". They show areas where\nworks have not been done. These are often small areas in the context of a job of\nthis size. They do not show areas where works have been done to a good\nstandard. Some disrepair may have arisen after the works were completed.\nSome photos relating to general maintenance problems, rather than to the\nprogramme of cyclical works. Many of the defects may now have been remedied.\n42. The photographs illustrate the following:\n(i) Disrepair to the brickwork (A.7-16; 895-896).\n(ii) Broken Vents (A.24-27).\n(iii) Defects to the casement windows (A.31-36).\n(iv) Defects to the communal doors (A.42-57, 815-818, 855-860, 867-872).\n(v) Disrepair to the communal lights (A.58-62).\n(vi) The photographs illustrate numerous defects to the new doors and windows\n(A.68-89, 799-803). The Tribunal notes the communal window at A.73 where a\nblock of wood has been inserted between the base of the window and the\nbrickwork.\n(vii) External fencing (A.396-415. 789-798, 805-815, 864-866, 873-878, 899-\n904).\n(viii) Defects to gutter soffits and rainwater good (A.426-434).\n(ix) Pointing Defects (A.569-572).\n(x) Defects to the roof and guttering (A.575-625). The photograph at A.592\nillustrated the debris which was left in the guttering. The photograph at A.596\nillustrates dirty soffits. The photograph at A.608 illustrates a loose verge cap\nwhich required attention.\n(xi) Defects to the stone cills (A.651-664).\n(xii) Disrepair to the knee high fencing (A.786-788, 803-804,861-863)\n(xiii) Defects to grills (A,907-908);\n12\n\n(xiv) Moss and lichen on the roofs: Pentagon House (A.911-915); Welles House\n(A.918-922); Kingfisher House (A.925-932) and Meade House (A.936-942).\nThese photographs provide compelling evidence that inadequate attention was\npaid to cleaning the roofs.\n43. The Tribunal is satisfied that the photographs depict poor finishes, bad\nworkmanship and areas where defects still remain. Some items are fairly\nstraight forward. For example, there is ample of evidence to suggest the roofs\nhave not been properly cleaned. The same applies to the gutters.\n44. Some of the paint from the external decorations is peeling. The Tribunal would\nnot expect it to be peeling so soon after the works have been completed. The\nApplicants have provided a report from Dulux confirming that the preparation\nis poor . They had sent samples to Dulux for testing (A.781-785).\n45. Mr Jackson complained that there had been a problem of condensation in his\nflat after the new windows had been installed. We note that he is living in his\none bedroom flat with his wife and two children. We suspect that the\ncondensation problem is due to the interaction between the moisture produced\nwithin the flat and the equation of ventilation, heating and insulation. The new\nwindows are likely to have reduced draughts from the old ill-fitting windows.\nWe are not satisfied that the condensation relates to the negligent installation\nof the windows.\n46. In her witness statement, Ms Bedi gives detailed evidence of the steps taken by\nthe Respondent to supervise the works. Snagging items were identified and\naddressed. Ms Bedi also gives evidence of the contact which she had with some\nof the Applicants:\n(i) Mr Hoareau (2 Pentagon House): On 14 December 2022 (at HB.1026), Mr\nHoareau raised a number of concerns relating to the windows and door in his\nflat. On 3 February 2023 (HB.1014), she sent an email to Mr Hoareau stating\nthat the defects had been remedied. Mr Hoareau did not respond to this.\n(ii) Mr Puvendran (5 Welles House): In December 2022, Mr Puvendran\ncomplained that draughts were coming through his windows in the bedroom\nand living room. Symphony agreed to fit a thicker gasket as a matter of good\nwill. The correspondence is at HB.1027-1037). Mr Puvendran was not satisfied\nwith the Respondent's response and invoked their complaint's procedure. On\n10 June 2024 (at HB.1161-4), the Respondent offered him £450 in\ncompensation. Mr Puvendran did not accept this offer.\n47. The Tribunal addresses the additional following items raised by the Applicants\nin their Scott Schedule:\n(i) Asbestos: The Applicant complain that no asbestos was removed. The\nRespondent agree. This item was removed from the final account. We accept\nthis.\n13\n\n(ii) Repointing masonry (£189.81). The Applicant complains that this was not\ncarried out to a reasonable standard. The Respondent disputes this. This is a\nmodest sum which we allow.\n(iii) Removal/Refix of TV aerials (£379.62). The Applicant complains that only\none aerial was removed. The Respondent agrees, but states that this was an\nitemised cost which did not depend on the number of units. The Tribunal agrees\nthat it was reasonable to include this in the contract specification.\n(iv) Clean soffits and fascias (£1,391.94). The Applicants state that no items\nwere cleaned. The Respondent states that this work was carried out and signed\noff. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an\nadequate standard. The Tribunal disallows £700.\n(v) Clean stone sills (£1,265.40). The Applicants state that no items were\ncleaned. The Respondent states that this work was carried out and signed off.\nThe Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an adequate\nstandard. The Tribunal disallows £600.\n(vi) Apply mastic to windows (£5,036.55): The Applicants assert that this was\npart of the basic installation and should not have been charged separately. The\nRespondent asserts that the specification made it clear that this work was to be\ndone by a specialist mastic contractor. The Tribunal is satisfied that the\nRespondent was entitled to take this course.\n(vii) Overheads/profit and Attendance (£23,400). The Applicants contend that\nthis is a vague charge which cannot be justified. The Respondent replies that\nthis is a standard charge in the trade. The Tribunal agree.\n(viii) Rain water goods (£2,480.18). The Applicants complain about the quality\nof the works. The Respondent replies that the work was water tested and signed\noff. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to an\nadequate standard. It does not accept that the debris shown in the photographs\narose subsequently. The Tribunal disallows £1,000.\n(ix) Clean Roof Tiles and replaced damaged tiles. The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. The Tribunal does not consider that this work\nwas carried out to an adequate standard and disallow £500.\n(x) External Decoration and Woodwork (£8,225.10). The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. They rely on their report from Dulux. The\nRespondent replies that the work was carried out to a satisfactory standard and\nwas signed off. The Tribunal does not consider that this work was carried out to\nan adequate standard and disallow £3,000.\n14\n\n(xi) Staining to woodwork (£5,061.60). The Applicants state that the woodwork\nwas not stained. The Respondent replies that the work was carried out to a\nsatisfactory standard and was signed off. We agree.\n(xii) Decoration to the communal doors (£1,898.10). The Applicants complain\nabout the quality of the works. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. Although the Applicants have provided a\nnumber of photographs, they have not satisfied us that any reduction should be\nmade.\n(xiii) Replacement of damaged vents (£197.99). The Applicants complain that\nthey have been charged for 15, but only 11 were replaced. The Respondent\nreplies that the work was satisfactory and was signed off. This is a modest sum\nwhich we allow.\n(xiv) Replace sections of knee high fence (£1,600). The Applicants complain\nthat only one small section was replaced. The Respondent replies that the work\nwas carried out to a section of fencing on a client instruction. Although the\nphotograph indicate some disrepair to the fencing, the Applicants have not\nsatisfied that these sections were included in the contract. We allow this charge.\n(xv) Ridge tile replacement and repointing (£1,125). The Applicants complain\nthat this work was not carried out. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory and was signed off. The photographs indicate a number of defects\nand we disallow £500.\n(xvi) Brickwork repairs (£800). The Applicants assert that this was not part of\nthe cyclical works. The Respondent replies that it was. The work was checked\nand signed off. We allow this item.\n(xvii) Fencing repairs prior to redecoration (£450). The Applicants complain\nthat no fences were repaired. In any event, the fencing is not part of the estate.\nThe Respondent replies that minor works were executed to parts of fencing\nwhich fall within the estate. We allow this modest charge.\n(xviii) Pest proof vents (£360). The Applicants initially asserted that no vents\nwere pest proofed. The Applicants now accept that work was carried out to one\nvent but not to an adequate standard. The Respondent replies that the work was\nsatisfactory. The Applicants have not satisfied us that we should disallow this\nitem.\n(xix) Rake out and repoint gaps to sub cills (£75). The Applicants assert that no\nwork was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and\nsigned off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xx) Rake out and repoint window heads (£75). The Applicants assert that no\nwork was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and\nsigned off. We allow this modest sum.\n15\n\n(xxi) Rake out and repoint side of concrete cills (£50). The Applicants assert\nthat no work was done. The Respondent replies that the work was completed\nand signed off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xxii) Repointing of brickwork above rear door of 1 Welles House (£95). The\nApplicants initially asserted that only one was replaced. They now accept the\nneed to pay a reasonable amount. The Respondent replies that the work was\ncompleted and signed off. 16 verge caps were completed. We allow this modest\nsum.\n(xxiii) Supply and fit new dry verge caps where missing (£95). The Applicants\nassert that no work was done. The Respondent replies that the work was\ncompleted and signed off. We allow this modest sum.\n(xxiv) Rebuild bin stores (£595). The Applicants complain that this was not part\nof the cyclical works and the works were not completed to a satisfactory\nstandard. The Respondent replies that the work was completed and signed off.\nWe allow this item.\n(xxv) Remove ivy (£50). The Applicants complain that they have been double\ncharged as this was part of the gardening contract. The Respondent replies that\nthe work was completed as part of the cyclical works programme and signed off.\nWe allow this modest item.\n(xxvi) Repoint 5 window fills (£100). The Applicants complain that this is part\nof the window replacement and they are being charged twice. The Respondent\nreplies that the work was carried out to the first floor cills in three blocks. The\nworks were completed and signed off. We allow this modest item.\n(xxvii) CT1 window fills (£75). The Applicants complain that this was part of the\nwindow installation and they are being charged twice. The Respondent denies\nthat there has been any duplication. The work was carried out to the window\ncills on the first floors at Kingfisher House, Sovereign Hose and Meade Houe.\nWe allow this modest charge,\n(xxviii) Relay dropped tiles gable end Meade House (£1,700): The Applicants\ncomplain that this work was not done. The Respondent replies that the work\nwas completed and signed off. We allow this modest item.\n(xxix) Window and door replacement (£144,648 + VAT). The only issue raised\nby the Applicants is that of historic neglect. We have already rejected this\nchallenge (see [37(i)] above).\n48. The Tribunal have made modest deductions of £7,300 out of a contract in the\nsum of £364,777. Each Applicant is therefore entitled to a deduction of £304.17.\nHowever, whilst Mr Jackson and Mr Frederick paid their full 4.167%\ncontribution towards the works, Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau, Mr Latawiec and Mr\nOsman paid £186.57 less than his full share, whilst Mr Puvendran paid £226.82\n16\n\nless (see Table at [35] above). We consider that these sums should be credited\nagainst the reductions that we have made. Thus we make deductions of (i)\n£117.60 for Mr Shah, Mr Hoareau, Mr Latawiec and Mr Osman; (ii) £304.17 for\nMr Jackson and Mr Frederick and (iii) £77.35 for Mr Puvendran.\nIssue 2: The Service Charges for 2023/24\n49. The Service Charge Account for April 2023 to March 2024 is at HB.371. This is\nbroken down to the 4.167% which each tenant is required to pay. The total\nservice charge for the year was £1,685.53, whilst the budget was £1,586,88. The\ntenants were therefore required to pay an additional £98.65.\n50. The Applicants challenge six items. The Respondent has conceded three of\nthese:\n(i) Communal Electricity: The Respondent has agreed to reduce the sum\ncharged of £176.72 by £88.36.\n(ii) Smoke Vents & Fire Systems: The Respondent has recognised that there was\na mistake and have reduced the sum of £87.06 to £64.24, a credit of £22.82.\n(iii) Gardening Scheme: The Respondent has agreed to a 50% reduction from\n£167.75 to £83.33. The Applicants have provided a number of photographs of\nthe state of the garden (at A.892-894). Ms Kamba stated that the Respondent\nhad made the reduction as a gesture of good will.\n51. Three items remain in dispute:\n(i) Communal Maintenance/Repairs: £42.11. The Applicants had initially\nasserted that no communal repairs had been executed. Ms Kamba has produced\nthe invoices. The Applicants then complained about the quality of the works. At\nthe hearing, the Applicants confirmed that this item was no longer in dispute.\n(ii) Entry Phone: £48.35. The Applicants contend that there was no evidence of\nany work being done. Ms Kamba has provided details of the four invoices which\ntotal £1,160.44 at HB.436. We therefore allow this.\n(iii) Property Insurance: £259.33. The Applicants' complaint is that the budget\nhad included a sum of £41.16 had appeared in the budget, whilst the actual sum\nwas £259.33. The charge in the previous year had been £31.68. Ms Kamba gave\na full explanation for the increase in the insurance. The charge of £31.68 had\nbeen a legacy charge from their block policy. This reflected two factors: (i)\nCatalyst had undervalued its properties by some 50%; (ii) the cover had been\narranged through Legacy who had offered rates substantially below the market.\nLegacy have now withdrawn from the social housing market. Ms Kamba\ndescribes how Peabody had consulted on a proposal for a Qualifying Lont-Term\nAgreement for insurance. She provides reasons as to why insurance has\n17\n\nincreased. Peabody had explained why insurance had gone up on their website\n(at HB.475-8). The Applicants have not provided any evidence that insurance\ncould have been secured at a lower premium. We are an expert tribunal. We are\nsatisfied that an insurance charge of £259.33 is reasonable for these one\nbedroom flats.\n52. It is agreed that the Applicants are entitled to refunds of £194.51.\nIssue 3: The Interim Service Charges for 2024/25\n53. The budget for the year is at HB.550. The Tribunal explained that any landlord\nhas to make a judgment as to what sums should be included in a budget. When\nthe service charge accounts for the year are available, there will be a\nreconciliation between the budgeted and the actual expenditure. Further, any\nchallenge to the quality of the service can only be made at the end of the service\ncharge year.\n54. The Applicants challenge seven items in their Scott Schedule. They indicated\nthat they no longer challenge the figure for pest control (£4.32). The\nRespondent agreed to reduce the sum for communal electricity insurance by\n50% (£105.67).\n55. The remaining sums remain in dispute:\n(i) Gardening: £175.44: The Applicants complain about the quality of the\nservice. Work is sporadic and is not carried out to an acceptable or reasonable\nstandard. The Applicants confirmed that they did not dispute the sum included\nin the budget. When a budget is prepared, it must be assumed that works will\nbe carried out to an acceptable standard. We therefore allow this sum.\n(ii) Smoke Vents/Fire Systems: £183.48: The Applicants state in the Scott\nSchedule that there is no system in place. The Respondent replies that this\nheading covers the emergency lighting system from which each block benefits.\nThis is a 5% uplift on the 2023/24 estimate. We are satisfied that this budget\nsum is reasonable.\n(iii) Tree Surgery: £31.68: The Applicants contend that there are no trees on the\nestate that require surgery. In the Scott Schedule, the Respondent argued that\nthis was only an estimate and there would be a credit if there was no such work.\nAt the hearing, the Respondent took the contrary position. They agreed that this\nsum should be disallowed. If there is any such expenditure, it will be included\nin the final service charge accounts.\n(iv) Audit and Accountancy: £14.40: The Applicants argued that there was no\nrequirement in the lease for the accounts to be audited. The Respondent\nreferred to Clause 7 (5)(c) of the leases. In the light of this, the Applicants did\nnot pursue their challenge.\n18\n\n(v) Property Insurance: £427.68: The Applicants complain that this sum is\nexcessive. The Tribunal has found that the actual expenditure of £259.33 was\nreasonable. Whilst £424.68 had been included in the budget, Ms Kamba stated\nthat after the Section 20 Consultation, the tenants had been informed that the\ninsurance would be in the region of £400. The Tribunal accepts that insurance\npremiums are increasing. However, we are satisfied that the estimate of\n£424.68 was unreasonable. We allow £400.\n56. The Tribunal has made deductions of £162.03 to the budget.\nApplication under s.20C and refund of fees\n57. At the end of the hearing, the Applicants made an application for a refund of\nthe fees that they have paid in respect of these six applications. We understand\nthat they have paid £800, namely 6 application fees of £100 and a hearing fee\nof £200. The Applicants have only succeeded on a small number of points. We\ntherefore make an order that they should be able to recover 25%, namely £200.\n58. In the application form, the Applicants applied for an order under section 20C\nof the 1985 Act in respect of the cost of these proceedings. It is not for this\ntribunal to make a determination as to whether the landlord is entitled under\nthe leases to pass on these costs through the service charge. Section 20C (3)\npermits the Tribunal to make such order as it considers just and equitable in\nthe circumstances. Given our findings, we are satisfied that the Respondent\nshould be restricted to passing on 75% of their costs.\n59. The Respondent has not indicated whether it intends to pass on its costs\nthrough the service charge or as to the level of costs that it would intend to\ncharge to the tenants. The Tribunal records its concern that any such costs\nshould be proportionate. The Respondent has been represented by Counsel\nwith two representatives from her instructing solicitor in attendance. These\ntribunals are intended to be informal and have adopted procedures so that\nparties do not need to be represented. We note that it is always open to the\ntenants to challenge the size of any such costs through a separate application if\nthey consider these to be unreasonable. However, the Respondent is to be\ncommended for the constructive manner in which it has sought to respond to\nthese applications.\n60. The Tribunal also makes an order pursuant to paragraph 5A of Schedule 11 to\nthe Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 restricting the ability of the\nRespondent from charging an administration charge in respect of its litigation\ncosts. However, the Tribunal does not consider that this is strictly necessary, as\nit would not seem to be open to the Respondent to levy such a charge.\nJudge Robert Latham\n29 July 2025\n19\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of appeal they\nmay have.\nIf a Party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), then\na written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nregional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within 28\ndays after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person making the\napplication.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the\n28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide whether to\nallow the application for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the\ntime limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the tribunal to\nwhich it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number), state the grounds\nof appeal and state the result the party making the application is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n20"

The form of remote hearing was V: CPVEREMOTE. A face-to-face\nhearing was not held because it was not practicable and all issues could be\ndetermined in a remote hearing. The parties have provided a Bundle of\nDocuments for the hearing. The order made is described at the end of these\nreasons.\nBackground\n1. This is an application made pursuant to Section 48 of the Leasehold\nReform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (the “1993 Act”) for\na determination of the premium to be paid and the terms for a new lease.\n2. The hearing of this application took place on 16 June 2021. The\nApplicants, tenants, were represented by Mr Edward Ross (counsel) and\n\nevidence was given by Mr Wilson Dunsin FRICS. The Respondent was\nrepresented by Mr Andrew Orme who had also provided a valuation\nreport.\n3. The application relates to Flat 4, 257-259 Brownhill Road, London SE6\n1AE (the “Property”). The Property is a purpose built flat on the first\nfloor of a three-storey block of six units. The block is located in Catford\non the South Circular (A205).\n4. The Property has been altered internally from a former one bedroom flat\ninto its current configuration as a two-bedroom flat but with an open\nplan lounge/kitchen.\n5. On 13 March 2020, a Section 42 Notice of Claim was served proposing a\npremium for a lease extension of £6,645. The benefit of the section 42\nnotice was assigned to the Applicants the same day. On 20 May 2020,\nthe Respondent served a Counter-Notice proposing a premium of\n£16,000.\n6. As set out in a statement of agreed facts, the following matters have been\nagreed between the parties:\n(1) Property: First floor purpose built flat in three-storey block of six\nunits.\n(2) Lease date: 27th April 1978.\n(3) Lease Term: 120 years from 29th September 1977 to 28th\nSeptember 2097.\n(4) Date of Valuation: 13th March 2020.\n(5) Unexpired Term: 77.54 years.\n(6) The respondent is the competent landlord.\n(7) Ground Rent: £40 per annum.\n(8) Marriage Value: 50%.\n(9) Extended Lease Value is 99% of the Freehold Vacant Possession\nValue.\n(10) Deferment Rate: 5%.\n(11) Capitalisation Rate: 7%.\n2\n\nAt the hearing, it was also confirmed that relativity had been agreed at\n88.79%.\n7. The sole issue in dispute was the notional freehold value / extended lease\nvalue and existing lease value: the Applicants contend for £155,655 in\nrespect of the notional freehold value, whereas the Respondent contends\nfor £250,000.\n8. As a result, in their respective reports, Mr Dunsin had computed a\npremium of £9,979; Mr Orme one of £17,696.\nNotional freehold value\n9. The Property was sold in March 2020, with the benefit of the section 42\nNotice, for £202,500. Both parties placed considerable weight on this\nand effectively used it as a starting point in their valuations. Indeed, as\nMr Ross pointed out, in paragraph 168 of the Upper Tribunal’s decision\nin Mundy v Trustees of the Sloane Stanley Estate [2016] UKUT 223\n(LC), it was stated as follows:\n“… in some (perhaps many) cases in the future, it is likely that there will have\nbeen a market transaction at around the valuation date in respect of the\nexisting lease with rights under the 1993 Act. If the price paid for that market\ntransaction was a true reflection of market value for that interest, then that\nmarket value will be a very useful starting point for determining the value of\nthe existing lease without rights under the 1993 Act…”.\nThe Applicants’ valuation\n10. Mr Dunsin carried out an inspection of the Property on 21 June 2019.\nAccording to his evidence, his understanding was that\nit remained vacant until the sale in March 2020. In contrast to Mr Orme,\nhis opinion was that no adjustment should be made for alleged disrepair\nof the Property. He provided photographs and estate agent particulars to\nsupport the assertion that it was in a good condition.\n11. He considered that improvements should be disregarded which should\nresult in a deduction from the starting point of the sale price. These\nincluded the modernisation of the kitchen and bathroom, installation of\ncentral heating and double glazing and, most significantly, the\nconversion of the Property into a 2-bed flat. There was a reference in his\nreport to the fact that such works might have cost in the region of\n£60,000, although in the tribunal’s view, that would not necessarily\nequate to an increase in value.\n3\n\n12. Ultimately, Mr Dunsin applied a deduction of 30% in respect of\nimprovements to the Property. This gave an adjusted short lease value of\n£141,750, adjusted to an existing lease value of £138,206 on the basis of\na no-Act world. Mr Dunsin then, in effect, applied relativity in reverse to\nobtain the notional freehold value and extended lease value – the former\nbeing £155,655.\n13. Although Mr Dunsin referred to two other properties, he accepted that\nthey were not true comparables, but rather were used as a check against\nhis calculations to confirm, in his view, that he was broadly correct. Mr\nDunsin’s evidence was that it was very difficult to find comparables in\nthe present case.\n14. The first was 14 Keswick Court, a 45m2 one-bedroom purpose built flat\non the second floor of a modern (1995 built) four storey block in a private\ndevelopment. It was sold for £168,500 on 20 January 2020 with a short\n74.6 year lease. According to Mr Dunsin, 14 Keswick Court was in an\naverage condition but in a better location compared to the Property and\nhad an allocated car parking space. In Mr Dunsin’s view, his adjusted\nshort lease value of £141,750 for the Property is supported by the\n£168,500 for 14 Keswick Court once suitable adjustments have been\nmade for the differences between the two properties.\n15. The second property referred to was 3a Bargery Road, London, SE6 2LL,\na 46m2 one-bedroom purpose built flat with a private garden situated on\nthe first floor of a three-storey ex local authority block. According to Mr\nDunsin, 3a Bargery Road was in a good condition with uPVC double\nglazed windows and full gas central heating and had been improved and\nmodernised – and was in a more desirable location than the Property. 3a\nBargery Road was sold for £194,250 on 11th December 2020 with an\n87.5-year lease. In Mr Dunsin’s view, this property was able to support\nthe extended lease value for the Property of £154,098 after suitable\nadjustments have been made for the differences between the two flats.\nThe Respondent’s valuation\n16. Mr Orme relied on two comparables; the Property itself and flat 6 in the\nsame building.\n17. Dealing first with flat 4, while Mr Orme agreed with Mr Dunsin that\ntenant’s improvements should be disregarded such that the Property\n4\n\nshould be valued as a 1-bedroom flat, he declined to apply a reduction to\nthe 2020 sale price on this basis. Instead, he placed greater weight on the\nrelatively large floor area of the Property and also the potential for\nconversion to a 2-bed flat. Further, his view was that an additional sum\nshould be applied to take into account alleged disrepair. Photographs\nwere included within the bundle which were said to show the alleged\ndisrepair. This, together with adjustments for a ‘no Act world’ gave an\nadjusted price of £235,000.\n18. Flat 6 was sold in March 2016 for £197,000 with 81.5 years still to run on\nthe lease. Mr Orme applied adjustments to take into account (i) property\ninflation since the date of sale; (ii) the different floor area compared to\nthe Property; and (iii) for a ‘no Act world’, to arrive at an adjusted price\nof £265,895.\n19. Mr Orme’s proposed notional freehold value for the Property of\n£250,000 was said to be based on aggregating the adjusted figures for\neach flat.\n20. Mr Orme also made reference to the statutory premium paid to extend\nthe lease in relation to another flat in the same building. However, no\ndetails are provided as to the condition of that flat and there is no\ninformation about what calculations were used or how the figure was\narrived at. Accordingly, the tribunal concludes that this is of little\nevidential value. Finally, Mr Orme notes briefly that the Respondent\nobtained an opinion of value for marketing purposes for the Property\nfrom a local estate agent in May 2021, suggesting a marketing price of\n£280,000. However, in his report, Mr Orme concedes that “this is not\nevidence like the three” other transactions referred to and in the\ntribunal’s view this does not assist in carrying out the valuation –\nparticularly in light of the fact that we already have the actual sale price\nfor the Property from March 2020.\nDiscussion and decision\n21. Dealing first with Mr Orme’s calculation, with regard to flat 4, the\ntribunal does not accept that it would be appropriate to add an\nadditional sum to the starting point of the sale price to take account of\nalleged disrepair. In cross examination, Mr Orme accepted that he had\nnever visited the Property and had not taken the photographs included\n5\n\nin the report. Further, he could not say when the photographs had been\ntaken. This is to be contrasted with Mr Dunsin’s express statement in his\nreport that the “property was not suffering from any disrepair at the time\nof my inspection”. In the circumstances, and having regard to the\nphotographs and estate agent particulars contained in Mr Dunsin’s\nreport which do not show disrepair within the flat, the tribunal concludes\nthat there is not sufficient evidence to make a finding that there was\ndisrepair at the relevant date or that it should affect valuation.\n22. With regard to flat 6 as a comparable, the tribunal considers that this can\nprovide only limited assistance. We note the point raised on behalf of the\nApplicants that there is no evidence as to the condition of flat 6 at the\ndate of sale. We are also conscious that the sale is somewhat historic,\nhaving taken place approximately 4 years prior to the valuation date in\nthe present case.\n23. Turning to Mr Dunsin’s approach to the valuation exercise, we are\nsatisfied that it would be appropriate to make a deduction from the\nMarch 2020 sale price to take account of improvements to the flat and,\nin particular, the fact that the Property had been converted from a 1-bed\nto a 2-bed flat. We note that there was no dispute between the parties\nthat tenant improvements should be disregarded. The tribunal also\naccepts Mr Dunsin’s evidence that the Property is in a less desirable\nlocation compared to the comparables. According to his report, Mr\nDunsin has “considerable experience of surveying and valuing properties\nin the Catford area of South East London where the subject property is\nlocated”. In contrast, Mr Orme accepted that he was not familiar with the\nparticular area.\n24. However, the tribunal does not go as far as Mr Dunsin in applying a 30%\ndeduction in respect of improvements. In this regard, the tribunal also\nagrees with Mr Orme that greater weight should be applied to the size of\nthe Property and the potential for conversion to a 2-bedroom flat (which\nhas in fact taken place).\n25. In tribunal’s view, a more appropriate figure for the existing lease value\nwould be £159,500 (as opposed to the figure of £138,206 proposed by\nMr Dunsin as set out above). This gives a deduction for improvements\nbut also allows for the size of the Property. In our determination, such a\n6\n\nfigure is also broadly consistent with the sale price in 14 Keswick Court.\nWhen compared to the Property in the present case, we would make\ndeductions of £45,000 to the sale price of £168,500 for that property to\nreflect the better area, the improvements (including central heating,\ndouble glazing, new bathroom and kitchen) and the car parking space.\nHowever, the Property (in the present case) has a larger floor area and\nthus the potential to create a second bedroom. The tribunal has made an\naddition of £40,000 to the adjusted sale price of 14 Keswick Court to\nreflect this. This would give an adjusted price of £163,500 which would\nbe reduced to £159,412 with a 2.5% reduction for no-Act rights. This is\nconsistent with our existing lease value of £159,500 for the Property.\n26. With regard to the other comparable referred to Mr Dunsin,\nnotwithstanding the qualification that it was merely being used as a\ncheck, the tribunal takes the view that only very limited assistance can be\nprovided by 3a Bargery Road to support the extended lease value,\nparticularly in light of the fact that it involved a sale with only 87.5 years\nstill to run. Instead, and in the absence of a suitable comparable, the\ntribunal determines that in order to calculate the extended lease value, it\nis necessary to take the existing lease value and apply the agreed\nrelativity rate of 88.79% to determine the notional freehold value and\nextended lease value.\nConclusions\n27. For the reasons set out above, we make the following determinations on\nthe issues in dispute:\n(1) Existing lease value - £159,500\n(2) Long Leasehold Value – £177,841\n(3) Notional Freehold Value - £179,637\n28. We determine the premium payable to be £11,500. Our working\ncalculation is set out in the Appendix.\nName: Judge Sheftel Date: 12 July 2021\n7\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n8\n\nAppendix\nValuation of Flat 4, 257-259\nBrownhill Road, London SE6\n1AE\nRelevant Date 13 March 2020\nUnexpired Term 77.54 years\nNotional Freehold £179,637\nExtended Lease £177,841\nRelativity 88.79%\nExisting Lease £159,500\nTerm\nInitial ground rent £40\nYP 77.54 years @7% 14.2105 £568.42\nReversion\nFreehold VP £179,637\nPV £1 in 77.54 years 5% 0.02275 £4086.742 £4655.1618\nLess Freeholder reversion on\nextension\nAfter extension £179,637\nPV of £1 167.54 years at 5% 0.00028 £50.29836 £4604.8634 £4,604.86\nDiminution\nMarriage Value\nValue after lease extension £177,841\nFreeholder's extended lease value £50\nTotal £177,891\nless\nexisting freeholder's interest £4,655\nexisting leaseholder interest £159,500 £164,155\n£13,736\nlandlord share 50% £6,868.15 £6,868\nLease Extension Premium £11,473.01\nsay £11,500\n9"

The Applicants are the assured tenants of 8 Blythewood Close, Solihull,\nWest Midlands, B91 3HL (the Property). Their Landlord is the\nRespondent in this matter, Highways England Company Limited. The\nProperty is managed on behalf of the Respondent by Carter Jonas\n2. By way of Notice dated 21 August 2018, served under S13(2) of the\nHousing Act 1988 (the 1988 Act), the Respondent proposed an increase\nof rent from £1200.00 a month to a new rent of £1500.00 a month (the\nS13 Notice). The commencement date for the new rent was given in the\nS13 Notice as 1 October 2018.\n3. The Applicants moved into the Property in 2006. Their current tenancy\nagreement commenced in 2016.\n4. The Applicants made their application for referral of the S13 Notice to\nthe Tribunal in time.\n5. The tenancy is an assured periodic tenancy. The tenancy (not being for a\nfixed period of 7 years or more) is subject to Section 11 of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act 1985 (under which the Landlord is responsible for all\nrepairs to the property except internal decoration).\nInspection, submissions and hearing\n6. The Tribunal inspected the Property on 13 November 2018 in the\npresence of the Applicants. The Respondent did not attend, having been\nproperly notified of the date and time of the inspection.\n7. The property is a large detached house located approximately 1 km north\nof Knowle and 2 km south east of Solihull town centre in a desirable\nresidential area that includes Lady Byron Lane and Warwick Road.\n8. The property was built in the 1960’s and includes gas central heating and\ndouble glazing throughout. The accommodation on the ground floor\ncomprises entrance hall, showeroom/toilet, living room, dining room,\nkitchen with utility room off, and access from the utility room to a toilet\nand garage. The second floor comprises four double bedrooms, one en-\nsuite and a bathroom. There are gardens to the front and rear.\n9. The Property was in good decorative condition.\n10. A significant feature of the Property, and a material factor in respect of\nrent, is its close proximity to Junction 5 of the M42 motorway. The\nApplicants asserted the Property was only 42 metres from the south-\nbound carriageway of the motorway. This distance was not disputed by\nthe Respondent and upon inspection it was clear to the Tribunal that the\nProperty was indeed very close to the motorway. Standing in the rear\ngarden and inside the house and in particular from the bedrooms with\n2\n\nthe windows open, it was evident that the noise from the motorway was\nsufficiently loud and intrusive to affect the Applicants peaceful\nenjoyment of the of the property. The level of noise produced by heavy\ntraffic can contribute to stress-related health problems. Furthermore,\ntraffic noise has a variety of adverse impacts on human health which\nincludes disturbing sleep patterns and the wider health risks from\nexcessive pollution. The most widespread impact is however more often\nsimply annoyance.\n11. The evidence comprised written and oral submissions from both parties,\nand that derived from the inspection. The Tribunal took all of the\nevidence into account. Reference is made below to specific evidence\nwhere necessary.\n12. The Applicants’ submissions contended that the rental value of the\nsubject property is materially affected by two main issues; the close\nproximity of the motorway to the Property and the fact that the Property\nis at risk of being the subject of a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO).\n13. The Applicants made detailed submissions in response to the\nRespondent’s comparables, the most significant of which was the fact\nthat all bar two of the comparables were not close to the motorway. The\ntwo properties that were close to the motorway, 2 and 3 Poolmeadow\nClose, were 150 metres from the motorway compared to the 42 metres\ndistance for the Property.\n14. The Property had been recently decorated throughout by the Applicants\nat their own expense. The Applicants submitted that the Property had\nnot been redecorated since they moved in in 2006. Their requests of the\nRespondent that the Respondent redecorate the interior was refused.\nThe Applicants conceded that the tenancy agreement did not confer\nresponsibility for internal redecoration upon the Respondent.\n15. The Applicants suggested that a reasonable rent for the Property was\n£1300.00 pcm.\n16. Of the 14 properties submitted by the Respondent as comparables, the\nRespondent stated that the best comparables were 2 and 3 Poolmeadow\nClose. These properties were also close to the motorway, and were also at\nrisk of being compulsorily purchased under a CPO. The properties were\nboth let fairly recently at £1500.00 and Mrs Smith of Carter Jonas told\nthe Tribunal that she believed that a market rent for the Property would\nbe between £1700 and £1800 a month, and that a discount down to\n£1500 was appropriate due to the proximity of the motorway. She\nconceded that the risk of the CPO may also affect the rent, but did not\nprovide a figure as to the applicable discount in respect of the risk. She\nsubmitted that a reasonable rent for the Property was £1500.00 pcm.\nThe Tribunal’s deliberations\n17. In accordance with the terms of section 14 of the Housing Act 1988, the\nTribunal determined the rent at which it considered that the subject\n3\n\nproperty might reasonably be expected to be let on the open market by a\nwilling landlord under an assured tenancy.\n18. In so doing, the Tribunal, as required by section 14(2), ignored the effect\non the rental value of any relevant tenant’s improvements as defined in\nsection 14(2) of the Act.\n19. The Tribunal cannot take account of any history of alleged disrepair to\nthe property, or of any dispute between the parties as to the condition of\nthe property, in coming to its decision. However, the Tribunal can, and\nindeed, must take the condition of the property into account when\ncoming to its decision, to the extent that the condition of the property\naffects the market rent.\n20. In the first instance the Tribunal determined what rent the Landlord\ncould reasonably be expected to obtain in the open market on the\nassumption that the property is let in a condition that would be\nconsidered usual for a property of this type and location. It did this by\nhaving regard to the Tribunal’s own general knowledge of market rent\nlevels and the evidence of comparable rents provided by the parties.\n21. Having done this, the Tribunal concluded that the market rent for a\nsimilar property, unaffected by both main issues, would be £1750.00 per\ncalendar month (pcm). This is consistent with the Respondent’s figure of\n£1700.00 to £1800.00 pcm, and with the comparables provided.\n22. It was clear to the Tribunal that the constant noise from the motorway is\nsignificant and would be a major consideration for a tenant alongside the\nair pollution from the traffic as well as the fact that the property may also\nbe compulsorily acquired at some point in the near future.\n23. Based on the properties at 2 and 3 Poolmeadow Close the Respondent\narrived at a rent of £1,500 for the subject property. The Tribunal does\nnot however consider this evidence sufficiently relevant as they are\nfurther from the motorway than the Property. In addition, they are\nbungalows which tend to command a premium whereas the Property is a\nhouse.\n24. The Tribunal considered that any rental adjustment would have to be\nsufficiently significant to reflect the impact of the proximity of the\nmotorway and the possible effect of the CPO risk particularly given the\ntype of property, its location and the likely market for the property as a\nfamily home.\n25. The Tribunal considered this adjustment to be at least £400.00 a month\nand therefore concludes that the appropriate market rent for the\nProperty is £1350.00.\n26. The Tribunal has also had regard to the general specification of the\nProperty and considers it to be below the standard generally expected for\nthis type of property in this location. It is therefore necessary to adjust\n4\n\nthat hypothetical rent of £1350.00 pcm to allow for these differences.\n(See paragraph 28 below for details).\n27. The Tribunal has considered the condition and state of repair found at\nthe property. The Applicant advised that it had undertaken some\nredecoration works throughout the Property at its own cost. The\nTribunal found these works were carried out to a satisfactory standard\nand the Property was generally in a fair state of repair and condition.\n28. The Tribunal has made adjustments to reflect the fact the Property is let\nwithout certain items that would ordinarily be expected to be included in\na property of this type. In particular, the Tribunal has deducted £40.00\npcm to reflect the lack of landlord’s white goods and unmodernised\nbathrooms, £5.00 pcm for the Applicants’ works carried out in respect of\nthe dishwasher, and £5.00 pcm in respect of provision by the Applicants\nof flooring to the kitchen and general light fittings.\n29. The deductions total £50.00 pcm. The Tribunal therefore concluded that\nthe rent at which the property might reasonably be expected to be let on\nthe open market would be £1300.00 pcm.\n30. The rent will take effect from 1 October 2018, being the date set out in\nthe S13 Notice.\nThe Decision\n31. The rent determined by the Tribunal is £1300.00 pcm. The rent will\ntake effect from 1 October 2018.\nIf either party is dissatisfied with this decision they may apply for permission\nto appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) on a point of law. Prior to\nmaking such an appeal an application must be made, in writing, to this\nTribunal for permission to appeal. Any such application must be made within\n28 days of the issue of this statement of reasons, stating the grounds upon\nwhich it is intended to rely on in the appeal.\nName: Judge S McClure Date: 13 December 2018\n5"

The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR24"

For The Old Forge....................................... £6 300\nb. For White Gables ....................................... £5 050\nBackground\n2. Yet again the tribunal is asked to deal with two of the many leases for a term of\n500 years that were granted in the late Elizabethan period and at the start of the\nreign of King James VI & I. The tribunal’s own researches, which include some\nobservations by the editor of the current (6th) edition of Megarry & Wade, tend\nto support the view that the explanation why so many 500 year leases were\ngranted in this period concerned not so much strict settlements (which developed\nlater) but wardship – an unfortunate element of the feudal tenure by knight\nservice which was used by the Crown to raise extra cash without having to call a\nParliament to argue about his budget.1 The tribunal assumed it was a means by\nwhich the Crown or the ward's \"guardian\" could help himself and despoil the\nvalue of the estate, but Dr Charles Harpum has explained it as a preventive\nmeasure often employed by estates to reduce their land value and thus discourage\nthe king from exercising his rights of wardship where the heir was still a minor\n(which rights could include telling him whom he should marry. Refusal was\npossible, but bold and expensive). The whole thing was ended by Parliament\nduring the Civil War and confirmed, upon its insistence, on the restoration of\nCharles II in 1660.\n3. In the instant cases the properties stand on land let under one or more of three\nleases granted by John Lennard and Sampson Lennard to Richard Webb, for a\n500 year term. No further particulars are known or were supplied on first\nregistration (as long ago as February 1913) other than that the annual rent is one\npeppercorn.\n4. On 31st May 2018 in the County Court at Peterborough, the applicant issued a\nclaim under Part 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 seeking a transfer to her of\nthe freehold of The Old Forge. By an order made by Deputy District Judge Evans\nat a hearing in Cambridge on 19th July 2018 the freehold title in the property was\nvested in the applicant subject to the appropriate sum being paid into court, the\namount to be determined by this tribunal.\n5. So far as White Gables is concerned, on 19th September 2018, in the County Court\nat Peterborough, the applicant issued a similar Part 8 claim. By an order made\n1 See Charles J Reid Jnr : The Seventeenth Century Revolution in the English Land Law (Cleveland\nState University, 1995), at pgs 234–241\n\nby District Judge Bosman at a hearing in Cambridge on 29th October 2018 the\nfreehold title in the property was vested in the applicant subject to the\nappropriate sum being paid into court, the amount to be determined by this\ntribunal.\nApplicable valuation principles\n6. The annual rent under the leases (one peppercorn) has been treated as nominal,\nand the purchase price is determined in accordance with section 9(1) of the\nLeasehold Reform Act 1967, the relevant elements of which may be listed as :\na. The capitalised value of the rent payable from date of service of the notice\nof the tenant’s claim (in the case of a missing landlord, the date that\nproceedings are issued) until the original term date\nb. The capitalised value of the section 15 modern ground rent notionally\npayable from the original term date for a further period of 50 years\nc. The value of the landlord’s reversion to the house and premises after the\nexpiry of the 50-year lease extension.\n7. Although valuers have long operated on the assumption that this third element\nwould be deferred so long as to be almost valueless, and hence they tended to\nignore it and instead carry out only a two-stage valuation, the Upper Tribunal\n(Lands Chamber) determined in the case of Re Clarise Properties Ltd2 that there\nwas now a much greater likelihood that the ultimate reversion would have a\nsignificant value than there was when the two-stage approach was adopted 40\nyears ago, because :\na. House prices had increased substantially in real terms; and\nb. Lower deferment rates had been applied since the decision in Earl\nCadogan v Sportelli.3\nThe practice of conducting a two-stage valuation should therefore cease and the\nfull three-stage calculation, including the Haresign4 addition, be applied.\n8. Section 9(1) requires that the price payable shall be the amount which at the\nrelevant time the house and premises, if sold in the open market by a willing\nseller (with the tenant and members of his family not buying or seeking to buy),\nmight be expected to realise on the assumptions listed in the sub-section.\n9. Interestingly, however, in Re Clarise Properties the President drew attention to\none factor which would have the effect of suppressing the value of the freehold\nreversion. To quote the material passage in full :\n39 When valuing the reversion to a standing house on the expiry of the\n50-year lease extension it is necessary to assume that Schedule 10 to the\nLocal Government and Housing Act 1989 applies to the tenancy.\nAccordingly the tenancy automatically continues until notice is served\nunder para 4 of Schedule 10, when the tenant is entitled to an assured\ntenancy under the Housing Act 1988 at a market rent. Mr Evans made a\ndeduction of £2 500 (or 1.75 per cent) from his standing house valuation\n2 [2012] UKUT 4 (LC); [2012] 1 EGLR 83 (George Bartlett QC (President) & N J Rose FRICS)\n3 [2007] EWCA Civ 1042, [2008] 1 WLR 2142\n4 See Haresign v St John the Baptist’s College, Oxford (1980) 255 EG 711, explained in the current\n(6th) edition of Hague : Leasehold Enfranchisement at para 9–16\n\nof £142 500 to reflect this provision. He accepted that the freehold interest\nin a house is significantly less attractive to a purchaser if it is subject to an\nassured tenancy than if it is vacant. He justified his very modest\ndeduction, however, by emphasising that what is to be assumed is not that\nthe tenant will continue in possession at the end of the 50-year extension,\nbut that the tenant will have the right to remain in possession. It was\nimpossible to know what the view of the tenant would be in 78.5 years'\ntime.\n40 It is true that the purchaser of the freehold reversion would have no\nmeans of knowing whether vacant possession would be gained at the end\nof the 50-year lease extension. In our view, however, the fact that there\ncan be no certainty of obtaining vacant possession would have a\nsignificant depressing effect on value and a substantially greater effect\nthan that suggested by Mr Evans. In the absence of any comparable\nevidence to indicate the scale of the appropriate deduction we conclude\nthat a purchaser would assume that the value of the eventual reversion\nwould be £114 000, equivalent to 80% of the full standing house value of\n£142 500.\n10. The transcript of the judgment does not reveal the evidential basis for concluding\nthat a reduction of 20% (as opposed to any other percentage) was appropriate.\nHowever, in the 6th edition of Hague5 at para 9–17 this is described as\n...controversial, since there was no evidence adduced to support it, and it\nis substantially higher than the traditional 10 per cent which was used to\ncalculate the risk of a statutory tenancy arising under Part 1 of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1954, and the much lower discount to reflect\n1989 Act rights : see paragraph 9–43.\nThis is a very lengthy paragraph, but after referring to the case of Lloyd-Jones v\nChurch Commissioners for England6 the material part reads :\nOn the evidence of that case, the Tribunal held that the landlord’s\nreversion after the original term date should be valued at the vacant\npossession value (less the value of tenant’s improvements) less 10 per cent\ndeduction for the risk of the tenant claiming a tenancy under Part 1 of the\n1954 Act, the resulting figure then being deferred at an appropriate\npercentage (the deferment rate) for the period of the unexpired term of\nthe tenancy.\nThis approach and method has been universally adopted and accepted by\nthe Lands Tribunal and leasehold valuation tribunals in subsequent cases\nboth in relation to Part 1 of the 1954 Act and Schedule 10 to the 1989 Act.\nIn either case, the appropriate deduction to take account of the tenant’s\nright is a matter of valuation evidence. It is not a convention so the fact\nthat a particular discount has been given on one set of facts in one case is\nnot relevant for the purpose of determining what the discount should be\nin another case...\n5 Hague : Leasehold Enfranchisement (6th ed – Sweet & Maxwell, 2014)\n6 [1982] 1 EGLR 209\n\n...Each case will depend on its own facts and evidence and some tribunals\nhave given discounts under the 1993 Act of up to 10 per cent for assured\ntenancy rights.7\n11. Section 27(2)(a) provides that the material valuation date is that on which the\napplication was made to the court. The claim was issued on 2nd January 2017, so\nthat is the material date to be applied. As the unexpired term exceeds 80 years\nno share of any marriage value is payable.8\n12. In most cases where there is a missing landlord, but perhaps surprisingly not in\nall, there will have been no rent paid for a substantial period before the date of\nthe application. Section 27(5) requires that the applicant must pay into court not\nonly the price payable, as determined by the tribunal, but also the amount or\nestimated amount remaining unpaid of any pecuniary rent payable for the house\nand premises up to the date of the conveyance. Section 166 of the Commonhold\nand Leasehold Reform Act 20029 imposes an interesting restriction upon that by\nproviding :\n“A tenant under a long lease of a dwelling is not liable to make a payment\nof rent under the lease unless the landlord has given him a notice relating\nto the payment; and the date on which he is liable to make the payment is\nthat specified in the notice.”\nThe limitation period for recovery of unpaid rent is 6 years, so that is the\nmaximum rent which could ever be recoverable.\nInspection and hearing\n13. The tribunal inspected the two properties at 10:00 on the morning of the hearing.\nAt the time the weather was cold and dry, but the ground was damp.\n14. The Old Forge comprises a pair of Victorian semi-detached cottages connected\ninternally only via a central rear extension. Viewed from the street, the remains\nof the old forge are located in a single storey wooden extension at the right hand\nend, just beyond a covered vehicular passageway secured by garage doors to the\nfront. The building sits next the road, centrally along one edge of a triangular site\nbordered to the rear by a stream, and with rough garden land to either side and\nat the rear. Sitting centrally to the rear are two brick outhouses, one of which is\nseverely distressed due to the presence of a tree growing through or leaning on\nit. Internally, the right hand cottage is extremely dated and requires complete\nmodernisation. It has two largish bedrooms (one over the passageway) reached\nvia a very wide landing at the top of the stairs. This probably doubled as a child’s\nwalk-through bedroom in former times. The cottage to the left appears to have\nbeen renovated in about the 1970s, with a fine polished timber framework all that\nis left of a former lath and plaster wall on the ground floor, a new timber\nstaircase, and built-in wardrobes in the bedrooms – one of which has a cabin bed.\nIt would seem that the rear extension was used as the kitchen for this, lived-in\nend of the building after the acquisition of both semi-detached parts.\n7 See also para 9–35 and the reference to Silvote Ltd v Liverpool City Council [2010] UKUT 192\n(LC), where the tribunal declined to apply a 10 per cent deduction where only 11 years were left\non the lease and there was no evidence to justify it\n8 LRA 1967, s.9(1E)\n9 In force from 28th February 2005\n\n15. Next door, White Gables comprises a modest detached bungalow built perhaps\nin the 1960s or possibly early 1970s, to which a large conservatory extension has\nbeen built at one end and a garage at the other. The garage extends to the eastern\nboundary. The premises sit well back from the road, between a good-sized front\ngarden and a very long rear one. To its west, separated by a hedge, trees and a\nside garden, lies the Old Forge. To its east, beyond a part-completed brick wall,\nlies another modest bungalow of perhaps similar vintage, but with a number of\nwindows facing towards it.\n16. When selling off the properties on either side the then owner of White Gables\nreserved the benefit for her adjoining land of\n...the right at any time to erect or suffer to be erected any buildings or\nother erections and alter any buildings or other erections now standing or\nhereafter to be erected on the transferor’s said adjoining property in such\nmanner as to obstruct or interfere with the passage of light or air to any\nbuilding which is or may be erected on the property.\n17. At the hearing both applicants were represented by Ms Kate Church, solicitor, of\nHewitsons. Expert valuation evidence was provided in each case by Robert C\nSadler FRICS, who had prepared two reports and answered questions from the\ntribunal upon their contents. In each report Mr Sadler sought to rely upon the\nvaluation principles, and in particular the adjustments to the Sportelli rate, that\nwere accepted by previous tribunals in June and October 2014 when determining\nthe sum to be paid into court for :\na. Green Cottage, 58 The Green, Weston Colville,10 and\nb. White Gates, Common Road, Weston Colville.11\n18. When challenged about the values he had attributed to each site value Mr Sadler\nargued that it was unlikely that one could replace the Old Forge with three\nmodern detached buildings, but with substantial modernisation and extension\nof the building that was already there (as two slightly linked houses plus forge)\none could anticipate a standing house value of £750 000.\n19. He also agreed that his value for White Gables may also be light, as that site could\nalso accommodate a more substantial building. The best evidence for that,\nhowever, was the sale that had been agreed for the subject property – until the\ntitle issue came to light– at a price of £375 000. The purchaser is still interested,\nbut at the lower price of £365 000 (even though it is the seller who has incurred\nthe effort and expense of bringing the claim and who will have to pay money into\ncourt). Questioned about his comparables, which are all on smaller sites with no\nsimilar opportunity for extension and/or redevelopment, Mr Sadler argued that\nthis is reflected in values of bungalows without that possibility, at c.£325 000.\nHe agreed that his comparables are on smaller individual plots, and that the\n“tone of the list” for that type of property is between £325 000 and £350 000.\nIf this were a cleared site, it would be back in the £250 000 category for the plot.\nFindings\n20. The Old Forge — The tribunal accepts that there are features, both internally\nwithin the main building and in the former forge extension itself, that could\n10 CAM/12UG/OAF/2013/0003\n11 CAM/12UG/OAF/2014/0006\n\njustify spot-listing, so valuation is best approached on the basis of a standing\nhouse that is ripe for modernisation and extension rather than on a vacant site\nbasis. On the assumption that the site can accommodate only the one large house\nthe tribunal attributes a built value to it of £750 000 and a site value (at 30%) of\n£225 000. The tribunal sees no reason to diverge from the yield and deferment\nrates, each of 6%, for which Mr Hallam had so persuasively argued in the case\nbefore this tribunal in April 2014 of Green Cottage, 58 The Green, Weston\nColville and which decision Mr Sadler now relied upon. Making a deduction of\n10% for Housing Act rights that produces a premium of £6 300 that is payable\ninto court. A detailed explanation appears in Schedule A.\n21. White Gables — While no listing constraints affect this property it does lie close\nto the adjoining bungalow and planners may care to impose some limitations on\nthe precise location, dimensions and layout of any modern house built to replace\nthe current bungalow (regardless of the rights reserved in the conveyances of\nboth adjoining properties). Taking account of the values of comparables which\nenjoy no potential for redevelopment and enlargement, the tribunal considers\nthat the most substantial house that might be achieved on this plot is likely to be\nless valuable than development next door, at The Old Forge. It attributes a value\nto any such property of £600 000, resulting in a bare site value of £180 000, at\nthe same 30% proportion as above. Applying the same yield and deferment rates,\nand the 10% deduction under Schedule 10, produces a premium of £5 050 that\nthe applicant must pay into court.

This is an application for dispensation from the consultation\nrequirements of S.20 Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. (the 1985 Act)\n2. The Applicant explains that urgent works are required to “replace\ndefective flat roof coverings to single storey element to rear of building\nover ground floor office and sanitary facilities”.\n3. The Tribunal made Directions on 15 November 2018 which required\nthe Applicant to send to the Respondent a copy of the application and\nthe Directions together with a form to be returned to the Tribunal\nindicating whether the application was agreed with, whether a written\nstatement was to be sent to the applicant and whether an oral hearing\nwas required. It was further stated that if the Respondent agreed to the\napplication or did not return the form she would be removed as a\nrespondent to the proceedings.\n4. No reply was received and there were no requests for an oral hearing.\nThe application is therefore determined on the papers received in\naccordance with Rule 31 of the Tribunal’s procedural rules.\n5. The only issue for the Tribunal is if it is reasonable to dispense with any\nstatutory consultation requirements. This decision does not\nconcern the issue of whether any service charge costs will be\nreasonable or payable.\nThe Law\n6. The relevant section of the Act reads as follows:\n20ZA Consultation requirements:\na. (1) Where an application is made to a Leasehold Valuation\nTribunal for a determination to dispense with all or any of the\nconsultation requirements in relation to any qualifying works or\nqualifying long-term agreement, the Tribunal may make the\ndetermination if satisfied that it is reasonable to dispense with\nthe requirements.\n7. The matter was examined in some detail by the Supreme Court in the\ncase of Daejan Investments Ltd v Benson. In summary the Supreme\nCourt noted the following\nb. The main question for the Tribunal when considering how to\nexercise its jurisdiction in accordance with section 20ZA (1) is\nthe real prejudice to the tenants flowing from the landlord’s\nbreach of the consultation requirements.\nc. The financial consequence to the landlord of not granting a\ndispensation is not a relevant factor. The nature of the landlord\nis not a relevant factor.\n2\n\nd. Dispensation should not be refused solely because the landlord\nseriously breached, or departed from, the consultation\nrequirements.\ne. The Tribunal has power to grant a dispensation as it thinks fit,\nprovided that any terms are appropriate.\nf. The Tribunal has power to impose a condition that the landlord\npays the tenants’ reasonable costs (including surveyor and/or\nlegal fees) incurred in connection with the landlord’s application\nunder section 20ZA (1).\ng. The legal burden of proof in relation to dispensation applications\nis on the landlord. The factual burden of identifying some\n“relevant” prejudice that they would or might have suffered is on\nthe tenants.\nh. The court considered that “relevant” prejudice should be given a\nnarrow definition; it means whether non-compliance with the\nconsultation requirements has led the landlord to incur costs in\nan unreasonable amount or to incur them in the provision of\nservices, or in the carrying out of works, which fell below a\nreasonable standard, in other words whether the non-\ncompliance has in that sense caused prejudice to the tenant.\ni. The more serious and/or deliberate the landlord's failure, the\nmore readily a Tribunal would be likely to accept that the\ntenants had suffered prejudice.\nj. Once the tenants had shown a credible case for prejudice, the\nTribunal should look to the landlord to rebut it.\nEvidence\n8. The Applicant refers to the water ingress into the ground floor unit due\nto a defective flat roof and has provided copies of two estimates\nobtained which detail the work involved.\nDetermination\n9. It is clear that delaying the repair of the flat roof can only cause further\ndamage to the fabric of the ground floor unit. The Lessee has not\nresponded to the Tribunal’s Directions and no evidence of the type of\nprejudice referred to in paragraph 7 above has been identified. In these\ncircumstances, I am prepared to grant the dispensation required.\n10. The Tribunal therefore grants dispensation from the\nconsultation requirements of S.20 Landlord and Tenant Act\n1985 in respect of the works to replace the flat roof serving\nthe communal structure of the building.\n11. In granting dispensation in respect of part of the Application\nthe Tribunal makes no determination as to whether any\nservice charge costs are reasonable or payable.\nD Banfield FRICS\n10 January 2019\n3\n\n1. A person wishing to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber) must seek permission to do so by making written application\nto the First-tier Tribunal at the Regional office, which has been dealing\nwith the case. The application must arrive at the Tribunal within 28\ndays after the Tribunal sends to the person making the application\nwritten reasons for the decision.\n2. If the person wishing to appeal does not comply with the 28-day time\nlimit, the person shall include with the application for permission to\nappeal a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28-day time limit; the Tribunal will then decide\nwhether to extend time or not to allow the application for permission to\nappeal to proceed.\n3. The application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of\nthe Tribunal to which it relates, state the grounds of appeal and state\nthe result the party making the appeal is seeking.\n4"

The parties to these proceedings are set out below.\n2. The Applicant, Buttercup Buildings Limited, is the freehold owner of the subject\nproperty. The Applicant’s managing director is Mr Kamlesh Kumar Anand, who\nwill be referred to in this determination as Mr K Anand.\n3. The Applicant’s managing agent is KPLA, whose director is Mr Ajay Anand, Mr K\nAnand’s son.\n4. Mr Rajesh Manji is the First Respondent, he is the husband of the Second\nRespondent, and they have been the joint leaseholder owners of the subject\nproperty since 28th October 2020.\n5. Mrs Manjulaben Manji is the Second Respondent.\n6. The subject property is Flat 11, Maison Alfort, 251 High Road, HA3 5EL (the\n“Property”) let to the Respondents by a lease dated 5th May 1972, granted for a\nterm of 99 years commencing 25th December 1971. It is a top floor one bedroom\nflat within a four storey purpose built block of 14 flats consisting of one and two\nbedroom properties.\n7. The relevant provisions of the lease are set out at paragraphs 8 to 14 below.\n8. The particulars of the lease contain the following definitions:\n(1) The Landlord is the registered proprietor of the property situate at and\nformerly known as 251 High Road Harrow Weald in the London Borough of\nHarrow All of which property is registered at Her Majesty's Land Registry\nwith Title Absolute under Title Number MX 277135 And all of which property\ncomprised in the said Title is hereinafter referred to as “the Estate”\n(2) The landlord has lately erected on part of the estate a block of 14 flats (which\nblock is hereinafter called “the Building”) …\n9.

Clauses 3(i) and\n3(ii) make provision for payments on account of the Applicant’s costs of carrying\nout its obligations under the lease (those obligations are dealt with in clause 4). By\nclause 3(i) the sum payable on account is £30.00 per annum, which today is a\nmodest sum.\n11. Clause 3(iii) deals with the balancing charge payable by the leaseholder, clause\n3(iv) deals with the accounting period, and clause 3(iv)(b) continues:\nThe maintenance charge payable hereunder shall be one fourteenth part of the\ntotal of the sum expended by the Landlord\n12. Clause 4 begins:\nSUBJECT to the Tenant duly paying to the Landlord the moneys payable under\nthe last foregoing clause hereof the Landlord HEREBY COVENANTS with the\ntenant\n13. Clause 4 continues by setting out the works, services and other costs that comprise\nthe service charges, including the following subclauses which allow the Applicant:\n(4) To defray such other costs as may be necessary to maintain the estate as a\ngood class residential Estate\n…\n(9) To employ a firm of Managing Agents to manage and maintain the Estate\nand the Building and to discharge all proper fees charges and expenses payable\nto such agents in connection therewith including the cost of computing and\ncollecting the maintenance charge\n14. As to insurance, clause 5(2) reads:\nThat the Landlord will keep the demised premises insured in the full value thereof\nagainst loss or damage by the insured risks in some well established Insurance\nOffice in the joint names of the Landlord and Tenant and any mortgagee of this\nLease whose name and address shall be notified to the Landlord for this purpose\nand will on request produce to the Tenant the policy or policies of insurance and\nthe receipts for the last premium in respect thereof And will layout any monies\nreceived under such insurance in rebuilding and reinstating the demised\npremises or such part there of as shall be destroyed or damaged\n15. Flats 4, 5, and 12 Maison Alfort, 251 High Road, HA3 5EL are let to Mr K Anand. A\ntotal of 6 flats in the Building are understood to be leased to Mr K Anand, his\nrelatives and/or officers of the Applicant company.\n16. The freehold title for Maison Alfort is registered at the Land Registry under title\nnumber MX277135. However, the ground floor garage block at Maison Alfort was\nremoved from this freehold title. It is no longer a garage block, and it’s currently a\nnon-residential space used as a warehouse/storage\n3\n\n17. According to Land Registry’s office copy entry, by a transfer dated 30th March 1999,\nownership of the garage block was transferred from Lalita Anand (Mr Kamlesh\nAnand’s wife), Parveen Anand and Ajay Anand to Mr K Anand. The garage block\nor car parking area is now held under title number NGL785257.\n18. An extract from the Land Registry’s title register dated 26th June 2020 shows that\nthe exterior roof and up to 100 feet of the air space above the Building, was leased\nto Mr Praveen Anand c/o Mr K. K. Anand on a 999 year lease at a peppercorn rent.\n19. On 18th March 2022, the Applicant Landlord, Buttercup Buildings Limited, issued\nclaim number J2QZ277T in the County Court Business Centre, seeking various\nsums from the Respondents comprising service charges of £2,175.14 for the year\nending 31st December 2020, and £1,741.73 for the year ending 31st December 2021.\nThe claim was subsequently transferred to the County Court at Willesden.\n20. On 3rd May 2022 the Respondents filed a Defence and Counterclaim in response to\nclaim number J2QZ277T.\n21. In the interim, the Respondents submitted an Application to the Tribunal dated 1st\nMay 2022 challenging the payability of service charges.\n22. By an order dated 18th May 2023, Deputy District Judge Brown transferred claim\nnumber J2QZ277T to the First-Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber).\n23. Subsequently, on 5th October 2023 the Applicants issued claim number K6QZ3P4J\nin the Civil National Business Centre seeking payment of £2,307.62 from the\nrespondents in respect of the Property.\n24. The Respondents’ Defence to that claim is dated 26th October 2023.\n25. Claim K6QZ3P4J was also transferred to the County Court at Willesden, and then\ntransferred to the First-Tier Tribunal by Deputy District Judge Cheesman by an\norder dated 5th April 2024.\n26. In a directions order dated 14th June 2024, the Tribunal set directions and listed\nthe matter for a final hearing on 18th October 2024. However, this final hearing\nwas adjourned. Paragraph F of the order dated 18th October 2024 reads:\nOn 17 October, the Applicant sent to the tribunal (by email) three separate\nbundles. None of the bundles were in the form provided for in the tribunal's\ndirections, and they appeared to be a jumble of emails, letters and service charge\ndocuments. The bundles did not appear to contain any documents dealing with\nthe respondents’ case.\n4\n\nThe Scope of the Application\n27. We remind ourself that these Applications are being determined pursuant to\nsection 27A. We are not determining an application made by the Respondents\nagainst the Applicant for breach of covenant. Consequently, in the interests of\nproportionality, we will address the various complaints raised by the Respondents\nonly to the extent that they are relevant to whether the service charges claimed by\nthe Applicant are payable. Therefore, we will not provide a substantive\ndetermination on extraneous matters.\n28. Mr K Anand states that the service charges claimed relate only to the parts of the\nEstate or Building that leaseholders have access to. We have seen no evidence that\nthe service charges in dispute relate to works and maintenance carried out in\nrespect of the roof space demised to Mr P Anand. In fact, other than their\nassertions, the Respondents have not provided evidence that undermines this\naspect of Mr K Anand’s evidence. Despite the Respondents submissions that they\nshould be liable for 1/16th of the total service charges based on ownership of the\nformer garage block and the roof space, we have determined the service charges\npayable in accordance with the terms of the lease and the proportion stipulated\ntherein, being 1/14th.\n29. Regarding being denied access to the garage block, in closing submissions, Mr P\nAnand disputes that leaseholders have any rights to park vehicles on the Estate by\nvirtue of garages being a condition of the planning permission granted. Mr P\nAnand relied on Arnold v Britton [2015] to interpret the lease, which he says does\nnot confer that right on leaseholders. In any event, Mr K Anand states service\ncharges relate to the areas on the Estate that leaseholders have access to.\n30. Similarly, the provisions under the lease determine the service charges that are\npayable under section 27A, irrespective of the allegation that the Applicant, other\ncompanies, and/or individuals associated with the Applicant may receive income\nor other benefits from the former parking area and the roof space. For\ncompleteness, we note that by clause 1 of the lease, the roof space is not included\nin the Respondents’ demise. Furthermore, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction\nto redistribute any benefits received from the telecommunications mast, as\nrequested by the Respondent.\nThe Tribunal Proceedings\n31. This matter had originally been listed for a final hearing on 18th October 2024. The\nApplicant had filed three separate bundles for that hearing, none of which\ncontained the Respondent’s documents. That hearing was adjourned by Judge\nMartyński who gave directions, including as to the format of the Applicant’s\nhearing bundle.\n32. Judge Martyński re-listed the matter for an inspection on 22nd January 2025,\nfollowed by the final hearing on 22nd and 23rd January 2025.\n5\n\n33. Accordingly, we inspected the Property and the Building and communal parts at\nMaison Alfort, 251 High Road, HA3 5EL at 10.00am on 22nd January 2025.\nDuring the inspection we were also shown a non-residential unit on the ground\nfloor which used to be part of the garage block.\n34. In addition to the Tribunal, the following were present during the inspection:\n34.1 Mr Kamlesh Anand;\n34.2 Mr Gaware, the Applicant’s solicitor;\n34.3 Mr Praveen Anand, Mr K Annand’s son and a consultant at the Applicant\ncompany;\n34.4 Mr Rajesh Manji; and\n34.5 Mr Patel, the Respondents’ counsel.\n35. Details of the Tribunal’s inspection are set out at paragraphs 36 to 54 below.\nGeneral\n36. Maison Alfort is a purpose built, four storey/ flat roofed block of 14 flats thought\nto have been constructed in the 1970s. The Property is laid out as two blocks\nconnected by a common stairwell and so is essentially H shaped in plan. There is\na further single storey extension to the rear which, we were advised, had\noriginally provided garage car parking that had extended under the rear ground\nfloor of the block. The flat roof over the extension had provided a veranda area\nand rear staircase exit to the rear yard but there was now no access to the veranda\nas the first floor access door off the common stairway was now permanently\nlocked.\n37. The external walls of the block were predominantly brick faced and presumed\ncavity construction. There were rendered and painted panels below those\nwindows adjacent the stairwell returns and the middle windows of the flank\nelevations which are likely blockwork construction. Separating floors were of\nsolid concrete construction. On the roof a telecommunication mast or masts had\nbeen constructed on the South block roof .\n38. There were 7 flats in each block with one flat at ground floor and two flats on each\nupper floor of each block. We were advised that seven flats were one bedroom\nunits and seven were two bedroom units.\n39. The main entrance faces East and onto the High Road. The block is surrounded\non the front and flank elevations by modest and sparsely grassed areas\nincorporating several large mature trees particularly to the front area. The rear\nplot was not accessible and surrounded by six foot timber fencing incorporating\nlocked timber panelled gates.\n40. The Tribunal toured the common parts including viewing an electrics cupboard\nand CCTV store room that were at ground floor. There was a skylight roof access\nin the top floor ceiling of the common parts but as it lacked fixed access the roof\nwas not viewed. The subject flat, Number11,was a single bedroom unit on the top\n6\n\nfloor of the North block. This flat was the only flat accessed by the Tribunal. The\nexternal areas were also viewed.\nConditions\n41. Internally and externally we were concerned to note numerous defects and\ndeficiencies with the Property. Our overall assessment was of a poorly\nmaintained and dated block. Matters noted included:-\nCommon Parts\n42. Discoloured and dated wall paintwork and including areas of damp damaged,\nblistered and mould stained plasterwork. Floor finishes were also stained and\nworn (The dismal impact of the conditions was particularly compounded at\nground to first floor where natural light was poor – likely the result of infilling\noriginal entrance area glazing and the fitting of a timber front door).\n43. Numerous missing and chipped vinyl floor tiles on landings and missing edge\nnosings to the stairway.( In addition to the potential trip hazards in this means\nof escape old vinyl tiles often have asbestos content).\n44. There were large accumulations of materials on some landings including\ncombustible materials and potential obstructions in the means of escape. There\nwere shared glazed fire lobbies for each pair of flats some of which had some\nfurnishings and/or storage. As shared lobbies this appeared to us to be\nunsuitable from a fire safety perspective. In one first floor lobby the ceiling\nplaster had been removed.\n45. Fire escape signage was minimal and the locked veranda door had a potentially\nmisleading fire exit direction sign affixed to it.\n46. The main electrics cupboard is under the stairs in the ground floor hall LACORS\nguidance is that that this siting should be avoided where possible but any\ncupboards should be of full fire resisting construction. This cupboard appeared\ninadequate. The door lacked smoke stops and intumescent strips. The floor was\nholed and there was debris on the floor. In addition to the usual domestic\nequipment the cupboard housed telecommunications mast power connections.\n47. Walls, stair rails and windows were festooned with numerous taped A4 printed\nnotices directed at tenants on issues such as storage in common parts. These\nappeared to us to have been very recently applied and seemed overbearing and\ndepressing additions to an already grim ambiance.\n48. In the Property we were shown an historic damp stain to the ceiling\napproximately 300mm x 100mm and in this position a past roof leak was\nconsidered the likely cause. We were also shown retro fitted surface mounted\ncopper pipework which the respondent claimed was installed by him after a\nproblem with the block’s plumbing.\n7\n\nExternal Areas\n49. There was no refuse chute or other provision for refuse storage inside the block\nsave for within the individual flats. Disposal was to unenclosed bulk bins near\nthe rear North flank corner. This was a significant distance from the block’s front\nentrance/exit and there was no rain protection to this route. The bins on our visit\nwere full to overflowing and refuse sacks had also been placed on adjacent street\nfurniture. In this location and with no enclosure the bins were accessible for non-\nresidents for refuse disposal and refuse could also be disturbed by birds and other\npests and be a source of nuisance from flies and odours.\n50. There was considerable historic water staining to brickwork – particularly on the\nNorth flank elevation where it had spread out from the top floor to 3-4 m wide at\nthe base. A past plumbing issue was indicated.\n51. The concrete surround to a drain cover near the front North corner was holed\nand appeared to allow potential for rat ingress and egress and possible odour\nproblems although none were evident on this visit.\n52. Although there was external lighting provision we were advised by the applicants\nthat this was no longer used.\n53. Viewed from the upper stairway windows and through gaps in the rear fencing\nthe now enclosed and locked rear areas were seen to have chaotic and unsightly\nstorage similar to a poorly run builders yard. The gates to the yard were in\nunsightly and in some despair with mismatched and water damaged panels and\nextensive flaking paintwork.\n54. There was staining to parapet brickwork on the rear elevation behind a rain water\ndown pipe of the South block. Paintwork to rendered panels below rear windows\nwas in poor condition.\nThe hearing\n55. The hearing began at 1.00pm on 22nd January 2025. At the start of the hearing,\nafter being told of the need to monitor Mr K Anand’s blood sugar, we suggested\nthe Tribunal should have periodic breaks, as and when requested by Mr K Anand,\nas a reasonable adjustment.\n56. Before the substantive hearing began, we orally listed the documents it had been\nprovided with for the hearing. The Applicant’s documents consisted of three\nhearing bundles, and we identified these bundles with reference to the page\ncount of each. We sought clarification that all the documents the parties wished\nus to rely on during the hearing had been listed, and the Applicant confirmed\nthat was the case. Although these bundles were not in the format directed by\nJudge Martyński, we were mindful of the previous adjournment, and the two-\nday listing of the adjourned hearing, we therefore considered the proportionate\napproach was to proceed with the hearing.\n8\n\n57. During the hearing in January 2025 the Applicant sought to rely on additional\nbundles beyond those listed at the outset. On numerous occasions during his\nevidence, Mr K Anand referred to documents supposedly in the bundles, which\nbundle it transpired we did not have. This resulted in numerous bundles being\nintroduced incrementally.\n58. Mr K Anand completed his oral evidence by the late afternoon on 23rd January\n2025. We then adjourned the matter part-heard to 7th March 2025 to hear\nevidence from the Respondents and closing submissions.\n59. Ahead of the adjourned hearing, the Respondents submitted an Order 1 form\ndated 4th February 2025 requesting specific disclosure. We refused the\napplication.\n60. We considered it inappropriate to admit additional documentary evidence at that\nstage, as the Applicant’s oral evidence had already been given. To admit evidence\nat that stage would deprive the Applicant of an opportunity to give evidence on\nany recently admitted documents. Furthermore, it would be disproportionate to\nrecall Mr K Anand to provide additional oral evidence to deal with any recently\nadmitted documents, which risked the hearing not finishing on 7th March 2025.\n61. All individuals present on 22nd and 23rd January 2025, except for Mr Gaware,\nattended the hearing on 7th March 2025. At the start of the hearing on 7th March\n2025, we gave the parties with a written list of all bundles submitted, and asked\nto be informed if any documents were missing.\n62. We reconvened without the parties on 6th May 2025 intending to deliberate.\nHowever, it became clear that material parts of the respondent’s lease were\nillegible due to poor quality.\nDocuments\n63. The contents of the list we complied of the documents submitted by the parties\nfor the hearing on 21st and 22nd January 2025 (and also used on 7th March) is\nset out below.\n64.

The Respondents’ Documents:\n65.1 Respondent’s skeleton\n65.2 Application for costs\n65.3 Application to adduce a 2nd witness statement\n65.4 R’s authorities\n65.5 Bundle for hearing 22-1-2025\n65.6 R’s Application dated\n66. As stated, at the reconvened hearing on 7th March 2025 we heard evidence from\nthe Respondent, and closing submissions from both parties.\n67. Mr P Anand gave oral closing submissions on behalf of the Applicant. At times\nhis submissions strayed into giving evidence. When this occurred, we asked him\nto discontinue giving evidence, explaining that we would not take into account\nevidence given during closing submissions.\n68. In his submissions, Mr Patel argued that the Applicant failed to comply with\nsection 20 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 before appointing managing\nagents pursuant to an alleged qualifying long term agreement. We identified\nCorvan (Properties) Limited v Abdel-Mahmoud [2018] EWCA Civ 1102 as a\nrelevant authority on this point which neither party had referred to.\n69. Given that the managing agent’s fees constituted between 25% to 33% of the\ndisputed service charges, we deemed it proportionate to allow the parties to make\nsubmissions on how this authority should be applied in the present case. We gave\ndirections for written submissions after the hearing, to address whether the\nterms of the written agreements between the Applicant and managing agents\n10\n\nconstituted a qualifying long term agreement as defined by section 20 of the\nLandlord and Tenant Act 1985 and paragraph 4 of the Service Charges\n(Consultation Requirements) (England) Regulations 2003 SI No 1987 in light of\nthe decision in Corvan.\n70. The parties were informed that any submissions that went beyond addressing the\nmanaging agent’s agreement in light of Corvan, would not be taken into account.\n71. The totality of the documentation submitted by the Applicant was excessive, and\nthey were disorderly. The quantity of documents is detailed in paragraphs 64 to\n65.6 above. The bundles were also not prepared in accordance with the directions\norders dated 14th June 2024 and 18th October 2024. Managing this quantity of\nbundles was extremely difficult, particularly as the indexes were\nincomprehensible. That was exacerbated by confusing pagination; pages were\nmarked with numbers (sometimes duplicated) that did not correspond with their\nposition in the bundle, and internally the documents were not arranged logically,\nfor instance, chronologically or by category. The vast majority of the\ndocumentation was prepared by the Applicant, such as invoices and agreements,\nwhich were difficult to follow. This state of the documents significantly prolonged\nthe hearing, which took 3½ days including deliberation, rather than the 2-day\ntime estimate.\n72. Navigating these bundles was time-consuming, and it was also impossible to\ncross-reference the Scott schedule with the Applicant’s bundles.\n73. Furthermore, during the hearing on 22nd and 23rd January 2025 Mr K Anand\ndisplayed obvious irritation, frustration, and at times visible anger at the time\ntaken to navigate the bundles. At other times during the hearing he was\npatronising, and sometimes belligerent towards Mr Patel, for instance by\nrefusing to answer his questions, responding with “no comment”, or criticising\nMr Patel’s questions as stupid or unprofessional. Mr K Anand was also rude to\nthe Tribunal, including expressly querying whether its members had the relevant\nexpertise.\nPost Hearing\n74. We reconvened on 6th May 2025 to deliberate. The case officer informed us that\nthe parties had not sent the requested written submissions (see paragraphs 68 to\n70 above). It also became apparent during our deliberations, that the multiple\ncopies of the lease for the Property that had been provided in various bundles,\nwere all poor quality, and certain clauses were completely illegible.\n75. Therefore, on 7th May 2025 we issued directions requiring the parties to provide\ntheir written submissions, and directing the Respondents provide a good quality\ncopy of the lease. The Respondents replied explaining both sides had already sent\ntheir written submissions, and re-sent them. Regarding providing a copy of the\nlease, the respondents stated they couldn’t provide this because HM Land\nRegistry did not hold a copy of the lease.\n11\n\n76. On 19th May 2025 we issued further directions instructing the Applicant to\nprovide a good quality copy of the Property’s lease or a sample lease for another\nflat within the Building containing the same terms. On 28th May 2025 the\nApplicant sent an unsolicited 24-page document containing submissions, but did\nnot provide a copy of the lease. On 13th June 2025 we issued a “minded to strike\nout notice”, informing the Applicant that we were minded to strike out the\nApplication due to non-compliance with the Tribunal’s directions, including the\nfailure to provide a good quality copy of the lease. The Applicant was also\ninformed that we would not consider the document submitted on 28th May 2025.\n77. The Respondents’ submissions urged us to strike out the Application. The\nApplicant requested that the Application not be struck out, and provided an\nadequate copy of the lease for the Property, although various clauses on that copy\nhad been highlighted. There was no explanation as to why this copy of the lease\nhad not been submitted previously.\n78. The documents submitted by the parties post hearing include the following:\n78.1 The Applicant’s written submissions regarding Corvan (requested by the\nTribunal);\n78.2 The Respondent’s written submissions regarding Corvan (requested by\nthe Tribunal);\n78.3 An e-mail from the respondent attaching a letter from Land Registry\nstating the latter did not hold a copy of the Property’s lease (responding\nto the Tribunal’s request);\n78.4 An Order 1 form from the respondent dated 12th May 2025 requesting\npermission to expand the scope of the written submissions (not\nrequested by the Tribunal);\n78.5 A 24-page document e-mailed by the Applicant on 28th May 2025 titled:\n“2MAISON ALFORT.FLAT 11 SUBMISSION STATEMENT 28.02.2025\n(not requested by the Tribunal).\n79. In the interests of managing documentation, and of proportionality, we directed\nthat the Applicant must e-mail, not post documents to the Tribunal. The\nApplicant objected to this, and relying on rule 16(8) to dispute our authority to\nmake this direction.\n80. At paragraph 3 of the order dated 19th May 2025, we explained our reasons for\nthis direction, and why rule 16(8) does not preclude us making this direction.\nHowever, the Applicant continues to complain about this direction. Our direction\nregarding e-mailing, and not sending, documents to the Tribunal still stands, for\nthe reasons previously given.\n12\n\nThe issues\n81. The issue for determination is the reasonableness of service charges, the global\namounts claimed for the years ending 31st December 2020 amounting to\n£29,751.96, 31st December 2021 for £25,384.28, and 31st December 2022 for\n£28,727.42. Different amounts are claimed in some of the documents, but the\nApplicant clarified at the hearing, that these were the sums claimed, and they\nwere the amounts stated on the Expenditure Account prepared by the\naccountants.\n82. The Applicant’s position is that the respondents are liable to contribute 1/14th of\nthese costs. In challenging these costs, Mr Patel based his arguments on service\ncharges for the year ending 31st December 2020, but stating the points he made\nwere equally applicable to subsequent years.\n83. We reached our decision after considering the oral and written evidence,\nincluding documents referred to in that evidence, and based on our assessment\nof the evidence.\n84. This determination does not refer to every matter raised by the parties, or every\ndocument reviewed or taken into account. However, this does not imply that any\npoints raised, or documents not specifically mentioned, were disregarded. If a\npoint or document was relevant to a specific issue and referred to in the evidence\nor submissions, we considered it.\n85. We made findings on various categories of service charges at paragraphs 88 to\n164 below. The determination on the specific items challenged are set out in the\ntables following paragraph 164.\nService Charges due prior to the Respondent’s Ownership\n86. The Respondents position is that they are not liable for any service charges for\nthe year ending 31st December 2020 because these were paid by the previous\nowner of the Property. Alternatively, they claim they are only liable for service\ncharges from 28th October 2020, when the lease was assigned to them.\n87. To support this argument they rely on paragraph (e) of the leasehold enquiries\nsection on the third page of the “Report on Proposed Purchase of Flat 11”. This\ndocument contains a proposal that the seller’s solicitors retain £11,929.54 for\nservice charge arrears claimed from the Respondent’s predecessor in title. The\ndocument seeks confirmation that the Respondents agree to this, and they say\nthat they did agree to this. As Mr P Anand pointed out, the Respondents were\nlegally represented when they purchased the Property, and they should have\nbeen advised to retain relevant legal documents for resolving disputes such as\nthis. However, there is no correspondence from the seller’s or the respondent’s\nsolicitors confirming the proposed retention was agreed and/or actioned. Mr\nPatel also did not address whether, and if so how, the provisions of the Landlord\nand Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 apply to this issue. Absent clarification on this\npoint, coupled with the failure to provide supporting documentation, the\n13\n\nRespondents have failed to prove that on the balance of probabilities that they\nare not liable for service charges for the whole of the year ending 31st December\n2020.\nInsurance\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n88. We find the amount payable for insurance is £0.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n89. Clause 5(2) of the lease deals with insurance (see paragraph 14 above).\n90. Mr K Anand’s evidence on 22nd January 2025 was that the insurance was arranged\nthrough a third party broker, he said that he also personally tested the market\nhimself to ensure the premium charged to leaseholders was reasonable. Mr K\nAnand also confirmed the building insurance policy was solely in the Applicant\ncompany’s name. He initially refused to answer questions about the scope of the\ninsurance cover, but when pressed, he said that the policy applied only to the\nresidential parts of the Building. He said the non-residential premises were not\ninsured, and in the event of a disaster such as a fire, the Applicant would bear the\nloss. Mr Patel pressed Mr K Anand further about this. He asked Mr K Anand why\nthe insurance broker’s invoice dated 23 November 2024 described the policy as\n“commercial property owners insurance.” He also asked why the policy included\nbusiness interruption if it was a residential policy. Mr K Anand was adamant the\ninsurance costs claimed from leaseholders did not include cover for the non-\nresidential premises.\n91. Mr Patel relied on the case of Green v 180 Archway Road Management Co Ltd\n[2012] UKUT 245 (LC) where the Upper Tribunal held that where a lease required\nthe landlord obtains insurance in the joint name of the landlord and tenant, but\nthe landlord failed to do so, the tenant was not liable for the insurance premiums.\nMr P Anand sought to distinguish this on the basis that in this lease, insurance is\npaid as additional rent. Mr Patel added that the insurance was of no benefit to the\nleaseholders, because when the Respondent wanted to make an insurance claim\nfor a leak into his property, he received no response from the Applicant to his\nenquiries. In the end, the Respondent paid for to repair the damage caused by the\nleak himself.\n92. We find the express provisions of the lease require insurance is taken out in joint\nnames. The Applicant accepts that, in breach of those provisions, for the periods\nin dispute, insurance was in the Applicant’s name only. In light of the binding\nauthority in Green, we conclude that the Respondents are not liable for the\ninsurance premiums being claimed. We reject the Applicant’s argument that\nGreen should be distinguished. The insurance payable in this case meets the\nstatutory test of being a service charge as defined by section 18(1) which includes\namounts paid “as part of or in addition to rent.” Given that service charges\n14\n\nrecoverable as rent are treated the same under the legislation, consistency requires\nthey should not be distinguished by case law.\nElectricity\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n93. We find the amount claimed for electricity is not reasonable. The sum claimed is\nreduced to £982.16 for the year ending 2020, to be increased according to the\nconsumer price index for subsequent years.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n94. The Applicant’s evidence of the electricity costs included two estimated electricity\nbills from E-on. The first is dated 11 January 2020 for £487.69, the second is dated\n16 April 2020 for £494.47. The Respondent offered £982.16 for electricity, which\ncorresponds to the total of the estimated bills provided by the Applicant. The\nApplicant also issued an invoice to leaseholders for £1,300 for electricity, which\nMr K Anand explained was to make provision for these costs.\n95. Mr Patel challenged Mr K Anand about why two bills had been provided for only\nsome of the costs claimed, and why those were estimated bills. Mr Patel also\ncalculated (as do we) that the total of the estimated bills and the KPLA invoice\ncame to £2,282.16, being less than the £2,302.45 being claimed by the Applicant.\n96. Mr Patel also asked whether the electricity charges passed on to leaseholders\nincluded usage by the telecommunication mast and/or the non-domestic\npremises. The Applicant denied this, asserting that the mast had a separate meter\nand was billed independently. The Respondent’s evidence tended to support this:\nhe accepted during cross examination that during the inspection in January 2025\nwhen the electricity to the common parts was turned off, the lights in the ground\nfloor warehouse remained on. This suggests the electricity is supplied separately.\n97. We noted that irrespective of the account number on the bills (which may change\nfor a variety of reasons) the E-on bills specifically stated the supply was for the\ncommon parts. We found no evidence that electricity for the telecoms mast or non-\nresidential areas was included in the charges to leaseholders. The fact that the\nwarehouse lighting remained operational when the common parts’ electricity was\noff further supported this.\n98. Therefore, we consider £982.16 to be a reasonable amount for the electricity\ncharges. For subsequent years, this figure was used as a baseline and adjusted\naccording to the Consumer Price Index for 2021 and 2022.\n15\n\nAccountancy Fee\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n99. We find the accountancy fees are not yet payable because they have not been\ndemanded in accordance with clauses 3(1) and 3(iv)(b) of the lease.\n100. If the accountancy fees are demanded in accordance with the terms of the lease,\nwe consider the amount that is reasonable is £250.00 per year excluding any\nVAT that may be due on the fees.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n101. Mr Patel questioned Mr K Anand about the absence of invoices or fee notes for\nthe accountant’s costs. Mr K Anand stated that the accountant, who treated him\nlike a father, would only invoice him once leaseholders had paid their service\ncharges. Effectively, his evidence was that the accountant had extended him\ncredit for the accountancy service. Mr K Anand expected an invoice would be\nissued in due course. The £400 plus VAT claimed was Mr K Anand’s estimate\nof what the accountant would eventually charge.\n102. Mr Patel challenged the legitimacy of the accountancy fees, arguing that they\nwere not reasonably incurred or alternatively should be no more than £250. He\npointed out that the lease did not require the accounts to be certified by an\naccountant and further criticised the quality of the accountant’s service, citing\nerrors such as the miscalculation of electricity charges and building costs.\n103. Despite the absence of any express provision in the lease, we consider it is open\nto the Applicant to treat the preparation of service charge accounts as necessary\nin accordance with clause 4(4) of the lease. It is now common for service charge\naccounts to be prepared, and for transparency, we consider it is reasonable to\nengage an accountant to prepare service charge accounts.\n104. However, given the quality of the service, including the miscalculations and the\nabsence of adequate third party invoices, we conclude that the Respondent’s\noffer is a reasonable amount £250. This amount will not be adjusted for\ninflation, as the figure claimed by the Applicant has remained unchanged in\nsubsequent years.\n105. Despite the above, we conclude the accountancy fees are not currently payable.\nThat is because these costs have not been paid out. The Applicant was effectively\nseeking to make provision for a future cost. However, the lease only allowed for\na £30 annual payment on account of service charge costs, with any additional\nsums to be recovered through a balancing charge once actually incurred.\nTherefore, under the terms of the lease, the Applicant is not entitled to claim\nthis £250 in advance.\n16\n\nBuilding Repairs, Maintenance and Renewals\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n106. We consider the amounts claimed by the Applicant are reasonable, being £1,210\nfor the year ending 2020, £555.00 for the year ending 2021, and £440 for the\nyear ending 2022.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n107. When questioned about the contractors responsible for the works covered by\nthe claimed expenditure, Mr K Anand initially refused to provide the\ncontractors’ names. After being pressed, he identified a man named John, and\nwhen pressed further for John’s last name, said it was Williams. He also said\nMr Williams is self-employed. Mr K Anand explained that Mr Williams does not\nissue invoices for the work he performs for the Applicant, and that he is paid in\ncash directly by Mr K Anand. When asked whether KPLA, the Applicant’s\nmanaging agent, issued invoices for the work carried out by contractors, Mr K\nAnand responded that because KPLA was his own company, he did not need to\nproduce invoices.\n108. Further questioning about who else carried out repairs or maintenance were\nalso met with resistance. Eventually, Mr K Anand mentioned another individual\nnamed Ram, though he did not provide a last name. Mr K Anand also stated\nthat his son, Ajay Anand, performed some of the work.\n109. When asked how the £1,210 charged for repairs, maintenance, and renewals\nwas calculated, Mr K Anand said he didn’t know how the accountant calculated\nthat figure.\n110. Mr Patel raised concerns about the credibility of the invoices submitted by\nKPLA. He questioned why certain repairs appeared to be repeated annually,\nsuch as the replacement of the main door hinges in both 2020 and 2021. Mr K\nAnand attributed this to vandalism and general damage, claiming residents do\nnot look after the Building. Mr Patel also pointed out that two invoices for\nrepairs to wall lights in the communal hallway were dated exactly one year\napart. Mr Patel put to Mr K Anand that this indicated the invoices were\nfabricated. Mr K Anand’s response was that he made no comment. When Mr\nPatel put to him that he had not denied the allegation, Mr K Anand repeated\nthat he made no comment.\n111. Despite the poor documentation surrounding the charges, and Mr K Anand\nbeing unforthcoming in his evidence, we conclude that the costs claimed for\nrepairs, maintenance, and renewals are reasonable. Given the size and age of\nthe building, we find it more likely than not that some level of work would have\nbeen necessary, and therefore considered the amount claimed to be reasonable.\n17\n\nCleaning and Garden Maintenance\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n112. We find the amounts claimed for gardening and maintenance are not\nreasonable, and we reduce these from £3,826.25 to £1,750.00 for the year\nending 31st December 2020, to be increased according to the consumer price\nindex for subsequent years.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n113. Mr K Anand gave oral evidence explaining that a contractor named Ram is\nresponsible for both cleaning and gardening services at the Property. Ram uses\nequipment provided by KPLA to carry out the gardening work. According to Mr\nK Anand, KPLA charges £35.00 per hour for Ram’s labour, of which £15.00 is\npaid to Ram in cash. The remaining £20.00 is retained by KPLA to cover\ncommission and other unspecified overheads.\n114. When asked to clarify the services Ram provides, Mr K Anand stated that Ram\ncleans the common parts, including the hall, landings, stairs, and outside litter,\nfor one hour per week. He also stated that Ram had spent six hours cleaning the\nprevious week, namely the week before our inspection. For gardening, Ram is\nsaid to cut the grass and other general garden maintenance, which takes\nbetween 1.5 to 2 hours per week.\n115. The Respondent criticised the quality of both cleaning and gardening. He\nobserved that the common parts above the first floor were not cleaned and that\nthe grass was uncut during his visits. However, under cross-examination, the\nRespondent accepted he had not submitted any formal complaints about these\nissues, saying there were other matters he had to deal with. The Respondent\nalso accepted he had not provided photographic evidence to support his\naccount. Mr Patel’s skeleton argument notes these costs exceed £250 per\nleaseholder, but claims there has been a failure to consult leaseholders.\nHowever, that was not put to the Applicant, nor in our judgment, do these\namount to qualifying works.\n116. We found it unreasonable for the managing agent to charge both a management\nfee and an additional commission of £20.00 per hour on routine services like\ncleaning and gardening, particularly a commission at such a high rate. Charging\na commission is contrary to the practice recommended by RICS. Therefore, we\nconcluded that it was unreasonable for leaseholders to pay more than the actual\namount received by the contractor.\n117. Based on the condition of the Building and outside area, we determined that the\nclaimed three hours of weekly service was not reflected in the results.\n18\n\nParticularly taking into account that Ram spent six hours cleaning the common\nparts the week before. We found that two hours per week was a reasonable\namount of time for both cleaning and gardening, with some seasonal variation\nfor gardening. We calculate that equates to £1,750.00 for 2020, and it is\nconsistent with the maximum amount offered by the Respondents.\nManaging Agents Fees (£600 per flat)\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n118. We considers the management fee for 2020 is not reasonable, and reduce this\namount to £200 for 2020, to be increased according to the consumer price\nindex for subsequent years.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision regarding the costs\n119. Mr K Anand gave evidence that KPLA has managed the Property for over 45\nyears. His son, Mr A Anand, is the sole director of KPLA, while Mr K Anand acts\nas a consultant and handles the day-to-day management of the Building. Mr K\nAnand states he is a charted management accountant by profession, and has\naround 40 years of experience in property management. Although he\nacknowledged being aware of the RICS Service Charge Residential\nManagement Code, he admitted he was not familiar with its contents.\n120. Mr K Anand says that KPLA typically charges £600 per flat for block\nmanagement, a fee that has increased annually since 2020. The management\nagreement by which the Applicant engages KPLA to manage the Building was\nsigned by Mr K Anand in his capacity as managing director of the Applicant\ncompany. When asked whether the terms of the management agreement,\nincluding the fee, were discussed with Mr A Anand (as KPLA’s director), Mr K\nAnand said they were not. He continued that he does not need to discuss the\nterms because it is a family company, and he is head of the family. He said the\nApplicant company and KPLA are the same: KPLA manages the Applicant’s\nmultiple freehold blocks. Finally, Mr K Anand stated that he fixed the managing\nagent fee based on his assessment of the market rate.\n121. The Respondent relied on an alternative quotation from Woodwards managing\nagents, who, after inspecting the Building, quoted £250 per flat to manage the\nBuilding, including cleaning, maintenance, and arranging insurance, for £250\nplus VAT per flat per year. The Respondent accepted that Woodwards had\nminimal documentation to base its quote on.\n122. Regarding the condition of the Building, Mr K Anand claimed this was due to\nleaseholders, including the Respondents, failing to pay their service charges. He\nalso suggested that the Applicant’s obligations under clause 4 of the lease are\nnot engaged because the Applicant’s performance of clause 4 is subject to the\nRespondents paying the service charges, which they have failed to pay.\n19\n\n123. However, the Applicant made no submissions as to why or how clause 4 may\njustify, what we found during the inspection, to be a poorly maintained block.\nIn particular, the Applicant advanced no argument as to whether or why clause\n4 may be a condition precedent. Nor was there any argument as to whether the\nrespondents had failed to “duly” pay sums owed. Given that so far there has\nbeen no determination of the amount payable by the respondents, it is not clear\nwhy the Applicant maintains the Respondents have failed to duly pay.\n124. Aside from the condition of the Building, Mr Patel questioned the quality of\nKPLA’s management, particularly its failure to respond to the Respondent’s e-\nmails (see paragraph above). Mr K Anand claimed he did not have to respond\nbecause the Respondent had not paid his service charges, though he said he had\nreported the leak to the insurer himself. However, no evidence of this was\nprovided.\n125. Mr Patel put it to Mr K Anand that the agreement with the managing agent is\nnot genuine, Mr K Anand vigorously denied this.\n126. The Respondent’s position is that the managing agent’s fee should be limited to\n£100 because the agreement is a qualifying long term agreement yet there has\nbeen no statutory consultation.\n127. An important area of property management is fire safety. This requires\narranging for appropriately qualified individuals to carry out the relevant\ninspections and testing, and for fire risk assessments to be regularly reviewed,\nand after any changes in conditions or any fire incidents (see paragraphs 43 to\n46 above). During the inspection we saw a number of fire safety deficiencies.\nFor example, debris and furniture in the lobby, which could impede escape\nduring a fire. Past photographs in the Respondent’s bundle indicate this was\nrelevant historically, which also indicates chronic failings to meet appropriate\nfire safety standards. During the hearing we asked Mr K Anand about what fire\nrisk assessments KPLA had arranged in respect of the Property. He stated the\nmost recent fire risk assessment was carried out in 2018, but this was not\nprovided for our evaluation. As to the electrical installation, this should be\ninspected every 5 years, but Mr K Anand didn’t know when this was last done.\nHe accepted that the time that had elapsed since the last risk assessment and/or\nelectrical inspection could potentially jeopardise insurance cover. In answer to\nother questions from the Tribunal, Mr K Anand confirmed that KPLA is not a\nmember of any landlord associations, nor of any redress scheme.\n128. These responses, combined with the condition of the Building when we\ninspected it, leads us to conclude that the costs claimed for property\nmanagement are unreasonable. While Woodward’s quotation was based on\nlimited information, it provides some guidance as to the local market rate.\nBecause we find the property management is below the standard we expect\nfrom professional managing agents, we consider an amount equivalent to 80%\nof the quotation from Woodwards to be reasonable.\n20\n\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision regarding section 20\n129. We have applied the guidance in Corvan, to determine whether the\nmanagement agreement is a qualifying long term agreement. A summary of that\nguidance states we should take into account (i) the natural and ordinary\nlanguage; (ii) any other relevant provisions of the lease (iii) the overall purpose\nof the clause and lease; (iv) the facts and circumstances; and (v) commercial\ncommon sense. Corvan also held that an agreement is a qualifying long term\nagreement where its terms stipulate that is must last for more than 12 months.\n130. The management agreement in this case is very poorly drafted, and contains\ntypological errors. However, we have concluded that the natural meaning of the\nwords used is that it is an agreement expressed to be for 12 months, that may\nrollover, but may also be terminated on or before 12 months.\n131. The agreement contains three provisions dealing with termination, which are\ndealt with below.\n132. The first two of these provisions are set out as alternatives, both of which are at\nclause 1.2. The first of those reads: “This agreement can be terminated with\nEffect from expiry”\n133. We find this provision means, if invoked, termination of the agreement takes\neffect on expiry of the agreement. As stated, because the agreement is for 12\nmonths, this means the agreement may be terminated at the 12-month point.\nSo this would not be more than 12 months.\n134. The second provision at clause 1.2 reads: “OR by either party giving notice in\nwriting of a minimum of 3months”\n135. We consider this means that either party can give notice of termination at any\ntime, providing it is in writing and gives 3 months’ notice.\n136. Finally, clause 1.5 reads (original emphasis and capitalisation):\nThis Agreement is for (12 months) it will be roll over on an annual Basis\nOnly (of 12 months) if notice to terminate is not given TO THE COMPANY from\nthe freeholder BUTTERCUP BUILDINGS LIMITED of the property before the\nend of Financial year i.e. 31st. December.2020\n137. By clause 1.5, the agreement will rollover after 12 months if notice is not given,\nmeaning it is not mandatory that it will last more than 12 months.\n138. In accordance with Corvan, having regard to the natural meaning of the\nlanguage used, and in all the circumstances, as the management agreement\ncould last for 12 months or less, we conclude it is not a qualifying long term\nagreement.\n21\n\nLegal Costs Awarded to LB Harrow\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n139. These costs are not payable, and the amount claimed is reduced to £0\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n140. In cross examination Mr K Anand reiterated the account contained in the Scott\nschedule. He explained this item relates to London Borough of Harrow’s legal\ncosts for bringing a prosecution in respect of an improvement notice served on\nthe Applicant. Although the prosecution was withdrawn, the magistrates’ court\nordered the Applicant to pay Harrow’s legal costs of bringing the prosecution.\nMr K Anand explained the Applicant has not yet paid Harrow’s costs, but is\nclaiming this from leaseholders pursuant to clause 4(4) to make provision for\nthese costs.\n141. Mr Patel asked which provisions of the lease entitled the Applicant to recover\nthese costs from leaseholders. The Applicant did not address this, and we\ncannot see any clause within the lease that allows the Applicant to recover a\nthird party’s legal costs for proceedings in which the Applicant faced\nprosecution.\n142. Accordingly, in our judgment, these costs are not payable by the Respondents.\n8% Interest on Sums Borrowed Pursuant to Clause 4(4)\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n143. These costs are not payable, and the amount claimed is reduced to £0\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n144. According to the Scott schedule, the Applicant relied on clause 3(iv)(b) of the\nlease (see paragraph 91 above) to support the claim for interest. It also relied on\nparagraph 3(b) of the order dated 6th July 2021 made by the Leasehold\nValuation Tribunal (the “LVT”) when appointing a manager. The LVT’s order\nstated the manager was entitled to borrow money to cover service charge\nexpenditure and recover the associated costs of those loans through the service\ncharges.\n145. Mr K Anand reiterated this justification in his oral evidence. He added that\nbecause most leaseholders do not pay their service charges, the Applicant has\ninsufficient funds to fulfil its obligations under the lease. Therefore, the interest\nclaimed relates to the sums that he lends to the Applicant every year to fulfil its\nobligations. When asked for documents showing loan payments from him to\nthe Applicant, Mr K Anand clarified that he doesn’t pay the money over to the\n22\n\nApplicant. Instead he holds the funds to make provision to meet a shortfall of\nfunds.\n146. He also said explained the 8% interest rate reflects the county court rate, and is\nan appropriate rate for an unsecured loan. When asked by Mr Patel about how\nthe terms of the loan were agreed, Mr K Anand responded that he did not\ndiscuss the terms with anyone because he lent the money to the company, and\nhe is managing director of the company, so there was no one to discuss it with.\n147. We conclude interest is not payable by the leaseholders for the following\nreasons. Firstly the LVT’s order dealt with the management functions and\nauthority of a manager appointed by the Tribunal. The Applicant was not\nappointed by the Tribunal, so there is no basis for it to rely on the LVT’s order\nto claim interest. The second reason is that Mr K Anand’s evidence is that he\nhas not actually loaned any money to the Applicant, instead he has ring-fenced\nfunds which he would lend to the Applicant if required. As a matter of common\nsense, we do not consider Mr K Anand can recover interest on sums that he has\nnot actually lent. Finally, the Applicant is essentially seeking a payment on\naccount of interest, and as previously stated, payments on account are limited\nto £30.00 per year, whereas the amount claimed here would be £142.86 per\nleaseholder.\nRenting a Room for Safe Storage of CCTV & Entry System\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n148. We find the amount claimed for renting a room is not reasonable. The sum\nclaimed is reduced to £1,820.00 for the year ending 2020, to be increased\naccording to the consumer price index for subsequent years.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n149. Mr K Anand claimed that vandalism and trespassing justified the installation of\nCCTV, and this was not seriously contested. Mr K Anand also says the Applicant\nwas advised to install a CCTV system that had monitors rather than a system\nthat could be viewed remotely. In reality, the main issue was whether a secure\ncupboard would suffice to store the monitors, whether renting a room was\ngenuinely necessary for storing monitors, and/or if the rented room was being\nused for other purposes.\n150. The Applicant submitted a document titled “Room Rental Agreement” dated 2\nJanuary 2018, which identifies Mr Kamlesh Kumar Anand as the landlord and\nthe Applicant company as the tenant. Invoices for rent payments were issued\nby Kamlesh K. Anand & Co. (and not issued by the owner, Mr K Anand) to the\nApplicant. We have been provided with some invoices dated 30 March, 30 June,\nand 28 September 2020, showing rent payments were made by KPLA, acting as\nthe Applicant’s agent. Receipts for these payments were signed by Mr K Anand\nin his capacity as the freehold owner of the warehouse.\n23\n\n151. The Respondent complains about these arrangements on a number of grounds.\nFirstly, he objects to paying rent for a space which he says he should have access\nto anyway, because clause 1(ii) of the lease grants access over common areas\nsuch as roadways and forecourts, which he says includes the former garage\nblock. Mr Patel also referred to the 1970 planning permission granted by\nHarrow Council, which allowed for the construction of flats and garages, with a\ncondition that the land be used exclusively for domestic purposes for the benefit\nof the flat occupiers. He cited paragraph 8 of the planning permission, which\nreinforced this restriction.\n152. Additionally, Mr Patel claims that the room that leaseholders are being asked\nto pay for, is being used for other purposes, for instance to store equipment for\nthe telecommunications masts. He relies on the inspection when he said this\nroom had more than the CCTV monitors in it\n153. According to the Applicant’s oral and written evidence, the flats were sold\nwithout car parking spaces, and the garages remained under the Applicant’s\nownership. The Applicant also claimed that in 2010, the London Borough of\nHarrow authorised a change of use for the area now used as warehousing, from\ndomestic to non-domestic use.\n154. We agree with a point made by Mr P Anand that obtaining planning permission\non condition that car parking is available, on its own, does not entitle the\nRespondents to car parking under their lease. We also agree with the Applicant\nthat the lease does not provide for parking.\n155. We consider it was reasonable to install CCTV, and on the advice the Applicant\nreceived, it was reasonable to install a system that used monitors. Furthermore,\nwe consider it is reasonable to keep that equipment somewhere that is secure.\nHowever, we do not consider it is necessary to rent a room in order to do that.\nWe consider renting a secure cupboard would be sufficient.\n156. We saw evidence that the room was indeed being used for more than just CCTV\nstorage. For instance, the room also contained a desk, chair, sink, and\nequipment, which the Respondent believes is associated with the\ntelecommunications masts. Although CCTV monitors were present, there was\nno one monitoring them. While we accepted that installing CCTV with monitors\nwas a reasonable security measure, and that the equipment should be stored\nsecurely, we did not find it necessary to rent an entire room, albeit a small one,\nfor this purpose. We concluded that a secure cupboard would have sufficed\nwhich would cost less to rent. Therefore, we consider that a secure cupboard\ncould have been rented for approximately £35 per week in 2020, which is the\namount we consider is reasonable to recover as rent, with annual increases to\nreflect the consumer price index.\n24\n\nUnblocking Drainage\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n157. Tribunal considers the cost of unblocking drains at £960.00 for the year ending\n2022 is unreasonable, and reduce this to £675.00.\nReasons for the Tribunal’s Decision\n158. Mr K Anand’s oral evidence was that the Applicant receives complaints from\nabout blocked drains, and the costs being claimed reflect the amount paid to\nunblock the drains.\n159. Mr Patel challenged this, and pointed to the absence of any written record of\nthe complaints. However, Mr K Anand remained firm that these complaints had\nbeen received, and actioned, which is reflected in the costs being claimed for\nthe drains being unblocked. As to the invoice dated 10th January 2021, relating\nto a visit on 26th January 2021, Mr Patel asked whether this was a false invoice\nbecause the visit postdates the invoice. Mr K Anand denied this, stating it was\nan error.\n160. Mr Patel argued that the costs are unreasonable, particularly because the work\nis carried out by a general contractor who does not use any specialist\nequipment. He also argues that the invoices provided total £675 not the £920\nbeing claimed.\n161. Mr Patel raised a further point in connection with these charges. He put to Mr\nK Anand that by paragraph 1 of the first schedule of the TP1 recording the\ntransfer of the garage block to Mr K Anand (see paragraph 17 above) it was\nagreed that drainage would “ … be maintained at the joint and equal expense\nof the persons entitled to use them.”\n162. According to Mr Patel, this means that Mr K Anand personally, as the\ntransferee, should jointly and equally share the cost of unblocking the drains\nwith leaseholders. Mr K Anand denied this stating that there is no drainage on\nthe land transferred to him.\n163. It was put to the Respondent during cross examination that occupiers of the\nProperty, as a top floor flat, may be unaware of blockages affecting properties\non lower floors. The Respondent accepted that could be the case.\n164. In deciding this issue we note that there was a sink in the rented room, which\nsuggest that, contrary to Mr K Anand’s evidence, there is drainage in this area.\nNonetheless we find that it is reasonable to engage a general contractor to\nunblock drainage, and based on the evidence available, specialist equipment\nwas not required. Repeated blocked drains are not unusual, particularly where\nmultiple households share drainage, such as in a block of flats.

Where the Respondent calculates invoices amount to a higher sum than is being\nclaimed, we have based our determination on the lower amount claimed by the\nApplicant.\n166. In addition to the unsatisfactory management of the Building, we noted\nconflicts of interests, in particular between the Applicant, KPLA, Mr K Anand,\nMr P Anand and Mr A Anand relating to the dealings with the Building and the\nEstate. We note that the RICS Code advises that property managers should do\ntheir utmost to avoid conflicts of interests. We found the Applicant’s record\nkeeping to be poor, and the vast majority of the copious documents were\ndocuments typed by the Applicant and KLPA, with minimal third party\ndocumentation. At times Mr K Anand displayed a cavalier approach to his\nresponsibilities, for instance suggesting that because the Respondents have not\npaid service charges he does not need to provide information regarding the\ninsurance.\nCosts\n167. The Tribunal has issued separate Directions in relation to the costs application.\nName: Judge Tueje Date: 10th July 2025\n27\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber)\nRules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any right of appeal they\nmay have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber), then\na written application for permission must be made to the First-tier Tribunal at the\nregional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office within 28\ndays after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the person making the\napplication.\nIf the application is not made within the 28-day time limit, such application must\ninclude a request for an extension of time and the reason for not complying with the\n28-day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such reason(s) and decide whether to\nallow the application for permission to appeal to proceed, despite not being within the\ntime limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the tribunal to\nwhich it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case number), state the grounds\nof appeal and state the result the party making the application is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n28\n\nAPPENDIX\nExtracts from the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985\n18.— Meaning of “service charge” and “relevant costs”\n(1) In the following provisions of this Act “service charge” means an amount\npayable by a tenant of a dwelling as part of or in addition to the rent—\n(a) which is payable, directly or indirectly, for services, repairs,\nmaintenance improvements or insurance or the landlord’s costs of\nmanagement, and\n(b) the whole or part of which varies or may vary according to the relevant\ncosts.\n(2) The relevant costs are the costs or estimated costs incurred or to be incurred\nby or on behalf of the landlord, or a superior landlord, in connection with the\nmatters for which the service charge is payable.\n(3) For this purpose—\n(a) “costs” includes overheads, and\n(b) costs are relevant costs in relation to a service charge whether they are\nincurred, or to be incurred, in the period for which the service charge is\npayable or in an earlier or later period.\n19.- Limitation of service charges: reasonableness\n(1) Relevant costs shall be taken into account in determining the amount of\nservice charge payable for a period-\n(a) only to the extent that they are reasonably incurred, and\n(b) where they are incurred on the provision of services or the carrying out\nof works, only if the services or works are of a reasonable standard;\nand the amount payable shall be limited accordingly.\n(2) Where a service charge is payable before the relevant costs are incurred, no\ngreater amount than is reasonable is so payable, and after the relevant\ncosts have been incurred any necessary adjustment shall be made by\nrepayment, reduction or subsequent charges or otherwise.\n20.- Limitation of service charges: consultation requirements\n(1) Where this section applies to any qualifying works or qualifying long term\nagreement, the relevant contributions of tenants are limited in accordance\nwith subsection (6) or (7) (or both) unless the consultation requirements\nhave been either—\n(a) complied with in relation to the works or agreement, or\n(b) dispensed with in relation to the works or agreement by (or on appeal\nfrom) the appropriate tribunal.\n29\n\n(2) In this section “relevant contribution” , in relation to a tenant and any\nworks or agreement, is the amount which he may be required under the\nterms of his lease to contribute (by the payment of service charges) to\nrelevant costs incurred on carrying out the works or under the agreement.\n(3) This section applies to qualifying works if relevant costs incurred on\ncarrying out the works exceed an appropriate amount.\n(4) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that this section applies\nto a qualifying long term agreement—\n(a) if relevant costs incurred under the agreement exceed an appropriate\namount, or\n(b) if relevant costs incurred under the agreement during a period\nprescribed by the regulations exceed an appropriate amount.\n(5) An appropriate amount is an amount set by regulations made by the\nSecretary of State; and the regulations may make provision for either or\nboth of the following to be an appropriate amount—\n(a) an amount prescribed by, or determined in accordance with, the\nregulations, and\n(b) an amount which results in the relevant contribution of any one or\nmore tenants being an amount prescribed by, or determined in\naccordance with, the regulations.\n(6) Where an appropriate amount is set by virtue of paragraph (a) of\nsubsection (5), the amount of the relevant costs incurred on carrying out\nthe works or under the agreement which may be taken into account in\ndetermining the relevant contributions of tenants is limited to the\nappropriate amount.\n(7) Where an appropriate amount is set by virtue of paragraph (b) of that\nsubsection, the amount of the relevant contribution of the tenant, or each of\nthe tenants, whose relevant contribution would otherwise exceed the\namount prescribed by, or determined in accordance with, the regulations is\nlimited to the amount so prescribed or determined.\n27A Liability to pay service charges: jurisdiction\n(1) An application may be made to the appropriate tribunal for a determination\nwhether a service charge is payable and, if it is, as to—\n(a) the person by whom it is payable,\n(b) the person to whom it is payable,\n(c) the amount which is payable,\n(d) the date at or by which it is payable, and\n(e) the manner in which it is payable.\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not any payment has been made.\n30\n\nExtracts from the Service Charges (Consultation Requirements)\n(England) Regulations 2003 – paragraph 4\n(1) Section 20 shall apply to a qualifying long term agreement if relevant costs\nincurred under the agreement in any accounting period exceed an amount\nwhich results in the relevant contribution of any tenant, in respect of that\nperiod, being more than £100.\n(2) In paragraph (1), “accounting period” means the period-\n(a) beginning with the relevant date, and\n(b) ending with the date that falls 12 months after the relevant\ndate.\n31"

The rent to have effect from the date in the landlords notice of 25th\nFebruary 2021 which is 5th April 2021.\nBackground\n1. The tribunal received an application under section 13 of the Housing\nAct 1988 dated 25th February 2021. This included the landlord’s notice\nproposing a new rent to commence on 5th April 2021.\n2. Neither party requested an oral hearing and written representations\nwere received from the applicant and respondent.\n3. The tenancy commenced 12th August 2019. The proposed rent coming\ninto effect on 5th April 2021 is £263.63 per week, up from a previous\nrent of £257.16 per week.\n4. The accommodation the subject of the tenancy, comprises a flat on the\nsecond floor, with two double bedrooms, one single bedroom, one\nliving room and a bathroom and kitchen. The property is centrally\nheated, has double glazing, curtains and carpets and white goods. The\nalso has a garden and an off-road parking space.\n5. The applicant relies on the application form and reply form which sets\nout the dimensions of the property.\nThe Law\n6. The tribunal first had to determine that the tribunal had jurisdiction to\nhear the Application in order to determine a rent under S14 of the\nHousing Act 1988. In short, the tribunal must determine that the\nLandlord’s notice under Section 13(2) satisfied the requirements of that\nsection and was validly served.\n7. The Act provides in section 13 (2) as amended by the Regulatory\nReform (Assured Periodic Tenancies) (Rent Increases) Order 2003 that\nthe date in paragraph 4 of the Landlord’s notice (the date the new rent\nbecomes payable) must comply with three requirements.\n2\n\n8. The first requirement is that a minimum period of notice must be given\nbefore the proposed new rent can take effect.\n9. The second requirement is that the starting date must not be less than\n52 weeks after the date on which the rent was last increased using this\nprocedure although there are exceptions to this.\n10. The third requirement is that the proposed new rent must start at the\nbeginning of a period of the tenancy.\n11. In the present case, the Tenancy started on 12th August 2019.\n12. Section 14 of the Housing Act 1988 requires the tribunal to determine\nthe rent at which it considered the subject property might reasonably\nbe expected to be let on the open market by a willing landlord under an\nassured tenancy.\n13. Only if a landlord’s notice complies with each of the\nrequirements referred to above does a tribunal have jurisdiction to\ndetermine a rent under section 14 of the Act.\nThe Decision\n14. The tribunal determined that the three requirements were met.\n15. In coming to its decision, the tribunal relied on its own general\nknowledge of rental levels in the area and any evidence supplied by the\nappellant and the respondent.\n16. Given the size and nature of the accommodation, the tribunal\ndetermines the rent at £1350 per calendar month, which is £311.54 per\nweek , effective from the 5th April 2021.\nTribunal Valuer Chair\nName: Date: 14th March 2022.\nWaterhouse\n3\n\nRights of appeal\nBy rule 36(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property\nChamber) Rules 2013, the tribunal is required to notify the parties about any\nright of appeal they may have.\nIf a party wishes to appeal this decision to the Upper Tribunal (Lands\nChamber), then a written application for permission must be made to the\nFirst-tier Tribunal at the regional office which has been dealing with the case.\nThe application for permission to appeal must arrive at the regional office\nwithin 28 days after the tribunal sends written reasons for the decision to the\nperson making the application.\nIf the application is not made within the 28 day time limit, such application\nmust include a request for an extension of time and the reason for not\ncomplying with the 28 day time limit; the tribunal will then look at such\nreason(s) and decide whether to allow the application for permission to appeal\nto proceed, despite not being within the time limit.\nThe application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the\ntribunal to which it relates (i.e. give the date, the property and the case\nnumber), state the grounds of appeal and state the result the party making the\napplication is seeking.\nIf the tribunal refuses to grant permission to appeal, a further application for\npermission may be made to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber).\n4\n\nTHE LEGISLATION\nHousing Act 1988\ns.13.— Increases of rent under assured periodic tenancies.\n(1) This section applies to—\n(a) a statutory periodic tenancy other than one which, by virtue of paragraph 11\nor paragraph 12 in Part I of Schedule 1 to this Act, cannot for the time being be\nan assured tenancy; and\n(b) any other periodic tenancy which is an assured tenancy, other than one in\nrelation to which there is a provision, for the time being binding on the tenant,\nunder which the rent for a particular period of the tenancy will or may be greater\nthan the rent for an earlier period.\n(2) For the purpose of securing an increase in the rent under a tenancy to which\nthis section applies, the landlord may serve on the tenant a notice in the\nprescribed form proposing a new rent to take effect at the beginning of a new\nperiod of the tenancy specified in the notice, being a period beginning not earlier\nthan—\n(a) the minimum period after the date of the service of the notice; and\n(b) except in the case of a statutory periodic [tenancy—]\n[\n(i) in the case of an assured agricultural occupancy, the first anniversary of the\ndate on which the first period of the tenancy began;\n(ii) in any other case, on the date that falls 52 weeks after the date on which the\nfirst period of the tenancy began; and\n]\n(c) if the rent under the tenancy has previously been increased by virtue of a\nnotice under this subsection or a determination under section 14[below—]\n[\n(i) in the case of an assured agricultural occupancy, the first anniversary of the\ndate on which the increased rent took effect;\n(ii) in any other case, the appropriate date.\n]\n(3) The minimum period referred to in subsection (2) above is—\n(a) in the case of a yearly tenancy, six months;\n(b) in the case of a tenancy where the period is less than a month, one month;\nand\n(c) in any other case, a period equal to the period of the tenancy.\n[\n(3A) The appropriate date referred to in subsection (2)(c)(ii) above is—\n(a) in a case to which subsection (3B) below applies, the date that falls 53 weeks\nafter the date on which the increased rent took effect;\n(b) in any other case, the date that falls 52 weeks after the date on which the\nincreased rent took effect.\n(3B) This subsection applies where—\n(a) the rent under the tenancy has been increased by virtue of a notice under\nthis section or a determination under section 14 below on at least one occasion\nafter the coming into force of the Regulatory Reform (Assured Periodic\nTenancies) (Rent Increases) Order 2003; and\n5\n\n(b) the fifty-third week after the date on which the last such increase took effect\nbegins more than six days before the anniversary of the date on which the first\nsuch increase took effect.\n]\n(4) Where a notice is served under subsection (2) above, a new rent specified in\nthe notice shall take effect as mentioned in the notice unless, before the\nbeginning of the new period specified in the notice,—\n(a) the tenant by an application in the prescribed form refers the notice to [the\nappropriate tribunal] ; or\n(b) the landlord and the tenant agree on a variation of the rent which is different\nfrom that proposed in the notice or agree that the rent should not be varied.\n(5) Nothing in this section (or in section 14 below) affects the right of the\nlandlord and the tenant under an assured tenancy to vary by agreement any\nterm of the tenancy (including a term relating to rent).\ns.14.— Determination of rent by [tribunal] .\n(1) Where, under subsection (4)(a) of section 13 above, a tenant refers to [the\nappropriate tribunal] a notice under subsection (2) of that section, the\n[appropriate tribunal]3 shall determine the rent at which, subject to subsections\n(2) and (4) below, the [appropriate tribunal]3 consider that the dwelling-house\nconcerned might reasonably be expected to be let in the open market by a willing\nlandlord under an assured tenancy—\n(a) which is a periodic tenancy having the same periods as those of the tenancy\nto which the notice relates;\n(b) which begins at the beginning of the new period specified in the notice;\n(c) the terms of which (other than relating to the amount of the rent) are the\nsame as those of the tenancy to which the notice relates; and\n(d) in respect of which the same notices, if any, have been given under any of\nGrounds 1 to 5 of Schedule 2 to this Act, as have been given (or have effect as if\ngiven) in relation to the tenancy to which the notice relates.\n(2) In making a determination under this section, there shall be disregarded—\n(a) any effect on the rent attributable to the granting of a tenancy to a sitting\ntenant;\n(b) any increase in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a relevant\nimprovement carried out by a person who at the time it was carried out was the\ntenant, if the improvement—\n(i) was carried out otherwise than in pursuance of an obligation to his\nimmediate landlord, or\n(ii) was carried out pursuant to an obligation to his immediate landlord being an\nobligation which did not relate to the specific improvement concerned but arose\nby reference to consent given to the carrying out of that improvement; and\n(c) any reduction in the value of the dwelling-house attributable to a failure by\nthe tenant to comply with any terms of the tenancy.\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) above, in relation to a notice which is\nreferred by a tenant as mentioned in subsection (1) above, an improvement is a\nrelevant improvement if either it was carried out during the tenancy to which the\nnotice relates or the following conditions are satisfied, namely—\n(a) that it was carried out not more than twenty-one years before the date of\nservice of the notice; and\n6\n\n(b) that, at all times during the period beginning when the improvement was\ncarried out and ending on the date of service of the notice, the dwelling-house\nhas been let under an assured tenancy; and\n(c) that, on the coming to an end of an assured tenancy at any time during that\nperiod, the tenant (or, in the case of joint tenants, at least one of them) did not\nquit.\n[\n(3A) In making a determination under this section in any case where under Part\nI of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 the landlord or a superior landlord\nis\nliable to pay council tax in respect of a hereditament (“the relevant\nhereditament”) of which the dwelling-house forms part, the [appropriate\ntribunal] shall have regard to the amount of council tax which, as at the date on\nwhich the notice under section 13(2) above was served, was set by the billing\nauthority—\n(a) for the financial year in which that notice was served, and\n(b) for the category of dwellings within which the relevant hereditament fell on\nthat date,\nbut any discount or other reduction affecting the amount of council tax payable\nshall be disregarded.\n(3B) In subsection (3A) above—\n(a) “hereditament” means a dwelling within the meaning of Part I of the Local\nGovernment Finance Act 1992,\n(b) “billing authority” has the same meaning as in that Part of that Act, and\n(c) “category of dwellings” has the same meaning as in section 30(1) and (2) of\nthat Act.\n(4) In this section “rent” does not include any service charge, within the\nmeaning of section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 , but, subject to that,\nincludes any sums payable by the tenant to the landlord on account of the use of\nfurniture [, in respect of council tax] or for any of the matters referred to in\nsubsection (1)(a) of that section, whether or not those sums are separate from\nthe sums payable for the occupation of the dwelling-house concerned or are\npayable under separate agreements.\n(5) Where any rates in respect of the dwelling-house concerned are borne by\nthe landlord or a superior landlord, the [appropriate tribunal] shall make their\ndetermination under this section as if the rates were not so borne.\n(6) In any case where—\n(a) [the appropriate tribunal] have before them at the same time the reference\nof a notice under section 6(2) above relating to a tenancy (in this subsection\nreferred to as “the section 6 reference”) and the reference of a notice under\nsection 13(2) above relating to the same tenancy (in this subsection referred to\nas “the section 13 reference”), and\n(b) the date specified in the notice under section 6(2) above is not later than the\nfirst day of the new period specified in the notice under section 13(2) above, and\n(c) the [appropriate tribunal]9 propose to hear the two references together,\nthe [appropriate tribunal] shall make a determination in relation to the section\n6 reference before making their determination in relation to the section 13\nreference and, accordingly, in such a case the reference in subsection (1)(c)\nabove to the terms of the tenancy to which the notice relates shall be construed\n7\n\nas a reference to those terms as varied by virtue of the determination made in\nrelation to the section 6 reference.\n(7) Where a notice under section 13(2) above has been referred to [the\nappropriate tribunal] , then, unless the landlord and the tenant otherwise agree,\nthe rent determined by [the appropriate tribunal] (subject, in a case where\nsubsection (5) above applies, to the addition of the appropriate amount in\nrespect of rates) shall be the rent under the tenancy with effect from the\nbeginning of the new period specified in the notice or, if it appears to [the\nappropriate tribunal] that that would cause undue hardship to the tenant,\nthat that would cause undue hardship to the tenant, with effect from such later\ndate (not being later than the date the rent is determined) as the committee may\ndirect.\n(8) Nothing in this section requires [the appropriate tribunal] to continue with\ntheir determination of a rent for a dwelling-house if the landlord and tenant give\nnotice in writing that they no longer require such a determination or if the\ntenancy has come to an end.\n(9) This section shall apply in relation to an assured shorthold tenancy as if in\nsubsection (1) the reference to an assured tenancy were a reference to an\nassured shorthold tenancy.\n8"

Harris Date of decision 1 September 2021\nFR24\n\nMAXIMUM FAIR RENT CALCULATION\nLATEST RPI FIGURE X 305.5\nPREVIOUS RPI FIGURE Y 278.1\nX 305.5 Minus Y 278.1 = (A) 27.4\n(A) 27.4 Divided by Y 278.1 = (B) 0.098525\nFirst application for re-registration since 1 February 1999 YES/NO\nIf yes (B) plus 1.075 = (C)\nIf no (B) plus 1.05 = (C) 1.14852571\nLast registered rent* 155 Multiplied by (C) = 14760.71\n*(exclusive of any variable service charge)\nRounded up to nearest 50p = 178.5\nVariable service charge NO\nIf YES add amount for services\nMAXIMUM FAIR RENT = £178.5 Per week\nExplanatory Note\n1. The calculation of the maximum fair rent, in accordance with the formula contained in the Order, is set\nout above.\n2. In summary, the formula provides for the maximum fair rent to be calculated by:\n(a) increasing the previous registered rent by the percentage change in the retail price index (the RPI)\nsince the date of that earlier registration and\n(b) adding a further 7.5% (if the present application was the first since 1 February 1999) or 5% (if it is a\nsecond or subsequent application since that date).\nA 7.5% increase is represented, in the calculation set out above, by the addition of 1.075 to (B) and\nan increase of 5% is represented by the addition of 1.05 to (B).\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest 50 pence.\n3. For the purposes of the calculation the latest RPI figure (x) is that published in the calendar month\nimmediately before the month in which the Tribunal’s fair rent determination was made.\n4. The process differs where the tenancy agreement contains a variable service charge and the rent is to\nbe registered as variable under section 71(4) of the Rent Act 1977. In such a case the variable service\ncharge is removed before applying the formula. When the amount determined by the application of the\nformula is ascertained the service charge is then added to that sum in order to produce the maximum\nfair rent.\nFR24"
